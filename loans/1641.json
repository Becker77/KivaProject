Meet Everlyne, 44 years of age and a proud mother of three. She is very ambitious and enterprising, and a go-getting woman who hails from the Kitale area of Kenya. She has been doing mixed farming for the past five years. Her primary sources of income are egg selling, milk selling, and some personal business that she does to make ends meet. Everlyne loves farming, taking really good care of her dairy cows and even nicknaming her cow. The Kitale area has favorable conditions that favor horticulture farming: good soil, good climate, a good transport system and a ready market for horticulture products. Everlyne wants to take advantage and start horticultural farming.

Meet Rosemary, 37 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Maili saba, a remote village in Kitale. She is happily married and is blessed with seven adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. <br \/><br \/>The Kitale area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable. She stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 15,000 KES to buy poultry. Being a woman, accessing funds is very challenging. Through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market. This will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets. This will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":143.87,"image":{"id":1787519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-06T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T20:20:04Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.77,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1061.59},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1092.62},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1124.55},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1157.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1191.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1226.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1261.89},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1298.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1336.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1375.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1416},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1457.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.9},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.53,"local_amount":2359.98,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2494.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824721},{"amount":13.19,"local_amount":1130.59,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1195.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264910},{"amount":13.05,"local_amount":1118.79,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1182.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601084},{"amount":14.19,"local_amount":1216.58,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1285.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459546},{"amount":13.68,"local_amount":1196.14,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1264.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.27,"payment_id":681377957},{"amount":14.58,"local_amount":1282.39,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1355.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.38,"payment_id":696587630},{"amount":25.2,"local_amount":2283.01,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2413.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.44,"payment_id":711505937},{"amount":14.97,"local_amount":1329.58,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1405.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.54,"payment_id":731022759},{"amount":4.71,"local_amount":415.91,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":439.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.14,"payment_id":752110952}],"funded_date":"2015-01-07T20:05:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":824424,"name":"Afsheen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Afsheen is a 29-year-old married woman.

Now that the corn harvesting has begun, they work as day laborer in the county.\r\nCeledonia is a very simple woman. She is 49 years old, she is married with Francisco and they have six children, even though only their six-year-old daughter depends on them. Francisco works in construction, but at the moment he is not working at any project because he spends the majority of his time in the country.\r\nAround 30 years ago, Celedonia started breeding and selling animals such as lambs, pigs and calves. She says, \u201csince I got married, I have wanted to help paying for the household expenses and for my children\u2019s education\u201d; she then started running the activity she already had experience in. Celedonia buys the animals and keeps them for four or five months: during this time she breeds and feeds them very well in order to earn more money.\r\nCeledonia needs to buy bags of food for the three calves she is about to buy. Her husband has recently finished repairing their yard, as it was very small: now it is ready to welcome the calves who need more space.\r\nCeledonia is greatly moved when she says that she loves caring for her animals, because it is through them that she can provide for her family; she faces challenges only when they get sick, but luckily the vet visits the animals directly in her house.\r\nCeledonia has only one dream: to succeed in keeping on providing for her youngest daughter, as she would love for her to have a professional career.\r\nAll the members of the group are very happy because the loan will help them improve their activities: Maria L. will buy clothes, Patricia will buy chickens, Mar\u00eda E and Alberta will buy lambs, and Concepci\u00f3n will increase her embroidery activity. They all engage in creating embroidered handicrafts, as it is typical of their region. They use these crafts to decorate their tables of to trim their tortillas hampers.\r\n*The picture has been taken outside Celedonia\u2019s house and all the members are showing some of their embroidery.

He chose farming. He is growing fruits and vegetables in his own yard.\r\n\r\nSaxavat has 7 years of experience in this field, thanks to his father, but his situation is very hard.

This is true for Nancy, 32, who is based in the Eldoret area of Kenya and is a mother of one lovely child. She has been practicing mixed farming for the past 10 years. She has managed to earn a decent income. Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d Her hobby is milking Browny (the name of her dairy cow). She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet the demand. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow; it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10-20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit margins and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. Nancy is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling, and also to start selling dairy products such as yogurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets.\r\nSupport Nancy so that she can continue with her dairy farming!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":583.1,"image":{"id":1759707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-22T20:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T20:50:05Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.91,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":63100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4465.77},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4596.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4730.61},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4868.86},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5011.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5157.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5308.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5463.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5623.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5787.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5956.62},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":6130.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.89},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.59,"local_amount":4740.31,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4761.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824676},{"amount":59.67,"local_amount":5378.7,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5402.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262689},{"amount":50.96,"local_amount":4593.57,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4614.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264872},{"amount":49.04,"local_amount":4420.23,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4440.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601042},{"amount":63.87,"local_amount":5757.53,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5783.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459510},{"amount":56.64,"local_amount":5208.88,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5232.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.14,"payment_id":681377920},{"amount":58.71,"local_amount":5435.55,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5460.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.59,"payment_id":696587594},{"amount":116.03,"local_amount":10838.91,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":10887.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.21,"payment_id":731022721},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":6188.18,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6216.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.97,"payment_id":752110915}],"funded_date":"2014-12-23T12:48:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":824436,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is 38 years old and has two children.

Meet Scola, an ever-smiling young farmer who is responsible and has had to overcome many difficulties through her life. However, she has always found the strength to move forward and to keep growing in her life. She has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture. She is the proud owner of a small parcel of land, on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years. Her primary sources of income are selling eggs and milk, and through this venture she has earned a decent income. She also engages in personal business in order to make ends meet. Scola passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cows. Although this humble mum has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. Scola is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. With the loan capital, she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 litres of milk a day. This will help to fully satisfy the demand. Through Juhudi Kilimo, which is a field partner, she attended training sessions and was taught the best financial management skills. This will help her save more money in order to repay the loan fully and to improve her living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":316.94,"image":{"id":1759713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-22T20:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T20:50:05Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.62,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Scola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":32050,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2268.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2334.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2402.79},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2473.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2545.28},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2619.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2696.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2775.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2856.14},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2939.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3025.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3113.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.94},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.39},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.65,"local_amount":2363.34,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2503.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824678},{"amount":30.15,"local_amount":2577,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2730.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262690},{"amount":27.8,"local_amount":2375.68,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2516.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264873},{"amount":30.44,"local_amount":2601.24,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2755.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601043},{"amount":31.55,"local_amount":2696.3,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2856.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459511},{"amount":30.9,"local_amount":2694.1,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2854.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.62,"payment_id":681377921},{"amount":32.39,"local_amount":2843.32,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3012.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.88,"payment_id":696587595},{"amount":32.45,"local_amount":2934.42,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3108.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.88,"payment_id":711505899},{"amount":33.15,"local_amount":2936.84,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3111.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.21,"payment_id":731022722},{"amount":34.84,"local_amount":3065.39,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3247.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.03,"payment_id":752110916}],"funded_date":"2014-12-23T03:09:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":824386,"name":"Mebo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello!

In this valley are a people who, in their totality, constitute wrenching statistics. Hardcore poverty pervades every homestead.  Yet every day when you look beyond the numbers, you will see a sea of about 1,000 bright, vibrant, open faces, searching and yearning for the opportunity to live a life of dignity and respect. They have the conviction that it\u2019s possible. Armed with this conviction, Susan has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. \r\n\r\nSusan is seeking a loan to expand her horticulture farm. She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output. Loans for smallholder farmers with little, irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Susan. Through a group of 10 members called Kopsirita, Susan has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Susan because the institution believes that women, too, are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":290.2,"image":{"id":1759729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-22T21:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T21:00:06Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.84,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.75,"local_amount":4864.17,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5138.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824680},{"amount":53,"local_amount":4542.54,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4798.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264874},{"amount":56.23,"local_amount":4819.42,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5091.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459512},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":5135.43,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5425.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.58,"payment_id":696587596},{"amount":62.05,"local_amount":5511.91,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5822.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.26,"payment_id":731022723}],"funded_date":"2014-12-22T23:39:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":816667,"name":"Magret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magret used the previous loan to buy general merchandise such as sugar and salt to sell.

Her biggest challenge over the years as a farmer has been lack of adequate capital. It is very hard for small-holder farmers to save enough capital for expansion since farming is marred with all sorts of external risks such as climatic conditions, pests and diseases, political instability, fluctuation of prices and high costs of inputs. Because of these factors, the sure way farmers can obtain adequate capital is through leveraging their businesses. \n\nWith your loan investment, Elizabeth is going to expand her farm in order to increase its output.

It is the major occupation of the inhabitants, providing employment directly or indirectly for at least 75% of the people. This writing draws your attention to Anne, who relies on the dairy cow and poultry she keeps to make a living. Anne is a hardworking and committed mother who is a smallholder farmer in Eldoret. She has been practicing dairy farming for six years now. She also keeps poultry and grows vegetables for subsistence. \r\n\r\nAnne passionately loves dairy farming, but the biggest challenge she faces is feeding her cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. She is seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter. The chaff cutter will assist Anne in cutting hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forage to feed her cow. Also, it will aid the animal\u2019s digestion and prevent the animals from rejecting any part of their food. \r\n\r\nBefore Anne joined Juhudi Kilimo, a Kenyan microfinance institution supporting smallholder farmers with technical and financial solutions. She considered dairy farming to be a mediocre fallback occupation that did not have a future promise for income generation. After training, she now believes that dairy farming is the business to go into if you want a rather less rough way into the \u201cmillionaires club\u201d. An increase in income will allow Anne to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children. Her dream is to continue improving her dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards. Anne fears that her dreams might not be realized if Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders cease to provide the reliable market channel, credit facility and services that she requires to grow her dairy

in an urban area of the district belonging to the province of Cotopaxi. She is married and has two children. Thanks to the efforts of her parents, she managed to attend school as far as primary level, then she left her studies as she had the new challenge of looking after her daughter. This is how she came to start working from a young age to look after her young child.<br \/><br \/>It was not easy for Ermita to leave her parents, as she was the favourite at home. She suffered a great deal, but she struggled hard to be a good mother and wife and thus be able to provide the best she could for her children. She didn't allow the pain she felt to overcome her. Now she is very happy because God and life have given her the opportunity to see her children grow up.<br \/><br \/>Ermita and her family now live in their own home, and Ermita has been working making handicraft products for several years. In spite of having a job that demands a lot of effort and time, she always dedicates a lot of time to caring for her young children.

She owns several cows and cultivates alfalfa for their forage. Prior to owning the biodigester, she was buying expensive LP gas to cook and heat water in the house, as well as chemical fertilizers for her field. These were not only costly, but also unsustainable solutions which damaged her environment. From now on, Maria Cristina will use her cows' manure to produce methane-rich biogas as well as a nutrient-rich fertilizer she will spread on her fields to produce more and better quality forage for her cows. The cycle is closed, Maria Cristina will save money and live in a more comfortable environment, as the flies will not be attracted by the piles of waste anymore.

He is 22 years old and owns a milling machine. This is because many of the villagers depend on posho and millet, so he has a ready market, The machine engine is however broken down and he does not have enough funds to buy the new engine.

Due to problems within the group they have restructured about 30% with people who know each other.\r\n\r\nElena is the group's representative (in the photo she is the one seated in the middle). She is 45 years old and has two children, 24 and 16 years old. She sells clothing.  She is a good mother and an independent, enterprising, hard-working, and responsible person. She sells in the southern region, where trade and commerce are increasing. It has a tropical climate and is humid with constant temperatures of 30 degrees Centigrade (86 F) all year.\r\n\r\nElena has a dark complexion, is of medium height and stocky build, and has long, black, curly hair. Her mother tongue is Qechua and she speaks Spanish. She lives a private house belonging to her family.  It is built of bricks and has potable water and electricity. \r\n\r\nHer desire to get ahead motivated her to form a bank with people who have a variety of businesses. She sells seasonal items. For example: at Christmastime she buys toys, decorations, Christmas trees, lights, etc. at wholesale and sells them at fairs and markets. When this season is over, she buys things for Carnival such as costumes, water balloons, water guns, and clothing (which she sells at both times of year). Her marketing varies by the date and holiday.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own store in a fixed place of business so she doesn't have to be a street vendor. At this time she wants to buy her merchandise (clothing) at wholesale so she can sell it before the end-of-year holidays and keep her business running.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan sequence with the institution in the ten years she has been in business. This is why Elena is asking for a loan: to buy seasonal clothing at wholesale so she can sell it for the end-of--year holidays.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4800,"image":{"id":1758645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy seasonal clothing at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-22T22:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T22:00:01Z","loan_amount":4800,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marleni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Donato","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":33000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2572.09},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2575.15},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2611.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2648.98},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2686.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2724.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2763.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2803.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.14},{"due_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2892.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2924.41},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2965.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":374.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":374.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":379.9},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.79},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":401.99},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":407.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":374.12,"local_amount":2572.09,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2585.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157446},{"amount":754.47,"local_amount":5186.95,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:41:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5213.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554396},{"amount":776.1,"local_amount":5335.66,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5362.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226944},{"amount":798.34,"local_amount":5488.63,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5516.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214120},{"amount":1240.2,"local_amount":8526.36,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":8569.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564246},{"amount":856.77,"local_amount":5890.31,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5919.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046220}],"funded_date":"2014-12-25T17:02:06Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:10:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":816898,"name":"Hesti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hesti is a 43-year-old woman who is married to Maxi, a 48-year-old man.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Meet Martha. She is 41 years old. She comes from Kitale, which is a town in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Martha is a smallholder farmer who keeps dairy cattle and poultry. She is also an entrepreneur engaged in other small personal businesses (sewing business). For the five years that Martha has been doing farming, she finds milking to be the most enjoyable activity. However, she doesn't enjoy cleaning the dairy unit as much. There is no doubting her deep connection to farm animals, as she names and occasionally talks to her animals. Martha is seeking a loan to purchase farm implements. Farming tools are very crucial to all farmers regardless of the nature of the agribusiness they are involved in. With your loan, Martha will acquire farm implements that will make her work in the field much easier and efficient. These benefits will translate to efficiency, improved quality and profits. Additional income as a result will help Martha to foot the high farming costs that keep rising by the day. When asked, \"How will this loan benefit your family?,\" Martha replied, \"More income will help me buy more assets and be able to pay school fees for my school going children.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":289.59,"image":{"id":1787625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy farm implements","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-06T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.49,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2150.41},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2213.26},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2277.94},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2344.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2413.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2483.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2556.13},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2630.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2707.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2786.85},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2868.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2952.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3038.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3127.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3218.59},{"due_date":"2016-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.65},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3409.4},{"due_date":"2016-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3509.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.73},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.45},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.56},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.14},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.94},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.96},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.01},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.21},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":151.1,"local_amount":13138.75,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":13689.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824725},{"amount":21.59,"local_amount":1913.65,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1993.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.42,"payment_id":681377959},{"amount":29.45,"local_amount":2628.66,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2738.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.78,"payment_id":696587632},{"amount":24.63,"local_amount":2264.7,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2359.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.41,"payment_id":711505939},{"amount":29.54,"local_amount":2660.19,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2771.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.05,"payment_id":731022761},{"amount":28.79,"local_amount":2575.77,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2683.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.83,"payment_id":752110954}],"funded_date":"2015-01-29T14:40:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cheryl Strecker","image":1412668}},{"id":818578,"name":"Mumuli S C C Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Harriet, a married woman living in Kagadi, Uganda, is aged 43 years.

Tomatoes are Florence's flagship produce.\r\n\r\nBack in 2000, Florence practiced traditional farming with little knowledge and no financing at all. She was doing only half an acre of maize crop per season. The returns were so meager that she could barely survive. She kept doing maize farming for years without turning a profit until 2008, when she switched to tomato farming and there was light at the end of the tunnel for her. \r\n\r\nToday, Florence is a fully-fledged entrepreneur. She has been provided with technical guidance, training programs and exposure visits. She has already serviced other asset-based loans fully from Juhudi Kilimo! Through the loans, she has acquired high quality dairy cows and farming supplies\r\n\r\nTo capitalize more on returns from her booming tomato farming business, Florence is seeking a loan of KES 100,000 to build a greenhouse. Unlike her competitors, Florence conducts proper soil preparation and uses modern farming techniques to ensure high quality produce. By doing this, she has created a name for herself and a demand for her produce. \r\n\r\nBy supporting this loan, you can put into action the enterprising ideas of one Kenyan mother."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":915.16,"image":{"id":1784934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To construct a greenhouse for tomatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-06T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.86,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":7077.29},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":7284.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":7497},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":7716.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":7941.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8173.7},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8412.57},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8658.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8911.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":9171.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":9439.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":9715.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.41},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.18},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.81,"local_amount":7272.33,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":7412.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824698},{"amount":84.05,"local_amount":7470.7,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":7614.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262710},{"amount":83.53,"local_amount":7425.31,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:51Z","rounded_local_amount":7568.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264894},{"amount":91.18,"local_amount":8104.48,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":8260.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601066},{"amount":85.75,"local_amount":7622.59,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":7769.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459530},{"amount":90.98,"local_amount":8245.49,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":8404.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.78,"payment_id":681377939},{"amount":94.07,"local_amount":8583.38,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":8748.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.49,"payment_id":696587615},{"amount":90.44,"local_amount":8500.39,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":8664.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.19,"payment_id":711505920},{"amount":98.49,"local_amount":9068.54,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:09Z","rounded_local_amount":9243.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.53,"payment_id":731022743},{"amount":99,"local_amount":9055.31,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":9229.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.87,"payment_id":752110934}],"funded_date":"2015-01-24T02:42:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Ingram","image":566975}},{"id":824455,"name":"Benon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benon is 37 years old and married.

Hace 7 a\u00f1os mientras dorm\u00eda, un coche se impact\u00f3 con su tienda provocando da\u00f1os materiales por eso decidi\u00f3 protegerlo de esa manera. Con las ganancias obtenidas y el sueldo de su esposo, el se\u00f1or Silverio, dieron estudios a sus hijos y solventaron los gastos del hogar.\n\nMar\u00eda ya ha solicitado otros cr\u00e9ditos a VisionFund, los cuales le han ayudado a mejorar su tienda al invertir en arroz, harina, sopa, frijoles, az\u00facar, leche, at\u00fan, mayonesa, galletas, refrescos, huevos, detergente y as\u00ed ofrecer un amplio surtido de mercanc\u00eda a sus clientes. Sin embargo, tambi\u00e9n su esfuerzo la ha mantenido en la preferencia de los clientes, el lugar se encuentra abierto de las 7 am a las 10 pm, claro est\u00e1 que a partir de las 6 pm cierra su reja y deja la cortina abierta por cuestiones de seguridad.

In the morning, the smoke of the sugar factory is appreciated and several kilometers behind, the Pico de Orizaba, the highest volcano in the country.\r\n\r\nIn one of the town\u2019s neighborhoods, a group formed called \u201cLa Esquina\u201d [The Corner] since the members get together at a corner on the side of the highway.

She is the mother of four children, all of whom are married. For 20 years she has worked selling groceries from her home. In the beginning, the store was enclosed with boards. With the passing of time and the progressive growth of the business, she was able to build a store out of concrete, which she decided to protect with some rails because it is located in front of the highway and on a semi curve. Seven years ago, while she was sleeping, a car hit her store, causing material damage. That is why she decided to protect it in this way. With the obtained earnings and with the salary of her husband, el se\u00f1or Silverio, they paid for their children\u2019s education and covered the expenses of the home. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has already requested other loans from VisionFund, which have helped her to improve her store by investing in rice, flour, soup, beans, sugar, milk, tuna, mayonnaise, cookies, soft drinks, eggs, and detergent, and in that way offer an ample supply of merchandise to her customers. However, her effort has also kept her desired by her customers. The store is open from 7am to 10pm, and of course after 6pm she locks the bars and leaves the curtain open for security reasons. Mar\u00eda needs a new loan to buy more merchandise like eggs, rice, sugar, oil, flour, cheese, and soft drinks to satisfy the needs of her customers who fortunately always pay her when they ask for an advance. \u201cThe best part of my work is that I am at home and I can enjoy more time with my grandchildren.\u201d\r\n\r\n*The photo was taken at the corner of the house where they have their meetings.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

","en":"The name of this young, masterful woman is Saidamoh. She provides sewing services and has 10 years of experience in this field. Even though Saidamoh is 28 years old, she is not married and lives with her mother, father, brothers and sister-in-law. She was 18 years old when she started her sewing business and was able to retain regular customers since then. Saidamoh sews professionally, and her completed orders are very successful.

Of all the activities she involves herself in, poultry farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and feed her animals. She is so close with her animals that she has nicknamed one of them \u201cKoroti,\u201d meaning no feathers on the head. \r\n\r\nMargaret wants to take full advantage of poultry farming as a profitable business venture.

With your loan, Margaret will be able to expand the poultry section on her farm. This will generate enough income to repay the loan, and she will also be able to save extra money. She is very concerned about her children\u2019s education, so profits from farming will go to pay their school fees. Margaret dreams of a secure future for her children.

She has been performing this business for twenty years, and it consists of selling edible products in small quantities, such as rice, beans, sugar, milk, bread, eggs, fruit, vegetables, ice, matches, soap, detergent, etc.  She spends twelve hours each day working in her business to provide good service to her customers.  The purpose of the loan is to invest in working capital and supply her business by purchasing and selling edible products, so that in the near future she can have better income.  Alcira is grateful for the help that Kiva lenders offer to people of low resources and poor countries, like Nicaragua, so that they can have a decent means of work."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350.02,"image":{"id":1758901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The desire to earn more income for her family led her to head a bank for people with businesses to ask for a loan and expand these businesses, which include: machine textile making, crockery sales, technical equipment service, furniture sales, quilt sales, leather wallet making, pastry sales, making skirts and a transport service.\r\n\r\nShe has a travelling sales business which sells seasonal clothing, which she carries out at different festivals and trading spots in the city, exhibiting her products outdoors on coat-hangers. She also sells to office workers and to people whose jobs do not allow them to leave their workplaces. She comments: \" to get customers I walk quite a lot, carrying bags full of clothing. I have regular customers and I also take orders\u2026\u201d. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a chain of clothing shops. She wants to buy clothes from a wholesaler to make the most of the season and use the profits to pay for her children to start school. This is the 2nd loan sequence with the institution in the 14 years that she has been running this business. This is why Elena is asking for a loan to buy clothing from a wholesaler and use the profits to pay for her 3 children to start school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5500,"image":{"id":1758857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes from a wholesaler and use the profits to pay for her 3 children to start school","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":5500,"lender_count":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moises Roger Ju","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Camila Yaly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susy Lupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marco Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deysi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":5500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2293.82},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3021.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3064.88},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3108.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3125.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3221.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3243.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3289.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3336.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3383.55},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3431.71},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3480.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":332},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.38},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":443.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":449.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":452.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":466.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":469.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":476.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":482.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":489.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":496.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":503.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1212.98,"local_amount":8380.57,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":8381.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554397},{"amount":902.34,"local_amount":6234.31,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6234.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226945},{"amount":1411.67,"local_amount":9753.35,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":9754.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214121},{"amount":972.57,"local_amount":6719.62,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":6720.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564247},{"amount":1000.44,"local_amount":6912.15,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6912.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046221}],"funded_date":"2015-01-07T04:21:01Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:10:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jenny Buckland","image":1718323}},{"id":818659,"name":"Naguib","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naguib is 38 years old from Baniswef.

","en":"Rosa was born in the city of Matagalpa in the year 1965. When she was 20 years old, she met Humberto, her spouse. They have been together for 27 years and have had 4 children who are now adults, and she even has the joy of being a grandmother. Rosa and her family currently live in El Sardinal and they have been living in this place for 8 years. Rosa currently has some land where she is has coffee planted, which is producing a harvest. She also grows basic grains primarily for consumption.  She feels good working her plot and growing her coffee. She says that it provides her with cash but that at the same time she has to be very attentive so that it continues providing her with her daily bread each day. In this community of El Sardinal, there isn't electricity; they currently light things with candles and have to have flashlights to go out to the yard at night. For this reason, Rosa asks for a loan to be able to purchase a solar power system. This system will be a great benefit for all the family members who live with her since sometimes her children and grandchildren come and in this way they will be able to use light produced by bulbs, if she is offered this opportunity for a loan to purchase a solar power system.

She carries out her business in the town of Torno, an area home to descendants of immigrants of the ethnicity of places like \u201clos Ayoreos\u201d and miners relocated from the west. It is characterized by its warm, tropical, humid climate with a constant temperature of 30 degrees centigrade during the whole year. \r\n\r\nRosmery has a dark-skinned complexion, long black hair and a short stature. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and the business that she\u2019s in. She lives in her parents\u2019 house, which is made of brick, has potable water, electricity and a sewage system. \r\n\r\nHer business is making and selling bread and traditional baked goods like cu\u00f1ap\u00e9 (a small roll made of yucca flour and cheese), rice empanada (baked with rice and cheese), zonzo (yucca puree mixed with cheese and shaped on a stick to cook in the oven), wheat biscuits (small hard rolls of wheat flour), banana masaco (fried smashed banana mixed with cheese, pork and dried beef).\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was from my mother that I learned my trade and now I administer my business. She taught me all the secrets,\u201d she says. Her dream is to have her own bakery in a fixed place, so that she no longer needs to sell as a street vendor. \r\n\r\nShe wants to grow her business by buying bakery materials like plastic spoons (spoons are needed to mix the flour and yeast); stainless steel bowls for the dough, which are used with lids for sourdough; a dough scraper (vital for removing stuck dough); a precision scale (essential for weighing ingredients in exact measurements and in small quantities); a measuring pitcher (a pitcher with visible marks is very useful for measuring liquids); measuring spoons (to have ingredients with the right measurement); a rolling pin (used to roll out the dough) and others. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan cycle with this institution in five years that is going toward this activity. For these reasons Rosmery requests a loan to purchase bakery materials to make traditional baked goods.

varios a\u00f1os y se apoyan en las situaciones m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles; pertenecen a una comunidad mazahua, a\u00fan conservan su lengua materna, algunas tradiciones y fiestas patronales que surgieron gracias a la religi\u00f3n cristiana.\n\nDo\u00f1a Aurelia es muy platicadora, siempre esta de muy buen humor, tiene 47 a\u00f1os de edad y est\u00e1 casada con Don Felipe quien se dedica a la venta de carnitas; juntos formaron una familia con tres hijas aunque actualmente ya s\u00f3lo una depende de ellos. \n\nAurelia est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo a VisionFund y KIVA para comprar una marrana e iniciar a criar los animalitos porque durante 10 a\u00f1os se ha dedicado a preparar las tradicioneles \"carnitas\" y venderlas en tacos. Aunque anteriormente ella compraba la carne, ahora quisiera encargarse de todo el proceso ella misma para garantizar la calidad de los tacos. \n\nEl primer negocio de Aurelia fue una tienda de abarrotes y aunque todo funcionaba muy bien un d\u00eda simplemente se le ocurri\u00f3 sacrificar un cerdo que compr\u00f3 con sus ahorros, prepar\u00f3 la carne y comenz\u00f3 a vender tacos. \"Ese d\u00eda me fue muy bien, las ganancias fueron mucho mejor de lo que yo esperaba\u201d coment\u00f3. Desde entonces Don Felipe y Aurelia se han dedicado a la compra y venta de cerdos para prepararlos en carnitas, con el tiempo cerraron la tienda de abarrotes, pero el negocio sigue creciendo, actualmente ya son contratados para preparar las carnitas en las fiestas del pueblo. Cada vez que tienen un evento deben trabajar dos d\u00edas continuos para quedar muy bien con sus clientes. \n\nUna de las dificultades que enfrenta Do\u00f1a Aurelia es la distancia que hay entre su casa y el espacio donde conserva a sus animales, tiene que caminar varios kil\u00f3metros para atenderlos y todo el tiempo se preocupa por el bienestar de los mismos. Ella est\u00e1 dispuesta a hacer todo lo posible para mejorar esta situaci\u00f3n y criar a los cerditos porque el m\u00e1s grande de sus anhelos es tener una carnicer\u00eda, ya cuenta con una cortadora y una rebanadora pero a\u00fan le hace falta material. \n\nLas dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Ana Maura quien invertir\u00e1 en herramientas para mec\u00e1nica; Gabriela, en pollos; Julia, en Abarrotes y Karina y Zenaida, en tela para elaboraci\u00f3n de trajes mazahuas.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en las escaleras del quiosco del municipio. En la foto las integrantes muestran algunas servilletas que ellas mismas elaboran para despu\u00e9s venderlas as\u00ed obtener un ingreso extra, Do\u00f1a Virginia es quien viste el su\u00e9ter rosa*\n\n","en":"The members of \u201cGrupo G\u201d are very cheerful women. They have known each other for several years and they support each other in the most difficult times. They belong to a Mazahua community. They still preserve their mother tongue, some traditions and the patron saint festivals that exist thanks to the Christian religion. \r\n\r\nAurelia is very chatty. She is always in a good mood. She is 47 years old and married to Felipe, who sells carnitas. Together they made a family with three daughters although right now only one of them depends on them.  \r\n\r\nAurelia is asking for a loan from VisionFund and KIVA to buy a sow and start to raise the animals. For 10 years she has worked making the traditional \"carnitas\", and selling them in tacos. Although previously she would buy the meat, now she would like to do the whole process herself to guarantee the quality of the tacos. \r\n\r\nThe first business Aurelia had was a general store and although everything worked very well, one day she just decided to slaughter a pig that she bought with her savings. She prepared the meat and started to sell tacos. \"That day it went very well for me. Profits were a lot better that what I expected\u201d, she commented. Since then, Felipe and Aurelia have bought and sold pigs to make carnitas. Over time, they closed the store, but the business kept growing. Right now she has contracts to make carnitas for the town festivals. Every time they have an event they have to work two days straight so they can do right by their customers. \r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties that Aurelia faces is the distance between her house and the place where she keeps her animals. She has to walk several kilometers to take care of them and she is always worried about their well being. She is willing to do everything possible to improve this situation and raise the piglets because her biggest wish is to have a butcher shop. She has a meat cutter and a slicer, but she still lacks some materials.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Ana Maura, who will invest in tools for mechanics; Gabriela, in chickens; Julia, in groceries; and Karina and Zenaida, in fabric to make Mazahuas traditional clothes. \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken on the steps of the town hall. In the photo some napkins are shown that they make themselves to later sell and obtain extra income. Virginia is the one in the pink sweater*\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3075,"image":{"id":1758706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"La Cienega, San Felipe del progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":3075,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.18,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":5512.48},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5783.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6227},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":6372.54},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":6718.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":7015.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":7371.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":376.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":395.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":459.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":503.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":376.69,"local_amount":5512.75,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5548.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980679},{"amount":395.09,"local_amount":5781.83,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5819.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423832},{"amount":425.59,"local_amount":6227.95,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6268.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769163},{"amount":435.46,"local_amount":6372.54,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6414.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649763924},{"amount":459.11,"local_amount":6718.75,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6762.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597477},{"amount":479.37,"local_amount":7015.11,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":7061.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682140887},{"amount":498.51,"local_amount":7371.07,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:55:04Z","rounded_local_amount":7419.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.18,"payment_id":696768076}],"funded_date":"2014-12-29T21:03:22Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T17:55:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":815955,"name":"Cecilia Sebastiana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Grupo de Cr\u00e9dito Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en el sitio C\u00e1rcel Cant\u00f3n Montecristi, conocido por su rica cultura pre colonial y por su artesan\u00eda, que es reconocida a nivel nacional e internacional.

With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Yusuf Dangoma can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. \r\n\r\nWhen asked, Yusuf Dangoma spoke of his ambition to use the additional income to educate his children, eventually hoping to ensure his children are educated and have professional jobs.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1662624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for his children's school fees and uniforms, eliminating pressure to sell corn for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-01-07T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T01:20:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yusuf","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":59905,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":59905}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-08T02:52:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":824528,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":716.67,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy workshop materials for making windows and doors to sell.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":163,"posted_date":"2015-01-07T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T01:20:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":716.67,"local_amount":2000000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2003083.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611880334}],"funded_date":"2015-01-13T19:05:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miranda A","image":984688}},{"id":816972,"name":"Bienvinido","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bienvinido is 58 years old, a married woman with 10 children, two of whom are in school.

She is 41 and a resident of GMA, Cavite, Philippines. Belinda is married to Ramil and has two children. She manages their household while operating a jeepney business. They work hard to provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nBelinda owns and oversees operation of her jeepney. She has one (14-16 person capacity) jeepney. Jeepneys are the most common form of public transport throughout the many islands of the Philippines. Most of the time, the jeepneys are constantly packed with passengers. Jeepneys offer one of the cheapest ways of getting somewhere. They are one of the remnants of the American military presence in the Philippines during the second World War and are still to be seen throughout the Philippines, in many colors and all over the place. Originally, jeepneys were old American jeeps. They were used in the war against the Japanese army who occupied the Philippines for several years. After the Japanese army was defeated and the American military mission was completed, the jeeps were left by the tens of thousands on the islands in the Philippines.The Filipinos saw possibilities to make out of these jeeps. They saw a real means of transportation by making these jeeps about two meters longer and by putting two long seats in them, one on each side from the front to the back. Since then, jeepneys have been used as small buses for cheap transport of people, goods, and even sometimes little animals. Jeepney transport service is one of the stable businesses in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Belinda is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan which she will use for repairs of jeepney's passenger seat and to replace its tires. It is very important that her unit is always in good running condition to ensure efficient service. Her husband drives it, so she is assured that her jeepney is well taken care of. Her earnings from the jeep provide for their daily needs and the school needs of her children. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. \r\n\r\nBelinda hopes that their transport service will continue to be successful. She dreams for her children to get the best education. She prays for the safety of her husband in driving and for a better future for all of them. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1759271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

lenders! Meet Handini, a micro-entrepreneur from Cibubur, a suburban city located at the southern border of Jakarta. Handini is married, and she and her husband have been blessed with two daughters. To support the family income, she helps her husband in running a small stall selling mobile phone airtime credits and utility bill payment services to her community. She met a Ruma field staffer who introduced her to Ruma more than one year ago. She was really excited and decided to try the mobile phone airtime business. <br \/><br \/>For the last three months, Handini has been running the business really well, and now the demand for mobile phone airtime credits is increasing. Therefore, she hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva that will be used to process more mobile phone airtime transactions. This is the second time she applied for a loan from Kiva - the first loan was really helpful in that she now can improve her small stall. <br \/><br \/>Most of her customers are her own female neighbors who have also adopted mobile phones. As the business grows, Handini plans to add more mobile services to her community, such as a utility bill payment service. <br \/><br \/>In the photo, Handini is pictured standing in front of her stall while carrying a bluetooth printer in her hand, which she uses to print transaction receipts for utility bill payments. She thanks you for your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1380964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to process more mobile phone airtime credit sales and bill payment transactions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Cibubur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T01:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T01:40:08Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Handini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":17500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":17500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-18T04:31:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":816676,"name":"Gabriela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gabriela is a brave single mother she has one child he is two years old.

Meet Abdul, a micro-entrepreneur from north of Bogor, a semi-urban area located about two hours drive from Jakarta. Abdul is single and he lives with more than six family members in the family home. \r\n\r\nAbdul runs a small stall and sells snacks, drinks and mobile phone airtime credits. He met a Ruma field staff member who introduced him to Ruma about six months ago. He was really excited and decided to try the mobile phone airtime business. For the last three months, Abdul has been running the business very well and now the demand for mobile phone airtime is increasing. Therefore, he hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva that will be used to process more mobile phone airtime transactions. As the business runs, Abdul plans to add more mobile services to his community, such as e-commerce for low income communities, which is a new service from Ruma that enables people in rural areas to buy products via Ruma agent's small shops, like Abdul's. In the photo, Abdul is pictured standing inside his stall. He thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1760269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to process more mobile airtime and utility bill payment transactions in his community","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bogor Utara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T01:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T01:50:05Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.71,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":7000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":7000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":541.29,"local_amount":7000000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-25T12:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":7069204.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.71,"payment_id":711655417}],"funded_date":"2015-02-05T22:32:54Z","paid_date":"2015-09-25T12:10:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Worth","image":668464}},{"id":817002,"name":"Buntha's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The members of Buntha\u2019s group live in a rural village in Kompomg Thom province in Cambodia.

With this loan, her farm will gain a higher yield and she will be able to sell a variety of vegetables to her respective customers. In these ways, her income will slowly improve and she will be paying her obligations and other household expenses. Lorna will continue support the needs of her growing children, including a quality education.\r\n\r\nLorna would like to improve and expand both businesses to be productive and in this way, she could help alleviate her status of living.
