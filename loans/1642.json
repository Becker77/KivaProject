She makes and sells plaster crafts. She is patient, a good listener and a good mother, enterprising and hard-working. She runs her business in various markets around the city, including the Alasitas market, which has an annual artisan fair. Its known for the sale of miniatures that represent a person's dreams or goals. The Aymara deity Ekeko is the primary focus of the fair. The area has a cold, dry climate with a daytime temperature of 3-15 degrees Celsius year round.\r\n\r\nTeresa has brown skin and long black hair that she wears tied back. Her first language is Aymara and she also speaks Spanish for business, among other things. In the photo, she is the first on the right in the light blue jacket. Her two boys are both in school, and they live in a home they rent. It is made from bricks and has water, electrical, and sewer services. Thanks to her close proximity to the Alasitas fair, she chose to join a bank comprised of people with businesses selling things like perfumes, soft drinks, chickens, empanadas, ice cream, goat meat and one person with a mechanics shop. They are requesting this loan so that they can earn more money to support their families.\r\n\r\nHer business is making and selling crafts made from plaster such as piggy banks, decorations, jewelry, ashtrays, plates, picture frames, and more. She runs the business in set sales locations in different markets around the city. \"The Alasitas festival is coming up and we need to have plenty of product to be ready for it, due to the demand,\" she said. Her business is part of the tradition. The children are very fond of the piggy banks. Many are painted while others have a more natural color. Her dream is to run a stucco plaster sales business. She wants to buy molds so that she can do plaster casting and count on a wide variety of crafts to sell. This is her first loan with the institution in the twenty years she's been running this business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of this is why Teresa is requesting a loan, which she will use to buy plaster molds so that she can sell her crafts at the Alasitas fair."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3950,"image":{"id":1758912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"buy plaster molds to make and sell handicrafts in the Alasitas fair","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":3950,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Duane Josue","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grissel Elizabet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vidalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1804.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2132.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2162.45},{"due_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2193.23},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2224.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2256.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2288.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2320.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2353.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2387.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2421.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2455.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":263.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":311.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325.43},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.06},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":344.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":349.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.23},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":359.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":575.91,"local_amount":3936.57,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3950.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157447},{"amount":637.22,"local_amount":4355.68,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4371.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554400},{"amount":655.49,"local_amount":4480.54,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4496.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226948},{"amount":674.28,"local_amount":4609,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4625.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214123},{"amount":693.6,"local_amount":4741.15,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:29:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4758.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564249},{"amount":713.5,"local_amount":4877.06,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4894.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046222}],"funded_date":"2014-12-29T01:33:16Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:10:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":824585,"name":"Jennifer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jennifer is a married woman with two children.

The fruit is an exotic fruit shaped like a star.  The communal bank members and their businesses are: \r\n\r\nAgustina -Selling Bread\r\nLaura -Selling Bread\r\nMar\u00eda -Raising Pigs\r\nRosal\u00eda -Selling Perfume from Catalogs\r\nAlicia -Selling Vegetables\r\nBlanca -Selling Tupperware and Silver\r\nSusana - Selling Food\r\nGerardo -Selling Pi\u00f1atas\r\nAna -Selling Snacks\r\nOscar \u2013Car Washing Service and Selling Bread \r\nHugo -Cane Harvester Services \r\nKarina -Selling Perfume\r\nIsabel -Selling Snacks\r\n\r\nOscar is married to Teresa, with whom he has an 8-year old son.  He formerly made his living selling tortillas, a business he gave up two years ago to open his own car wash.  He operates it out of a space he has available in his garage.  Oscar got the idea from his father, who has always supported him in everything.  He invested a little money in a compressor, car wash and lubricants.  In addition, from Monday to Sunday, starting at 7:00 pm, he goes out to sell bread on his motorcycle.  He puts a basket of 300 pieces of bread on the motorcycle and sells them in about two hours.  With the earnings from both businesses, Oscar has been able to cover the needs of his household. \r\n\r\nOscar is very satisfied with what he does.  He says, \"If the customers can't bring the car to be washed, with just a call or a message, I go get it myself.\"  For him, the business sells itself, and the effort Oscar has put into it has brought stability to the business.  The loan he is now requesting is so he can purchase shampoo, wax, flannels, corn husk brushes, brushes, sponges and equipment, among other items. \r\n\r\nThe communal bank is grateful for the opportunity to receive a loan, which will be invested in each of the members' businesses.

The group is made up of three women who demonstrate that, as single women, they are able to support their families through their businesses, and with effort, dedication, discipline, and much responsibility, they have been able to support them for many years. \r\n\r\nThis group is coordinated by Florentina, a woman who is a fighter and is very eager to work. For ten years, she has made and sold nacatamales (a typical Nicaraguan dish) in the market of the municipality. This woman, at 50 years of age, demonstrates that work dignifies.

a\u00f1os, entre ellos hay un lazo de amistad muy grande lo que ha resultado en un grupo de pr\u00e9stamo s\u00f3lido. \nAmalia es una mujer amable y trabajadora de 50 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Agust\u00edn quien trabaja como empleado en una gasolinera y tienen tres hijos aunque ya solamente uno depende de ellos.\nDesde hace 8 a\u00f1os Amalia tiene un peque\u00f1o negocio de trastes desechables y pl\u00e1sticos que inici\u00f3 porque ella y Agust\u00edn ten\u00edan un peque\u00f1o ahorro y sab\u00edan que deb\u00edan invertirlo en alguna actividad econ\u00f3mica; se decidieron por este tipo de mercanc\u00eda porque se trata de art\u00edculos no perecederos que pueden conservar por m\u00e1s tiempo.\nAl principio, Amalia ofrec\u00eda los productos de casa en casa con sus vecinos y con sus ganancias pudo rentar un local y m\u00e1s tarde acondicion\u00f3 una parte de su casa para acomodar su mercanc\u00eda. Cada mes, ella viaja a otras ciudades donde encuentra precios muy accesibles para poder comprar en cantidades grandes. Actualmente, do\u00f1a s\u00f3lo le dedica tiempo al negocio por las tardes, ya que por las ma\u00f1anas se encarga de las tareas dom\u00e9sticas, pero no le gustar\u00eda dejar su actividad ya que es una manera de apoyar a su esposo y poder pagar los gastos de la escuela de su hijo a Do\u00f1a Amalia le gustar\u00eda tener m\u00e1s capital para invertir. \nLas dem\u00e1s integrantes tambi\u00e9n se muestran muy contentas y agradecidas con el apoyo de Kiva y VisionFund porque los cr\u00e9ditos les han ayudado a sacar adelante a sus familias e invertir en sus respectivos negocios: Erica y Saturnina invertir\u00e1n en venta de ropa; Jessica, en su herreria; Ofelia, en cerdos y pollos; Ma Felisa, en becerros; Carmen, en su taquer\u00eda; Lidia, en cerdos y Don Jos\u00e9, en colchas. \n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en la casa de Erica y Don Jos\u00e9, se pueden apreciar algunas colchas de las que vende Don Jos\u00e9 y la bicicleta que usa para hacer sus recorridos en las tardes. \n\n\n","en":"The members of the \u201cG\u00e9minis\u201d (Gemini) communal bank have known each other for a number of years.  They have a very strong bond of friendship, which has resulted in a solid communal bank. \r\n<p>\r\nAmalia is a friendly and hard-working woman.  She is 50-years old and married to se\u00f1or Agust\u00edn, who works as an employee at a gas station.  They have three children, only one of whom is still dependent on them. \r\n<p>\r\nFor eight years, Amalia has had a small disposable plates and plastics business.  She started the business because she and Agust\u00edn had a little savings that knew they should invest in a financial activity.  They decided on this type of merchandise because it deals with non-perishable items that can keep for a longer period of time. \r\n<p>\r\nAt first, Amalia sold her products door to door to her neighbors.  With her profit, she was able to rent a store front.  Later, she set up a part of her house to accommodate her merchandise.  Every month Amalia travels to other cities, where she finds affordable prices that allow her to make larger quantity purchases.  Currently, she only dedicates the afternoons to her business, as she spends her mornings taking care of her household chores.  However, she doesn't want to give up her business, as it is a way to help her husband and to pay for her son's educational expenses.  Do\u00f1a Amalia would like to have more capital to invest.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe other communal bank members are also very happy about and grateful for Kiva's and VisionFund's support.  The loans have helped them to get their families ahead and to invest in their respective businesses.  Erica y Saturnina will invest in clothing sales; Jessica in her blacksmith's; Ofelia in pigs and chickens; Ma Felisa in bull calves; Carmen in her taco stand; Lidia in pigs and don Jos\u00e9 in bedspreads. \r\n<p>\r\n*The above photograph was taken at Erica and Don Jos\u00e9's house.  You can see some of the bedspreads that don Jos\u00e9 sells and the bicycle he uses to make his rounds in the afternoons.

He met a Ruma field staffer who introduced him to Ruma about three months ago. He was very excited and decided to become a Ruma agent because he wanted to improve his shop. \r\n<p>\r\nFor the last three months Mardi has been running his business very well, and now the demand for mobile phone airtime is increasing. Therefore, he has applied for a 7,000,000 IDR loan through Ruma that will be used to process more mobile phone airtime transactions. As the business progresses, Mardi plans to provide more mobile services to his community such as e-commerce for low-income communities. \r\n<p>\r\nMardi is pictured above in his shop with his wife.

Some of them spend their time in the fields planting, tending, and harvesting the sugar cane.  Meanwhile, there are others who transport the sugar cane by trucks or carts to the mills where the cane undergoes various processes before it is turned into refined sugar.  <br \/><br \/>There are other residents who are self-employed as a result of starting their own businesses.  Such is the case with the members of the group named \u201cLas Gaviotas\u201d (The Seagulls).  They work hard each day so that they can provide a better quality of life for their families.  The members and their businesses are as follows:<br \/>\u2022 German owns a laundromat.  <br \/>\u2022 Enedina sells food, soft drinks, and perfumes.<br \/>\u2022 Manuel is a Zumba instructor.  <br \/>\u2022 Margarita sells groceries<br \/>\u2022 Mar\u00eda and Esperanza sell food.  <br \/><br \/>Enedina is 32 years old and the mother of two teenagers, a 15-year-old and a 10-year-old.  She and her husband Martin are in a common-law relationship.  Enedina only had the opportunity to study through high school.  For this reason, she wants to continue supporting her children so that they can do better than her.  She believes that the future favors those who are prepared, so her children are her priority.  <br \/><br \/>Fifteen years ago, Enedina began helping her mother sell fast food and soft drinks underneath a thatched roof that was built in the front of their house.  As the years passed, the profit they earned was used to remodel their home.  They renovated the front part and it is still the location where she continues to sell food.  When she opens the metal gate in the mornings, it signals to her customers that the food is ready.  \u201cWhat I enjoy most about selling food is that I can be at home without having to neglect my family.  In addition, I have learned how to work thanks to my mother,\u201d says Enedina.  She always remains active on site as she attends to her customers.  <br \/><br \/>With the intention of improving her business, Enedina is requesting a loan so that she can invest in more supplies for preparing meals such as tomatoes, chili peppers, onions, garlic, cilantro, potatoes, oil, beans, meat, and soft drinks.  Her plans include making renovations to her place so that she can have more space and be able to attend to more customers.  <br \/><br \/>\u201cPutting the loan to good use will make our dreams possible, so we will work until our goals are met,\u201d says Sra. Maria, who is Enedina\u2019s mother.  She is also a member of the group.  <br \/><br \/>*The photo was taken in the small kitchen where Do\u00f1a Maria and Enedina prepare food.  Enedina is seen in the photo wearing a white blouse with black

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI miss my childhood, when I had a full family and we could rest, chat and laugh together. People say that man is given so many tests as one can sustain. In our case, my mother should be so smart and strong person to have a thin time. I had my father, my mother, sister and brother. When I was 4 years old my father died in accident. After 10 years from that tragedy, we learnt out that my brother had a brain cancer and we lost him. There are no words to explain our feelings and grief that time. Still I don\u2019t understand how we could undergo of those events, but three of us: my mother, my sister and I continue to live and hope for the happy future.  \r\n\r\nAt the present my sister is married and lives separately from us. My mother started to be sick often and underwent a surgery in 2012. Now she gets a small pension due to her health and volunteers in Public Ergene Foundation (National Centre of Oncology). She helps morally and physically for all people who have such a disease as hers. She fights against her illness and devotes herself to me. I feel that I am to be a good daughter and take care of my mother too.\r\n\r\nI love to study. I finished one of the best schools in Bishkek and now I am a freshman at AUCA. I took European Studies because I want to learn the languages. The department requires French or German as a second language, and many of the students are also able to spend some time in Europe during their studies. \r\n\r\nI require Kiva loan in order to be able to get a degree, eventually hoping to have professional job and take care of my mother.

Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclables like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries, factories and others of the like. \r\n<p>\r\nIgnacia earns a minimum of 2,500 PHP every day selling to her neighbors and the local community. To help her continue operations, she is applying for a 10,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy materials from recyclables collectors. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business and aims to see it grow in the coming years.\r\n<p>\r\nLocally, all CCT community partners and clients such as Ignacia are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her job is to protect her plants and coffee beans, as well as to maintain the land so that it is well-kept.  She also managed to pay for skilled labor to clear weeds from her property and to buy supplies.

He is a very friendly person who is known throughout the community.\r\n\r\nSantiago's goal is to buy a plot of land since his children are little and he doesn't have to spend a lot of money on them. Santiago needs this loan because he has been offered a plot of land in his own community.

They are on average 50 years old with four children. They all live in Lafiabougou, one of Bamako's neighborhoods. They became acquainted through local tontines (savings groups) and their income-generating activities.\r\n\r\nGroup members are merchants selling clothes, firewood, cosmetics and basin (damask) fabric. To increase their working capital, group members decided to join Soro Yiriwaso about a month ago and are on their third group loan.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ma\u00efmouna (the woman standing in the third position from right to left in the photo) has a great reputation at selling pagne wax clothing (colorful West-African fabric).

She started by cutting hair and little by little learned grooming. Later, when she was nearly an expert, she bought work tools and began to make house calls and to work from home. This entrepreneurial youth of barely 19 years of age has managed to maintain her business and has had it for three years. She offers services in hair dying, blow outs, hair cuts, scalp massages and everything related to hair care. \r\n\r\nHer main customers are her neighbors in the village in which she resides in the city of Soledad. She also has other customers outside of this area who request her services because of the quality and care in her workmanship. She buys her hair cutting materials from specialized providers and makes the payments in cash. She is currently applying for a credikiva, the first loan she is getting from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With this, she will buy hair cutting materials like shampoo, massage products, dye and other products to serve her customers' demands, which increase during the coming season: December, the month of celebrations.

She lives her life to support her five children, unconditionally. The little children are everything to her. Thanks to them, she always has a smile to greet her customers, each of them who buy eggs from her. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and maize. Philis has been relying on agriculture to make all of her income. However, rising costs of farming inputs such as fertilizer and fluctuations in market prices for her products, are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. Despite these tough conditions, Philis remains positive and passionate about her economic activity.\r\n\r\nPhilis is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of her business that is least affected by harsh external conditions. Poultry farming is cheap to run and the demand for chicken products is always high. With this loan, Philis will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profits. An increase in income for her is timely, because it will enable her to tackle high farm-related costs next season. This will greatly improve the quality of work, since the cost of every input will be covered adequately. As a result, she will realize better-quality produce and higher yields. This loan will support economic activity and will improve her family\u2019s living standards.\r\n\r\nYour help will give Philis the opportunity to earn her own sustenance and to dream that she can help her parents cover their family

Meet Rusmaria, one of Ruma agent who lives in Cibubur. Cibubur is a city located at the south of Jakarta. Rusmaria is happily married, and she and her husband have been blessed with two children. Rusmaria has been joining Ruma for more than two years and she is one of the Ruma agents who is continuously showing good improvements in running her business. She puts a Ruma banner in front of her house to tell people in her community that she is a certified Ruma agent who sells mobile phone airtime credits and provides utility bill payment services. She feels glad to become a Ruma agent because she can provide mobile services in her community, thus helping people who experience a lack of access to such services. As the business runs, Rusmaria is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to process more mobile airtime credits and utility bill payments transactions, especially on the weekends. In the photo, Rusmaria is standing in front of her house where she usually serves many transactions from her customers who are mostly her neighbors.

a small plot of land on which to grow her own maize, fruits, vegetables and keep dairy cows. Eunice lives with her family of five in a two-room mud-thatched house in Kiminini, a remote village in the Kitale area of Kenya. Eunice completed her secondary school education, thanks to the financial support and effort of her parents, but she never advanced beyond this. This never killed the spirit she has for succeeding in life. She started farming, and has been farming for the past ten years, and through mixed farming she has been able to take care of her family. She loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of her cows 'Mweusi' (meaning Black). \r\n\r\nAlthough Eunice passionately loves farming, she faces a challenge of water shortages. Most of the rain water goes to waste, which is why she is seeking a loan to buy a water tank. Eunice comes from an area where there is no piped water. Therefore this water tank will help her to harvest water during the rainy seasons and also store water for home consumption.

They are average 39 years old and have five children. They all live in  Minkoungo, one of the neighborhoods in Bamako; they met each other through neighborhood connections and their businesses in Minkoungo. The group members run small businesses in cosmetic products (pommades and perfumes) of different quality, grains (rice), potatoes, and tea. In the goal of augmenting their business funds, the group members decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their second group loan. Mrs. Rokia (the one standing in the photo) has a grand reputation in selling cosmetic products (pommades and perfumes) of different quality; she plans to use her loan to buy 4 boxes of pommades and 4 boxes of perfume at wholesale in Bamako. She sells these for cash or credit in Minkoungo and door to door to a clientele made up of mostly women. Mrs. Rokia hopes to earn with this loan a monthly profit of 30,000 FCFA, which will be used to reinvest into her business and to take care of her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1749935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy cosmetic products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":23.6,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e8bou     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e8bou    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":101515.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595319403},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T13:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":101515.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610753165},{"amount":178.71,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":101515.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.96,"payment_id":624542887},{"amount":181.03,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":101515.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.64,"payment_id":636515904},{"amount":191.66,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-28T12:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":101515.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649788208},{"amount":191.66,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-09T12:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":101515.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":668301010}],"funded_date":"2014-12-23T15:52:14Z","paid_date":"2015-07-09T12:10:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry W.","image":null}},{"id":824668,"name":"Jenny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenny is 26 years old, married, and has two children, one of whom attends school.

Her husband needs to maintain his taxi because the current condition of his taxi so bad that it requires maintenance charges on a daily basis. Due to insufficient financial means he is unable to pay for the maintenance of his taxi. Therefore Nanmun has applied for Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan, Nanmun's husband can afford the maintenance costs easily. This will allow him to provide better transport facilities to earn a profitable income. Nanmun also plans to make savings with the profit amount of her husband's income to meet her family's needs in future.\r\n\r\nNanmun is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC

Some of the most important economic activities in this region are fishing and sugar cane production and for this reason there are two important displays of festivity, one for the sugar cane producers and one for the fishermen. This second one is particularly unique as it takes place at the lake, where the fishermen go out in their boats to the places they usually fish. Motivated by their faith, they ask the Virgin to help them in their work. \r\n\r\nIn this community full of tradition there is a communal loan group called Las Gaviotas [The Seagulls] whose name comes from the happiness that the members feel when they see these birds on the lake, because it means there are lots of fish. The members of this loan group are Lidia, who sells cosmetics; Angela and Blandina, who sell groceries; Juana, who sells food; Clara, Guadalupe, and Antolina, who sell fish; and Mauricia, who sells chicken.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe is known for her smile. She is married to Jose and has been selling mojarra [a fish similar to tilapia] for 28 years, helping to support her husband who has been a fisherman since he was a young man. Every day Guadalupe goes out to sell the fish that her husband catches. He works 24-hour shifts to catch 60 or 70 kilos [130-155 lbs.] of mojarra.\r\n\r\nWith their earnings and with previous loans, Guadalupe and Jose have been able to improve the tools of their trade. They have bought new nets and buckets, wood to repair their two boats, and two motors, and also cover their household expenses. With this new loan they are asking for, they will buy more nets and will repair one of their boats. Guadalupe says \"I will continue to work selling fish until I can't any longer. I like what I do. I have met many people and been to many new places, and it helps me instill in my grandchildren a good work ethic.\"\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken in Angela's store, where every two weeks the members of this loan group meet to pay their loan installments. Guadalupe is the woman dressed in blue.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1756227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy new nets and repair a boat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Cerro Mojarra la Capilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T14:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T14:30:05Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Angela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blandina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mauricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":44000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4400},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4400},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4400},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4400},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4400},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4400},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4400},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4400},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4400},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":4400,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:30:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4427.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595349965},{"amount":600,"local_amount":8800,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":8854.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980686},{"amount":600,"local_amount":8800,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":8854.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423838},{"amount":600,"local_amount":8800,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":8854.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769169},{"amount":900,"local_amount":13200,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":13281.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649763930}],"funded_date":"2014-12-23T20:18:44Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

and Sciences. Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure both of my parents love me and wish to give me everything that they hadn\u2019t themselves. One of the important things in our life is getting a good education, especially a higher education. Because of the lack of higher education, both my parents never had a stable job or stable income. After the collapse of USSR, our country faced economic crisis and all people just sold different stuff at the market. So did my parents. After getting married and having a baby, they also were ready to do any business that required no special skills: cooked somewhere, was a taxi driver, security guard, etc. Most of the time my mother spent at home looking after her children, as the family is the most important thing in this life. \r\n\r\n\"I know that there are a lot of families in Kyrgyzstan that have the same situation as ours. The people, who live day-to-day, and don\u2019t lose a hope of bright future. Nowadays, we have an opportunity to be better, to change our family and country for the better. The solution will be a good education. One can achieve success, if he\/she tries and is not afraid of changes. I went to kindergarten, finished school and now I am a freshman at AUCA. \r\n\r\n\"Since I was 14 years old I dreamed to enter AUCA. AUCA is unique in Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia. A liberal arts model of education truly provides students of the knowledge and skills to compete in a rapidly changing world. At AUCA, we are able to learn in an atmosphere where critical thinking is valued and encouraged. It is exciting to be part of a community where you are challenged to think logically, engage in serious inquiry, and develop effective written and oral communication skills. These skills give us a competitive advantage throughout our professional careers.\r\n\r\n\" This Kiva loan will allow me to pay for my university tuition fee and to continue striving for a better future.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1760633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She is a mother of three children who has been doing farming for the last five years so that she can supplement her income from the salary she gets. Agnes does crop farming and cattle keeping, and she enjoys farming a lot. \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenges are the lack of finances to improve her farming and diseases. This has made her seek a loan of 30,000 Kenyan shillings to purchase a sheep. With this sheep, her projections are that by the end of the year, the sheep will have given birth to at least four other sheep. Through sheep-keeping, she will be able to get sheep wool, which is very expensive and fetches more profits. This translates to more income and improved living conditions for her family. Also, she will be able to sell sheep meat and sheepskin, which will be increasing her income level. The profits will be used to repay the loan on time and grow the business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":279.88,"image":{"id":1760647,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T14:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T14:50:08Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.55,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51.08,"local_amount":4377.9,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4617.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262692},{"amount":45.66,"local_amount":3913.72,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4128.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601046},{"amount":36.01,"local_amount":3086.72,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3255.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459513},{"amount":55.99,"local_amount":4937.38,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5207.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.61,"payment_id":696587598},{"amount":36.11,"local_amount":3212.37,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3388.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.37,"payment_id":731022725},{"amount":50.48,"local_amount":4461.34,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4705.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.57,"payment_id":752110918}],"funded_date":"2014-12-23T17:54:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":817231,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is a 42-year-old single woman with five children living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

She is 57 years old and she resides in Silang Cavite, Philippines. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for 10 years, and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5-pesos-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Ursula would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 10,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Ursula hopes to extend and expand her store. She dreams to give her children a good life by providing all their needs in education.

Because of his parents' economic situation, he had to work to finish his studies, but he was not able to continue in university because he had to work full-time to support his parents and his daughter.\r\nMiguel plants corn, beans, and other basic grains. He is also a day labourer. He learned this work from his father, who taught him this work when he was young. Thanks to this, Miguel is able to support his family. To get to the places where he works, he walks about an hour. When he works close to his home, it takes him half an hour or twenty minutes. As a day labourer Miguel makes little money every day, but it helps him to support his family.\r\nHe needs this loan to repair the roof of his home: to buy tile and wood and to pay the labourers. The roof is in bad condition and when it rains the entire house gets wet.\r\nWith this loan, he will be able to do his work and provide his family with a more secure place to live, without fear that the roof will fall in on them or that they will get wet in the winter.\r\nMiguel plans to join the army in order to help our country to be more secure, and to help his family economically so that they can have what is necessary to live with greater comfort.\r\nHe also wants to be able to build his own home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":173.6,"image":{"id":1759979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to repair the roof of his home: to buy tiles and wood and to pay the labourers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T15:20:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel Angel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":13.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":14.35},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":15.3},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":15.41},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":15.73},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":16.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":17.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":17.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18.35},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":18.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":20.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.3},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.73},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.21},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.35},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.85},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":15.07,"local_amount":15.07,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:25:27Z","rounded_local_amount":15.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769901},{"amount":15.52,"local_amount":15.52,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:07:46Z","rounded_local_amount":15.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833532},{"amount":16.45,"local_amount":16.45,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:02:42Z","rounded_local_amount":16.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636201253},{"amount":15.91,"local_amount":15.91,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:21:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650536995},{"amount":35.53,"local_amount":35.53,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":35.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666802908},{"amount":18.22,"local_amount":18.22,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":18.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683482972},{"amount":18.4,"local_amount":18.4,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":18.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696540548},{"amount":38.5,"local_amount":38.5,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":38.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730974665}],"funded_date":"2014-12-24T06:03:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":824841,"name":"Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Isabel, tiene la edad  de 26 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 soltera, vive con sus hijos los cuales son su mayor prioridad.

filter. The silver nitrate-infused ceramic element removes and destroys bacteria and similar agents of water borne diseases. Ngern's village takes water from relatively shallow wells and from local streams; however, the water from natural sources in her village is dirty and unsuitable for drinking without treatment. Even though some people in the village, including Ngern, are able to buy bottled water, the water filter increases disposable income to users by decreasing the amount of money used to purchase bottled water. Ngern and other filter users also decrease the amount of money spent to boil water by purchasing less charcoal and decreasing the time spent foraging for firewood. Ngern's filter is guaranteed for 2 years, though most users find the filter works from 3-5 years.

The nearby villages also suffer from dirty and unsafe drinking water. Phet is excited that she, like her group members, was able to purchase a water filter. Most families report a threefold reduction in diarrhea after they begin using the filter; this is because the filter removes bacteria and other water borne diseases. Even though some people in the village, including Phet, are able to buy bottled water, the water filter increases disposable income to users by decreasing the amount of money used to purchase bottled water. Phet and other filter users also decrease the amount of money spent to boil water by purchasing less charcoal or wood and decreasing the time spent foraging for firewood. Phet's filter is guaranteed for 2 years, though most users find the filter works from 3-5 years.

They run different businesses, such as transforming African locust tree seeds, like BINTOU, who is the second person standing from the left in the photo. They live in big traditional families in OUELESSEBOUGOU in the prefecture of KATI (in the Koulikoro region, in the republic of Mali). They have been running small businesses for several years and are highly sought after in their business of transforming African locust tree seeds. With the concern of satisfying the growing needs of their clientele, the group members decided to integrate the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso. They are on their second group loan. BINTOU, who is the president of the group, is well known in OUELESSEBOUGOU, and excels in transforming African locust tree beans into soumbala (pounded or ground, cooked, and fermented seeds used in cooking). She plans to use her loan to buy 10 sacks of African locust tree seeds. She stocks up in OUELESSEBOUGOU from wholesalers. She sells her products in BAMAKO by 100-kg bags at retail, for cash or credit, to a mixed clientele. She hopes for a monthly profit of 30,000 FCFA, which will allow her to repay the loan and invest in her business.

Her business is selling second-hand clothing.\r\n\r\nShe is sincere, enterprising, generous, understanding, responsible and hardworking. Her business is located in the \"Plan 3000\" zone, an area characterized by its massive population growth; miners relocated from the western part of the country and ethnic groups such as \"Los Ayoreos\", native of the region, have established themselves. The next generation mostly works in trade and manufacturing. The climate is warm, tropical and humid, with a temperature that varies during the day between 21-35 degrees centigrade. \r\n\r\nJhovana is olive skinned, short, has long black hair she keeps tied up, dark eyes, her native language is Guaran\u00ed, and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for the work she does (she is the third from the left, is wearing a light blue shirt and is hugging 2 children).  She shares her live with her partner, who works in construction, and their four children. The older two go to school and the younger two aren't yet at school age. They live in a rented house that has drinking water, electricity and sewer services. Her desires to better herself and to improve her children's quality of life caused her to organize a communal bank of people with various businesses such as silverware sales, cell phone sales, chicken sales, flower sales, tea service, tailoring shop, and cosmetics sales to expand their businesses. Her business is selling second-hand clothing, which she does as a street vendor in the different fairs and markets in the zone. \"Recycled clothing has begun to be a more popular alternative, without stigma, and is a business that is on the rise for some entrepreneurs...\" she says. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own store in a permanent location to be able to stop being a street vendor. She wants to increase her stock of second-hand clothing, purchasing them in bulk to reduce costs and generate more earnings. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the three years that she has been doing this work. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Jhovana asks for a loan to purchase second-hand clothing in bulk to supply her customers.

This gentleman is only 24 years old. He is married and already has an eight-month-old child. Sohibnazar started to look at life differently after having a child. He found the meaning of life, calling and motivation. Sohibnazar and his brother are involved in repairing houses. Their work is seasonal, and Sohibnazar is left without an income source during the winter periods. He has to provide everything for his family.

Zulkada has a secondary education and very good references from her neighbors. They describe her as a kind and hardworking woman. To provide the primary income for her family, she has been involved in animal husbandry and farming since 1989. Her farm contains 3 cows and 3 horses. Additionally, Kalipa has 5.0 hectares of land, where she grows clover. Thanks to Kalipa's hard work, her business yields about 18,000 som (KGS) per month, which serves as the basis for covering food and household expenses of the family. In order to further develop her business, Kalipa requested a loan in the amount of 20,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy 4 sheep.
