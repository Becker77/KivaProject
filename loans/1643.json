Tony works as a peasant farmer for a living. Where Tony lives, his family and his community do not have access to safe drinking water. The community collects their water from Kawilson well. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. If Rabare C had a way to treat their water, they could improve the health of their community, keeping children at school and parents at work.\n\nThis is why Tony is requesting a loan for a chlorine dispenser on behalf of his community. Tony was elected to represent his community as a volunteer promoter.

Monica wants to be a promoter because she believes that the chlorine enables her community have access to safe water so that there will be a reduction on water-borne diseases and improved health.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Monica\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1764684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To provide communities with free access to chlorine to treat their drinking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolyn ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":73,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-27T15:04:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":820004,"name":"Pamela's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pamela is 36 years old, has 2 children, and lives in Kanguta B village in Ndhiwa sub county, Kenya.

Meet Rose, 45 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Kiminini, a remote village in Kitale. She is happily married and is blessed with eight adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last fifteen years and has gained so much experience. \r\n\r\nTo afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has also been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Kitale area is very populated, and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and so she is seeking a loan of 65,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan and permanently change her living conditions, as well as to secure the future of her school-going children.\r\n\r\nHelp Rose with a loan today!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":259.63,"image":{"id":1788303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-07T16:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T16:50:06Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.59,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1906.49},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1962.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2019.55},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2078.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2139.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2201.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2266.19},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2332.41},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2400.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2470.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2542.94},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2617.26},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2693.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2772.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2853.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2936.89},{"due_date":"2016-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3022.73},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3111.06},{"due_date":"2016-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3201.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3295.56},{"due_date":"2016-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3391.88},{"due_date":"2016-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3491},{"due_date":"2016-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3593.04},{"due_date":"2016-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3698.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.26},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.53},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.18},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.56},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.28},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.36},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.05},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.92},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.76},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.71},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.7},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.71},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.76},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.83},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.94},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.08},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.62,"local_amount":4806.96,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":4857.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824749},{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":4732.38,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4782.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264922},{"amount":53.15,"local_amount":4764.78,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4814.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459559},{"amount":97.49,"local_amount":8972.64,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":9067.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.59,"payment_id":696587644}],"funded_date":"2015-01-27T18:48:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sally Otway","image":1443524}},{"id":824689,"name":"Nongkhun Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vieng's village takes water from wells and from the local streams.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Kamlungo A\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. In Kamlungo A, 25 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Joyce has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are 2 other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Daisy and Kennedy.\n\nKamlungo A village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser.

Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Beatrice\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1764495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To allow the community to treat their water to make it safe to drink using chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T16:50:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T16:50:20Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":73,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-27T03:59:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":819970,"name":"Mary's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is 49 years old, has 6 children, and lives in Kokoth Mangula village in Ndhiwa, Kenya.

The community of Gibarori village collects their drinking water from a local well because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases often making Gibarori\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser program offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination.  Elizabeth  has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves healthy. There are 2 other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Simon and Joab.\n\nElizabeth\u2019s community needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Elizabeth believes that the dispenser will help her community stay healthy. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits.

She is single and doesn't have children. Her business is selling underwear. She is enterprising, independent, active, reliable, responsible, and hardworking. She runs her business in Cotoca, which is a small area located East from the city and well known for its traditional food and crafts, particularly ceramics. The weather is warm, tropical, and humid, and the temperature varies during the day between 21 and 35 degrees Celsius year round.\r\n\r\nGabriela is short and has dark skin, black straight hair, and dark brown eyes. She is standing in the center of the picture, wearing a black top and blue pants. Her first language is Guaran\u00ed, which is spoken locally, and she also speaks Spanish, which she uses generally and while doing business. She lives in her parents' house, which is built out of brick and has running water, sewage, and electricity. Her parents don't work. \r\n\r\nIn order to improve her business, she decided to lead a communal bank with other business owners to request a loan and expand her business. The other members work selling furniture, selling sheets, making purses, selling empanadas, sewing skirts, offering transportation services, and running a video store. Gabriela works selling underwear for women (low-cut and under-wire bras, lace and microfiber thongs, and shape-wear) and men (cotton boxers and socks), as well as baby clothes like onesies, and children's clothing for boys and girls.\r\n\r\n\"The underwear business is quite extensive. It looks simple, but there's lots of variety for both sexes as well as for children,\" she says. Her dream is to have a large and well-stocked store.

The above picture presents Jane, a 38-year-old hardworking, honest, and dedicated farmer. She is based in Kapsowar, Kenya - a remote town with harsh living conditions due to the bad terrain in the region. \r\n\r\nJane is happily married and, together with her husband, has 4 lovely children. Her primary sources of income are milk and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. Jane is a tough woman with tough skin, and she has managed to take care of her family with her income from selling milk. The Kapsowar area has conditions that favor dairy farming, and Jane has always wanted to take care of another dairy cow. But the lack of capital has always prevented her. So today she is seeking a loan to buy this additional cow. \r\n\r\nHowever, the dairy cow she intends to buy is not just any ordinary cow. It\u2019s a breed that produces between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. With this cow, she will be able to produce more milk which will translate into more income. Demand for milk in the Kapsowar area is high, but the supply is low. So, through this loan, Jane is going to reap more and comfortably meet this demand. \r\n\r\nHer increased income will allow Jane to provide a secure future for her school-going children by being able to pay their tuition fees. She believes that education is the gateway to success. \r\n\r\nJane's vision is to keep even more dairy cows so that she will be able to build a bio gas digester, which would help her to save more energy.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":572.49,"image":{"id":1760733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality, exotic breed of dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T17:30:03Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.12,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":68275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4832.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4973.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5118.57},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5268.16},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5422.18},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5580.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5743.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5911.54},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6084.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6262.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6445.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6633.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.35},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.26,"local_amount":10858.66,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:47Z","rounded_local_amount":11143.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264876},{"amount":56.74,"local_amount":4998.28,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5129.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459514},{"amount":122.12,"local_amount":10991.48,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:55Z","rounded_local_amount":11280.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.65,"payment_id":681377924},{"amount":122.51,"local_amount":11435.87,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":11736.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.3,"payment_id":711505902},{"amount":133.74,"local_amount":12149.73,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":12468.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.17,"payment_id":752110919}],"funded_date":"2015-01-01T02:08:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nathan Tichenor","image":28733}},{"id":817280,"name":"Abubakar Aliyu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abubakar Aliyu is a Babban Gona maize farmer.

Meet Mildred. She lives in the Kitale area of Kenya, renowned for being the basket area of Kenya. Mildred is a mother of five, and she has been in an agricultural business for six years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and vegetables. Mildred has been relying on agriculture to make all her income. However, the rising costs of farming inputs, such as fertilizer, and fluctuations in market prices are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. \r\n\r\nDespite these tough conditions, Mildred remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. \r\n\r\nMildred is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of her business least affected by harsh external conditions. A poultry farm is cheaper to run, and the demand for chicken products is always high. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mildred will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profit.

","en":"Victor was born in a place called San Rafael del Norte in 1952. He used to help his mother work in the fields. When he turned nineteen he started working cutting coffee. This was around 1971 or 1972. Then he met Julia and decided to stay and live with her. Eventually, he and Julia had six children, but only four survive today. Victor worked very hard to buy a bit of land, where he grows coffee. He also has an area for basic grains. He harvests his coffee beans alongside his children, and he also goes out to work on nearby farms to make some extra money.\r\n\r\nHe says that life can be quite hard, but that everything turns out well with God's help and it's possible to get ahead. He has worked hard to buy his things and was able to build a house, but the community doesn't currently have electricity and he would like to be able to have an alternative source of light in his home. Currently he is using candles and flashlights. He is requesting a loan so that he can buy a solar panel and bring light and power into his home for his whole family to use.

However, the demand is overwhelming and she wants to increase her poultry, but the biggest challenge is a lack of funds. She is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. Poultry farming has become one of the most important aspects of agriculture in Kenya because it creates business opportunity for entrepreneurs and it\u2019s a kind of business that can never dry up. Poultry farming is a less strenuous activity that is profitable. Many poultry farmers feel a sense of fulfilment from having hens all over their homestead. The hens lay eggs that can be consumed or sold. If taken seriously, poultry farming has the potential of being a big business because the demand for poultry products is always high. With your loan, Dinah is going to make more income that will enable her to take care of her family's expenses. As the times keep getting harder, Dinah is doing all she can do to ensure that her family's basic needs are met."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":371.84,"image":{"id":1788370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-07T18:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T18:10:08Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.18,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.26,"local_amount":6334.29,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6463.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824756},{"amount":35.04,"local_amount":3114.5,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3177.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264926},{"amount":69.73,"local_amount":6198.15,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":6324.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601094},{"amount":73.35,"local_amount":6639.6,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:04Z","rounded_local_amount":6774.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.35,"payment_id":681377973},{"amount":37.28,"local_amount":3499.58,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3570.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.09,"payment_id":711505954},{"amount":79,"local_amount":7266.13,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":7414.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.74,"payment_id":731022769}],"funded_date":"2015-01-09T02:02:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Ingram","image":566975}},{"id":824871,"name":"Julia Teresa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julia tiene un sal\u00f3n de belleza ubicado en la ciudad de Cartagena de Indias, ella inici\u00f3 ofreciendo servicios a domicilio y poco a poco fue creciendo su clientela, entonces sinti\u00f3 la necesidad de empezar a organizarse para abrir un sal\u00f3n de belleza, compro los activos y los instalo en su casa, de esta manera ten\u00eda m\u00e1s tiempo para dedicar a su hogar y a la vez generar recursos.

To support her husband in fulfilling family needs, Sri is managing a small stall which sells mobile phone airtime credits, and utility bill payment service. Sri is the one who manages the stall on the daily basis. She joined Ruma about 1 1\/2 years ago when she met a Ruma field staff member who introduced her to Ruma financial services. For the last three months, Sri has been performing well in providing mobile services in her community. She has an advantage to sell because her customers are mostly her neighbors who regularly come to her stall. As the business runs, she needs more working capital to process more transactions in her stall. Therefore, Sri is applying for a Kiva loan for the first time. In the future, Sri plans to add more products to sell, such as e-commerce for low-income communities. In the photo, Sri is in front of her small stall.

The profits from her business will be used to increase her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nAs of 2009, the agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans. Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village.Taking care of her poultry is an activity that she finds very enjoyable, and feeding her poultry is her hobby. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in the Kapsowar area. Grace has good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market as demand is very high. Being a visionary woman, she has always wanted to increase her poultry farm, so now she is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Accessing financial services for women is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising women like Grace can achieve their dreams and goals. Grace believes that the key to increased egg production is proper feeding and good care. By ensuring that the poultry are fed well, she is guaranteed to reap the benefits. In addition to selling eggs and poultry meat, she will also sell poultry feathers that are commonly used to make earrings. The increased income will be used to improve her living conditions and to repay the loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":164.51,"image":{"id":1760764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T18:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T18:10:09Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.3,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":18.79,"local_amount":1670.54,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1699.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262693},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":1482.17,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1507.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264877},{"amount":16.22,"local_amount":1441.99,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601047},{"amount":17.77,"local_amount":1579.8,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1606.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459515},{"amount":18.02,"local_amount":1636.35,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1664.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.39,"payment_id":681377925},{"amount":17.19,"local_amount":1572.53,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1599.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.5,"payment_id":696587599},{"amount":18.37,"local_amount":1731.1,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1760.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.1,"payment_id":711505903},{"amount":18.49,"local_amount":1705.7,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1734.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.7,"payment_id":731022726},{"amount":19.69,"local_amount":1804.15,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1835.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.61,"payment_id":752110920}],"funded_date":"2014-12-23T19:32:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":817315,"name":"Shaaibu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shaaibu is a maize farmer from Namadi village in Kaduna state.

lenders! Meet Emily, one of the most hardworking women on earth. She is 26 years of age, very hardworking, and a go-getter. She is a proud mother of three lovely children. She hails from Moiben, a remote village in the Kapsowar area of Kenya. This area has harsh weather conditions and to survive, you must have tough skin, but Emily has defied all the odds and has been engaged in farming for the past five years. Her primary sources of income are crops and animal farming. Emily passionately loves farming and has even nicknamed one of her cows \u201cTuyai\u201d (this is from a person\u2019s name), and whenever she is milking her cow, she feels proud. She is contented with the farming way of life. Her biggest challenge in farming is irrigating her farm. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy a generator that she will use in pumping water from the river to her farm. Irrigation is used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and re-vegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall. \r\n\r\nThrough this loan, she will be able to double her crop production, and this will translate to more income. Through the extra income from farming, she will be able to support her family and keep up with her rising family expenses. Emily patiently waits for your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1760812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a generator to be used for irrigation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T18:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T18:20:04Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.8,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.96,"local_amount":3551.9,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3612.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262695},{"amount":63.99,"local_amount":5687.77,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5785.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601049},{"amount":114.25,"local_amount":10760.33,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:53Z","rounded_local_amount":10944.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.8,"payment_id":711505905}],"funded_date":"2014-12-23T23:11:54Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":817325,"name":"Ado Wakili","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ado Wakili is a Babban Gona maize farmer.

major world records. Beatrice is blessed with four children, and has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. On her farm she grows maize, and keeps a dairy cow and poultry. She sells milk, eggs and maize, and when she is not farming, Beatrice offers transportation services to other farmers on her motorcycle. To meet her expenses and provide for her family, she also often engages in small personal business to make extra money. Farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction despite the low earnings. Beatrice said, \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" Her biggest challenge, however, is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. To a farmer, this means  business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Beatrice  formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance organization that supports small rural farmers. She acquired a dairy cow that she named Mrembo (Swahili for beautiful), which produces milk daily that Beatrice sells to a co-operative. \"The money from milk comes regularly and is not really affected by sudden changes in the weather, if you have stored feed,\" said Beatrice. \r\n\r\nThe money Beatrice earned from selling her milk was sufficient to repay her last loan. Now she is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy cow and is planning to become a fully-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. With this loan, Beatrice is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, with good health and a good livelihood. Beatrice is grateful to Kiva and their lenders and promises to repay promptly.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":770.25,"image":{"id":1760789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":25.55,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":68275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4832.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4973.23},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5118.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5268.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5422.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5580.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5743.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5911.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":6084.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6262.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6445.19},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6633.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.06},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.84,"local_amount":5448.27,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5591.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262694},{"amount":57.48,"local_amount":5063.89,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5196.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264878},{"amount":61.08,"local_amount":5380.69,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5521.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601048},{"amount":63.24,"local_amount":5571.19,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5717.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459516},{"amount":63.58,"local_amount":5723.16,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5873.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.38,"payment_id":681377926},{"amount":61.13,"local_amount":5539.1,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5684.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.75,"payment_id":696587600},{"amount":376.35,"local_amount":35130.35,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:53Z","rounded_local_amount":36052.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.42,"payment_id":711505904}],"funded_date":"2014-12-25T16:25:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Henry Goodman","image":null}},{"id":817329,"name":"Tu\u011fba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tu\u011fba is married.

The city is known for its beautiful beaches, which receive many visitors at all times of year. It is also known as a uniquely beautiful city with many tourist attractions. \r\n\r\nThis is a group of people who decided some time ago to join together to form this communal bank, which has helped them greatly to expand their businesses.

She is 30 years old and has a common-law husband. From this relationship she has three children, aged 15, 12 and 7. The younger children are in primary and secondary school. Her husband is a mechanic. \r\n\r\nWith the aim of earning something on her own and helping her household get ahead, Glenda works selling clothing of all types as well as Avon products (beauty products, cosmetics, creams, perfumes and costume jewelry). Her sales method is from door to door, and most of her sales consist of orders. She works three or four days each week on her sales and collections, since she sells on credit and collects payments every fifteen days. She has dedicated herself to this work for more than 10 years, and it helps her earn something for her family's well-being. \r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy more merchandise, such as pants, blouses, shirts, and Avon products. This is her third loan cycle within the communal bank. She is the one who supervises the group's payments, and she likes the group because the loans have helped her greatly with her business. Her dream is to give her children the best she can.\r\n\r\nThe small photo shows a member who was unable to be present when the group photo was taken. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6625,"image":{"id":1760090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy pants, blouses, shirts and Avon products to sell.

Since then, their farm and family have grown in more ways than one. In 2008, the couple started working on a run-down farm. Today, they are making money off the poultry and dairy animals they raise, and also the maize and vegetables they grow. \r\n\r\nCharles has further invested in transportation services to reduce their transportation costs, and make money offering the service to other farmers. Charles loves to dairy farm, especially since it was always a life goal of his to be a farmer. His wife understands this and together they joined hearts and hands to make the farm\u2019s success to date happen. \r\n\r\nCharles is seeking a loan to purchase a pedigree dairy cow. There are more than 100 cattle breeds in Kenya. However, not all are good producers of milk. In fact, very few are. Cattle aside, the tastes and preferences of milk in the market are really growing diverse in Kenya. Taking milk is no longer a matter of pouring it into our cereal bowl, adding it to our coffee, or drinking it straight from the glass; we now have preferences in the type of milk we drink. Today, milk consumers are spoiled for choice: in the market, we have old-fashioned cow\u2019s milk and lactose-free milk, not to mention non-dairy options such as soy, almond, rice, and coconut milk. It takes dairy masters like Charles to pick these shifts in the market and adopt ingenious techniques in farming to ensure that their product qualities adapt to the changes in consumer preference. Purchasing a pedigree cow goes to show how Charles is keen on controlling lameness levels in his dairy cattle. He considers breeding to be the core of his overall strategy of ensuring that milk quantity is way above average and the milk quality is second to none in the market. \r\n\r\nHe anticipates that feeding will be his highest cost of milk production. This, to him, is accepted because to get cows that milk well and remain healthy, they have to be fed properly. Your loan will make a significant difference to Charles's farm profitability. The couple will make use of the returns from this investment to pay for the loan, pay for their children\u2019s education, and the rest will be reinvested in the business. It has always been their ambition to share their passion about farming with their four children. They hope the kids will be thrilled to join the business of running the family farm."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1788450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a pedigree cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-07T18:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T18:50:06Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3733.27},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3842.38},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3954.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4070.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4189.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4311.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4437.63},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4567.32},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4700.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4838.18},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4979.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5125.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":824896,"name":"Angie Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Es un grupo solidario mixto, est\u00e1 conformado por 2 mujeres y un hombre emprendedor (Bielka Victoria, Yaneth y Benjamin), viven en la ciudad de Bilwi; se unieron hace 4 meses con el prop\u00f3sito de trabajar de manera solidaria para poder acceder a pr\u00e9stamos en Pana Pana  para poder tener la oportunidad de mejorar sus peque\u00f1os negocios, mejorar sus ingresos y as\u00ed mejorar la calidad de vida de sus familias.\n\n\nBielka Victoria: Es la coordinadora del grupo solidario, es una mujer luchadora, tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y tiene un hijo de 8 a\u00f1os de edad que cursa su primaria.

She is a smallholder farmer from Sambirir in Kapsowar, Kenya. She is a mother of two: one son and one daughter. \r\n\r\nLike many farmers in the region, she has a dairy cow. Kapsowar has a thriving market for dairy products. Sokome has sustained herself through dairy farming for seven years now. She enjoys the farming lifestyle. She has a connection with farm animals that goes so deep that she even names each of them. \r\n\r\nShe has aspirations of expanding her dairy farm, but due to financial constraints, she has been unable to do so until now. From Kiva lenders, Sokome is borrowing KES 52,750 to purchase a high-yielding dairy cow. This cow will boost milk production on the farm. As a result, she will have more milk for both consumption and sales. \r\n\r\nWith the money from the additional sales, she will be able to service her loan on time. With increased income from the loan, Sokome plans to spend money to settle the high farming cost of production. Many farmers compromise quality because of the high cost of inputs. However, with increased income, Sokome will not have to take such measures. \r\n\r\nIn the long run, her family will realize an improved standard of living. Sokome is happy for Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva for the support.

Her method of sales is door-to-door and she also sells from her house where her most known customers come. She works three days a week, but above all in the mornings, since at this time she takes advantage of her children being at school, and it is easier to go out to sell her clothing. She leaves the items on credit and collects every weekend.

","en":"Don Toribio was born in a community called El Sardinal in the year 1967.  All his life, Toribio has lived in this community.  He lived with his parents until the age of 9.  At that age his father died, so from then on he grew up with his paternal grandparents.  He lived with them until the age of 23.  During the time that he lived with his grandparents he learned to work in farming.  At age 23 he met Juana and got married to her; they have three children.  \r\n\r\nWith effort and hard work he managed to buy some land where he has coffee planted.  He harvests it with his children, as well as planting basic staples on his land.  He says that in life it\u2019s necessary to work hard in order to get things but the best way is to earn your things with the sweat of your brow, which is to say by working hard.  \r\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t electricity in his community, and he says that this is pretty hard.  It is because of this that he has always wanted to buy a solar panel.  He hasn\u2019t been able to because he has invested in his home, which he now has finished.  So Toribio is asking for a loan to buy a solar power system.  This will be a huge help, because his children are in school and the light will allow them to study at night and do their homework.  The lady of the house gets up in the morning to prepare food when they leave to work early, and he states that it will be a great advantage.  He would be very grateful if given the opportunity of this loan to buy a solar power system."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1760098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy a solar power system","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":279,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T19:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T19:10:10Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Toribio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":522.75,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":237.61},{"due_date":"2016-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":285.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":238.63},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":286.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-24T15:18:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":808494,"name":"Hadija","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hadija is a married woman with five children, all of whom attend school.

Segundo worked in a auto repair shop as a master mechanic's assistant, and now he has his own workshop.  That was how he got started learning the trade that he likes so much.  He then took some courses to become a professional mechanic.  His profession has been helping him to get ahead for a long time and to be able to support his household.  Segundo's wife is proud to have him, a hard-working and very responsible person who works every day to give Mar\u00eda and their children everything they need, by her side.  Mar\u00eda and Segundo have two beautiful children who fill their parents with joy as they play around the house. \r\nSegundo makes his living in auto-body work and painting.  His wife earns her living in agriculture and raising animals in their home.  The area they live in is well-known for these businesses.  Mar\u00eda learned the trade from her parents at a very young age.  She works six or seven hours a day with her husband's help.  The most difficult part of her business is the physical effort it requires. \r\nSegundo's greatest hope is to see his children grow with health and to have good careers. \r\nSegundo needs to purchase livestock for his wife's business, which is why he came to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to request a loan.  The loan will help their sales to increase, as they have in the last months.  That is why Segundo has made his need known to us at Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa.  He thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Ecuador and Kiva for it making it possible for him to grow personally and with his family.

with three children. She has a calm and optimistic personality. To support her family, she raises livestock. Rahat started in 2006 with 4,000 KGS and now has three cows, two horses, and 30 sheep. She makes 3,000 monthly from her livestock business, and also works  as an archivist, making around 10,400 KGS. This income is really inadequate to support Rahat and her children. \r\n\r\nTo grow her business, Rahat took a loan from micro-finance bank, Bai-Tushum, for 125,000 KGS to buy cows and sheep to increase her herd. She plans to use the income from this loan to further develop her business and save money for her children's education.

Su vida la realiza con su pareja que se dedica al transporte libre y con sus hijos; el mayor estudia en la escuela, los menores todav\u00eda est\u00e1n al cuidado de su madre. Los deseos por mejorar la calidad de vida de su familia la llevaron a conformar una banca de personas con negocios como; venta de s\u00e1ndwiches, artesan\u00eda, venta de refrescos, librer\u00eda, venta de ropa, venta de fruta y venta de tomates, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y ampliar sus negocios.

She works as a manicurist.  Virginia is a good mother with a positive attitude.  She is also enterprising, optimistic, cheerful, generous, friendly, responsible, and hardworking.  <br \/><br \/>She conducts business in the town of El Torno, a rural area that is known for its agriculture trade involving meat, vegetables, and grains.  Rural producers and distributors from the city gather together so that they can buy and sell.  This area has a tropical, warm, and humid climate.  The air temperature can vary throughout the day between 21 to 35 degrees centigrade.  <br \/><br \/>Virginia has a dark complexion, long black hair, and a short stature.  Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, but she speaks Spanish as part of the general culture and for engaging in trade.  In the photo she standing in the middle, wearing a yellow top and blue track pants.  Her life with her partner involves moving around freely and being with her children.  Her oldest child is in school while the younger ones are being cared for by her mother.  <br \/><br \/>Virginia wanted to improve her family\u2019s quality of life, so she started a Communal Bank with other business people who sell sandwiches, make handicrafts, sell soft drinks, manage a bookstore, sell clothes, sell fruit, and sell tomatoes.  As a result, they are able to request a loan so that they can expand their businesses.  <br \/><br \/>Virginia\u2019s business is working as a manicurist.  She keeps herself busy by taking care of and embellishing the hands, specifically giving attention to the nails and painting them.  Virginia works at an aesthetician\u2019s center in the mornings and at a beauty salon in the afternoons and evenings.  Her duties include cutting, cleaning, and filing the nails of her clients, both on the hands and feet.  The first thing she does is remove the old nail polish with acetone.  She then trims and files the nails by using clippers and an emery board.  In order to soften her client\u2019s cuticles, she soaks them in a mixture of oil and water.  To clean rough patches, she re-trims those areas by using pushers and special scissors.  <br \/><br \/>Virginia works Tuesday through Sunday at both locations.  \u201cHow we take care of our hands says a lot about ourselves.  The impression left by clean hands, well-trimmed nails, and a good coat of polish is difficult to overlook,\u201d she says.  Her dream is to become independent and open her own nail salon.  She wants to become independent because she can attend to more clients and become her own boss.  For this reason, she is seeking to buy emery boards, nail brushes, wooden cuticle pushers, cuticle nippers and pliers, a nail polisher, pumice stones, chairs, hand soaking receptacles, a heating element for warming oil, small cushions on which clients can rest their arms, and other supplies.  This is her first loan cycle with Emprender.  <br \/><br \/>Virginia has been in this line of work for 10 years.  For the many reasons that have been mentioned, she is requesting a loan so that she can open her nail salon, become independent, and attend to her many clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1750958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies and equipment so that she can open her nail salon, become independent, and attend to her many clients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ximena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristhian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":910.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":923.72},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":936.86},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":950.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":963.72},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":977.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":991.35},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1005.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1019.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1034.29},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1049.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1063.94},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1079.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1094.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.26},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.18},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.14},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.13},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.79},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":686.06,"local_amount":4685.25,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4740.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554354},{"amount":288.29,"local_amount":1968.79,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1992.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226892},{"amount":296.55,"local_amount":2025.24,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2049.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214068},{"amount":305.05,"local_amount":2083.3,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2107.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564196},{"amount":474.05,"local_amount":3237.42,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3275.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046173}],"funded_date":"2015-01-27T14:42:53Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:09:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":817437,"name":"Bashiran","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bashiran is a 50-year-old vigorous, married woman.

His wife withdrew from him as well, which made going through the long treatment even more difficult. The borrower was unemployed, about to lose his family and was borrowing from a small convenience store across the road in order to eat.

After he successfully completed it, he applied to the organization\u2019s Income Generation project with a project for footwear sewing. He had an industrial shoe sewing machine which was no longer working so he received support to purchase a new motor and resume his activities. Presently, he is working consistently from home, is in good health and has recovered his relationship with his family. As demands for his products are growing, he has decided to expand his business by buying a new shoe sewing machine.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.
