He is a 4-year-old married man with seven children and nine dependents. The dependents are his brother's children, who died in a motor accident. \n\nHe is a farmer and  sells agricultural products. He requested 1,000,000 UGX to  buy  manure and fertilizers for his coffee plantation in order to increase yield.

The community of Osogo village collects their drinking water from Ngarabach borehole  because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Osogo\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. In Osogo, 28 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Peter has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy.

The community of Nyaigutu B village collects their drinking water from a local well because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases often making Nyaigutu B\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser program offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. Robert has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are 2 other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Christine and Joseph. \n\nNyaigutu B community needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser.

She has 10 years of experience in farming. \r\n\r\nSelina is seeking a loan to expand her horticulture farm. She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output. \r\n\r\nLoans for smallholder farmers with little irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations, such as Juhudi Kilimo, support farmers like Selina. Through a group of 10 members called Kaimuge self-help group, Selina has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. \r\n\r\nAccording to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholder farmers, both unskilled and semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Selina, because the institution believes that women too are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural

She got involved in animal husbandry and farming three years ago, starting this business with a purchase of two sheep. Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Ainura achieved good results and today has 1 cow and 10 sheep on her farm. She grows barley for sale on 1.20 hectares of leased land. In order to increase her livestock headcount, Ainura requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy sheep.

He has a tire repair business.\r\n\r\nHe is entrepreneurial, generous, understanding, patient, responsible, and hardworking. He carries out his work in an area called \u201ccruce villa Adela,\u201d which is a central location known for connecting various areas of the city through public transportation. From this location, one can get transportation to faraway areas of El Alto. The area has a cold, dry climate and a constant temperature between 4-12\u00baC (39-54\u00baF) all year. The area is at an altitude of 3800 meters above sea level.\r\n\r\nJesus has dark skin, short black hair, a short stature, a slender physique, and dark eyes. His native language is Aymar\u00e1, which is what his family speaks, but for business he speaks Spanish. He shares his life with his partner, who takes care of their baby and also helps with the business, and with his small child who already can walk. They live in a rented house that is made of adobe and has electricity, potable water, gas, and plumbing. He has a tire repair business. He changes the tires of all kinds of vehicles such as automobiles, minibuses, buses, trucks, etc. He also patches flat tires and puts air in tires. He carries out his work every day of the week in his workshop, which is located in his home.  \r\n\r\n\u201cI started my work as an assistant to a tire-repairman. Later, my son was born and I had to become independent\u2026\u201d he comments. His dream is to expand his workshop and do oil changes. He hopes to invest in his business by buying an air compressor to inflate tires. Since the one he uses is currently broken, he is losing customers. This is the first loan he requests from the institution in the 2 years that he has been working in this occupation independently. \r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Jesus is requesting a loan to buy an air compression machine to inflate tires and continue his work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1761138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy an air compression machine to inflate tires and continue his work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-23T23:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-06T23:40:07Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesus Genaro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":445.07},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":428.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":426.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":479.43},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":470.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":493.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":501.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":519.62},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":528.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":553.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":568.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":585.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.91},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.64},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.07},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.9},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":127.41,"local_amount":873.67,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":880.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554410},{"amount":747.59,"local_amount":5126.33,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:17:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5165.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226959}],"funded_date":"2015-01-31T04:01:44Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T11:17:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cristina Bleicher","image":1721919}},{"id":817543,"name":"Sandy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sandy is originally from the Dominican Republic and has lived in the U.S. since 1999.

village in Ndhiwa, Kenya with his family which includes 3 children. The community of Nyamwa C village collects their drinking water from Agutu stream because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Nyamwa C\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. In Nyamwa C, 20 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Michael has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are 2 other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Rebecca and Ann.\n\nNyamwa C village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser.

In addition to LP gas, he used to buy important amounts of wood to cook, and heat water in the bathroom. Not only was this contributing to deforestation, but also burning wood was filling the house with toxic smoke, which the whole family was inhaling on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nWith his biodigester, Marcos will turn his animals' manure into a precious resource to produce his own biogas, which will supply the house and farm in a renewable and safe energy source to cook and heat water. The animals' manure is also transformed into a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer by the bacteria inside the biodigester, which Marcos will spread on his cornfield to improve the yield in a natural way. By displacing LP gas, wood and chemical fertilizers, Marcos will save money he plans to reinvest in the purchase of additional animals, and the improvement of his farm's infrastructure, to create better living conditions for his animals.\r\n\r\nThis loan represents 45% of the total cost of the biodigester, the remaining part being covered by a government subsidy.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":169.3,"image":{"id":1788114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"to purchase an 8 m3 Sistema Biobolsa biodigester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huamantla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":226,"posted_date":"2015-01-08T00:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T00:50:16Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.71,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":12921,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":12921}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":168.59,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2519.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.71,"payment_id":731164607}],"funded_date":"2015-01-17T22:00:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":825034,"name":"Marilou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilou is 39 years old and married with five children.

Indeed, the natural methanisation process taking place inside the biodigester, as well as the bacteria in the system, will treat and transform waste into renewable energy connected to the house and nutrient-rich organic fertilizer for the field. Felipe will reduce his operating costs and protect the environment by limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the contamination of underground water sources by the manure and reducing his dependency on fossil fuels. There will be no swarms of flies around his farm anymore, nor bad smells, thus progressively turning his farm into a comfortable and sustainable place to live.\r\n\r\nFelipe is requesting a loan to purchase a 10 m3 Sistema Biobolsa biodigester.

From an earlier age, he started working in agriculture with his father.  He is now married, having decided at the age of 24 to start a family.  His wife devotes herself to housework and caring for their children.  He works selling sweet bread and french bread.  He has worked in this business for five years, and he has learned the ins and outs of the business through time.  A friend of Geovany's is who got him the job because the bakery was in need of another salesperson, and he took advantage of the opportunity.  Previously, he worked as a farmer.  He does not have any other jobs. \r\n\r\nOn average, he travels about 30 kilometers during the work day.

This area is like many others in that it sits at the foot of a hill, which is why it can be said that the houses are hanging one above the other (at least this is the appearance it has from the center of the city).  Only cars with a lot of power dare to reach the top because from below it is impossible.  The inhabitants will always have to go by foot in order to get to houses in the neighborhood.  \r\n\r\nArmando has a dark complexion, a short stature, and short dark hair.  His mother language is the Aymar\u00e1 that his family speaks, but for work he speaks Spanish.  He shares his life with his wife who makes a living in the same business.  Their daughters are in school, and they all live in their own home, which is built from brick and adobe, and has potable water, electricity, and a sewage system.  His business is making covers for vehicles of all kinds and to measure.  The materials he uses are nylon, canvas, and imitation leather among others.\r\n\r\nHis previous work was in carpentry, but due to the sawdust his lungs got infected and he had to change jobs. \"My advantage is that with the high quality of my work I have constant customers from transportation unions and various radio taxi lines,\" he says.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to have a much larger workshop and to make covers for seats and other things. He hopes to realize the expansion of his business through the refurbishment of a room in order to install a new sewing workshop. This is his first sequence of loans with the institution in the seven years he has been doing this business. \r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Armando is asking for a loan to refurbish a room in order to install a new sewing workshop."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1761078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to refurbish a room in order to install a new sewing workshop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-24T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Armando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":227.58},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":472.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":454.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":479.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":484.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":503.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":507.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":538.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":551.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":563.07},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":586.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":601.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":623.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.13},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.56},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.28},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.81},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.7},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":824974,"name":"Juana Norma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Norma es una se\u00f1ora que por muchos a\u00f1os a impartido clases de educacion primaria , con 56 de edad,y 36 a\u00f1os de impartir clases,  mostrando buenas relaciones con los ni\u00f1os y compa\u00f1eros de trabajo, es casada con 3 hijos los cuales ya son independiente, es casada.

This group was formed in Nov. 2014 with the purpose of raising the income level of their families by development of their existing small enterprises. The featured member, Jajnaseni, is one of them. She is 33 and standing in the middle raising her hand in the photo. She lives with her husband and two sons. Boith her sons are attending school.\r\n \r\nJajnaseni has been maintaining her family by doing a small business of making sweets and selling them with the help of her husband for the last 15 years. She especially makes a locally popular sweet named \u201cKhudma\u201d (fried dough dipped in sugar syrup). Her husband supplies the product in the local market with his moped every day to the wholesalers as per their orders. She also supplies sweets for social functions in their village as per the order of the customer. Jajnaseni and her husband cook for six hours in an open fire every day making 50-60 kg of sweets with a daily expenditure of Rs 2,500\/-. From this business, she earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR, which is not enough to meet the regular expenses and to think of the future. She says that the prices of raw materials are changing very frequently and that she has been a victim of the price rise many times due to her frequent replenishment cycle. To safeguard from price fluctuation, the present loan will be used by Jajnaseni to buy raw materials like dough, oil, sugar, and firewood in bulk and store them. This will also help her to save the repeated transportation and purchasing costs. Jajnaseni dreams of repairing her old house with an extension and giving a better education to her children. So she and her husband are working very hard to save money to materialize their cherished dream. The other nine members of the group also have small enterprises like selling sweet items, tailoring, running a Tiffin stall, repairing bikes and cultivating vegetables.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1761328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase raw materials like dough, oil, sugar, and firewood in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dumerbahal,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-12-24T02:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T02:40:03Z","loan_amount":3050,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bhanumati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hemalata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jajnaseni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khir ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Parameshwari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rajanirani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Remati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subhadra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Subhagya Manjari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":192000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":192000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":817722,"name":"Flordeliz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flordeliz is 48 years old and married with five children, one of whom is in school.

She has a grown-up son and a three year old grandchild. Darihan has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, she works with field crop cultivation and livestock breeding, after having started this business in 2010. \r\n\r\nThanks to Darihan's persistent, purposeful and hard work, she currently has 10 sheep and a plot of land of 0.45 hectares, where she grows wheat and sweet corn. The monthly income from the business is around 5,000 som (KGS). Catastrophically, this money is not enough for a decent life and raising her grandchild. \r\n\r\nTherefore Darihan turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 15,000 som (KGS) to purchase potato seeds and mineral fertilizers. Darihan intends to spend the income from the loan on education for her beloved

He is a resident of a neighborhood located in the city of Barranquilla. He started his business of renting chairs, tables, and tablecloths in the year 2004. \r\n\r\nHis business idea arose from a need to generate income because he found himself unemployed. He decided initially to buy some chairs; with the profits, he acquired a few tables and tablecloths. That's how he expanded his services to offer them for celebrations. His main customers are schools, event halls, and residents of the area and of nearby neighborhoods; he offers them his service on weekends and holidays. This business maintains a good cash flow. \r\n\r\nCurrently, he is applying for a Kiva loan, his first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo.

years old, married and the mother of two children of school age. As a main source of income for her family, she has worked with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started this business with a sum of 1,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nMaripa currently has three cows, three horses and 20 sheep on her farm. She also has 1.0 hectares of own land, where she grows garlic and wheat to sell.

She is independent, enterprising, a good mother, steady, responsible and hardworking. Her business is  located in the community of 'Higachi' characterized by its proximity to the sacred Lake Titicaca.  This is an agricultural area where cattle are raised as well as sheep.  People also make their living from fishing and planting, such as quinoa, potato flour, bean, potato, etc.   The area is known for its cold weather, with temperatures ranging daytime 1-12 degrees Celsius and where the sunshine is also strong.\r\n\r\nAlicia is dark-complected, with long braided black hair.  Her dress is traditional (hat, blanket and skirt),  Her native tongue is Aymara  though she speaks Spanish in the workplace. Her life is shared with her younger son who works in agriculture because the rest of her children are independent. They live in a house built of adobe with a thatched roof.  It has electricity and well water.  Her business is the manufacture and sale of artisan cheese.  She is in charge of producing milk based on the output of the dairy farm, and hopes to produce between 4 and 6 liters of milk per cow per day, depending on the breed.  At its inception entire production was destined for the sale of fresh milk, then she perfected her process for making cheese. \r\n\r\nThe sale (of cheese) is made at the markets in the community, Saturdays, from 4 in the morning, and during the week, she sells door-to-door in her community and to visitors and tourists. \"The most common problem we face is the shortage of milk especially in winter.  This makes the price of cheese rise because milk is scarce ...\" she says.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to have a large and sturdy stable to carry out their work smoothly. She wants to make the purchase of dairy cows to increase their milk production and improve the production of cheese. This is the 3rd round of loans with the institution in the 16 years that she has been engaged in this activity independently.  It is for these reasons that Alicia is requesting a loan for the purchase of dairy cattle to increase their cheese production.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":542.53,"image":{"id":1761214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

His business is tailoring.\r\n\r\nHe is independent, persevering, active, responsible, and hardworking. He runs his business in the town of Batallas, which is known for its proximity to sacred Lake Titicaca. It's an agricultural area where livestock are raised (cattle, sheep, and camelids). People live off of fishing and also the local vegetables, like quinoa, potato flour, broad beans, potatoes, etc. The town is known for its cold climate, with daytime temperatures ranging from 2 to 12 degrees Celsius and intense rays of sunshine striking its surface.\r\n\r\nPedro has brown skin, short black hair, medium stature, and brown eyes; his mother tongue is Aymara and he speaks Spanish for business. He shares his life with his wife, who works in the same business, and his son, who is studying agriculture in a technical school. They live in a house built of adobe that has drinkable water, electricity, and sewer service. \r\n\r\nIn his tailoring business, he custom matches his creativity and experience to his clients' needs. He has spent the last twenty years among cloth, linen, needles, and patterns. He makes pants and jackets to order and he also alters all types of garments according to his clients' wishes, aware of the importance of dressing well. He enjoys his work so much that he even feels like a designer, making creative suggestions to his clients about the clothing that they might wear. \r\n\r\nHe has a cutting table, where he begins the adventure.

Al iniciar su actividad no ten\u00eda en mente nada m\u00e1s que ayudar a su esposo con los gastos de la casa, adem\u00e1s de que le gusta sentirse \u00fatil y productiva. \n\nDo\u00f1a Luc\u00eda se levanta desde las 5 de la ma\u00f1ana para preparar, primeramente el lonche de su esposo y despu\u00e9s los antojitos que vende. El saz\u00f3n de su comida, el trato a los clientes, en su mayor\u00eda estudiantes, y los precios son los factores que han permitido que su negocio contin\u00fae adelante. \n\nLuc\u00eda ha utilizado sus ganancias y los pr\u00e9stamos anteriores para comprar los ingredientes y materiales que m\u00e1s utiliza en su negocio y as\u00ed tener la posibilidad de seguir trabajando. En esta ocasi\u00f3n necesita comprar platos desechables, aceite, papel de estraza, carne y una nevera para que la comida se conserve caliente. M\u00e1s adelante le gustar\u00eda invertir en un peque\u00f1o techo para poder colocarlo en el lugar donde vende y protegerse del sol. \n\nSu  principal reto ha sido conservar los clientes, continuar vendiendo como hasta ahorita lo ha hecho.\n\n\"En una ocasi\u00f3n al pasarle el plato de comida a un alumno el plato se cayo y la comida cayo sobre mi, los j\u00f3venes no dejaban de re\u00edr, Pedir y fiar arruinan la amistad pues hay quienes le pidieron en su momento comida fiada y ahora no le hablan\"\n\nEl grupo agradece a cada una de las personas que han hecho posible se les otorgue un pr\u00e9stamo para invertirlo en sus actividades y prosperar d\u00eda a d\u00eda.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue capturada en el parque del municipio al que pertenece la comunidad, las clientas quisieron salir cerca del \u00e1rbol de navidad.

","en":"From the road that leads to the town, surrounded by sugar cane, one sees a pleasing landscape\u2014but once harvest time begins, the houses are revealed.  The group, No Me Olvides [Forget Me Not] was created here. It comprises Julia, who sells chickens; Lucia and Mena, who sell antojitos (traditional corn-based dishes); Aurelia, who sells soft drinks; Gregorio, who sells pizza and footwear; Lorena and Sara, who sell sweets; Maura, who sells hot dogs; and Marina, who sells groceries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Lucia is 48 years old, and she studied until the 5th year of primary school.  She is married to Jes\u00fas, and currently only one child depends upon them.  Three years ago, Do\u00f1a Lucia started selling antojitos (empanadas, fried tacos, and tortillas), fried pork rinds, and peanuts. She sells them outside a school Monday through Friday, and on weekends, at the playing field where the local people go to have fun playing baseball or soccer.  When she started out, she had nothing more in mind than helping her husband with the household expenses.  Also, she liked feeling useful and productive.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Lucia gets up at 5 in the morning. First, she makes her husband\u2019s lunch, and then she makes the antojitos that she will sell. The flavor of her food, the way she treats her customers\u2014primarily students\u2014and her prices, are the things that have allowed her business to grow.\r\n\r\nLucia has used her earnings and the previous loans to purchase the ingredients and materials that she uses the most in her business, thus making it possible to continue working.  On this occasion she needs to purchase disposable plates, oil, brown paper, meat, and a cooler to keep the food hot.  In the future, she would like to invest in a small canopy that she could place where she sells her food, so that she can protect herself from the sun.\r\n\r\nHer principal challenge has been to keep her customers and to continue making sales, and so far she has done so.  She relates that on one occasion, a plate of food dropped and spilled on her when she was passing it to a student, and the kids couldn\u2019t stop laughing.  She also says that requesting and giving credit can ruin a friendship, as some people have asked for food on credit at the time, and now they don\u2019t speak to her.\r\n\r\nThe group thanks every person who has made it possible for them to receive a loan, so that they can invest it in their occupations and prosper day by day.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken in the community\u2019s municipal park, as the group wanted to be near the Christmas tree.  Do\u00f1a Lucia is wearing a black skirt and a pink blouse.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1756238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase disposable plates, oil, brown paper, meat, and a cooler.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COMUNIDAD BALSA LARGA, TEZONAPA VERACRUZ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-24T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T04:00:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregorio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lorena Ezlizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mena Ignacia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":3625,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3649.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595349966},{"amount":500,"local_amount":7250,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":7299.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980687},{"amount":500,"local_amount":7250,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":7299.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423839},{"amount":500,"local_amount":7250,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":7299.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769170},{"amount":250,"local_amount":3625,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3649.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649763931}],"funded_date":"2014-12-24T18:34:46Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanora Brennan","image":null}},{"id":817653,"name":"Divinas Y Famosas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco de emprendimiento DIVINAS Y FAMOSAS est\u00e1 compuesta por ocho integrantes de las cuales seis son mujeres y dos varones, todas ellas se dedican a distintas actividades como; tapizado de veh\u00edculos, venta de jugos batidos, venta de cubiertas de celulares,  venta de jugo, venta de perfumes, venta de refrescos y venta de ropa, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y ampliar sus negocios todas ellas se conocen entre si ya que viven por la misma zona.\nLa presidenta del banco es la se\u00f1ora Ana (en la foto la de solera rosada) es una mujer de 24 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su pareja, tiene cuatro hijos de 8 gemelos, 5 y 3  a\u00f1os, y su actividad es la venta de comida.\nElla es independiente, trabajadora, buena madre, emprendedora, y muy responsable.

She has the equivalent of a high school education with vocational training, and earns her living baking and selling flatbread.  Anarkan bakes it herself, and her daughter-in-law sells it at a marketplace.  She has her own tandoori oven at home, and brings it up to heat with her brother's help.  Her whole family is glad to help her run the business.  Thanks to Anarkan's persistent efforts, her monthly income is currently around 33,000 som.  \r\n\r\nHer family does what it can to bring in money, but their income is far too low to provide a decent standard of living.  To further develop and expand her business, Anarkan has requested a loan of 100,000 som from Bai Tushum Bank to buy flour and charcoal for baking flatbread.  She uses charcoal instead of wood for baking as she cares about the environment.  Anarkan is the leader of the Marat group, which has two other members aside from her.  She plans on using her business' income to expand further, with the goal of eventually saving up enough to build a new, large bakery.

She is a good mother, is enterprising, independent, responsible, and hard-working. Her business is done in the Pampa Chililaya community, which is known for being a rural area dedicated to livestock, for having a cold and dry climate, and a temperature that varies during the day from 2-14 degrees centigrade. \r\n\r\nVictoria has dark skin and long, black, braided hair.  Her mother language is Aymar\u00e1 but she speaks Spanish for general use and for the work she does.  Her life is shared with her family. She lives in a brick house that has potable water and electricity. Her business is weaving blankets by hand and by machine.  Her blankets are well sought after by women in town for protection from the cold and as part of their traditional dress. This is work that she does every day of the week, independently in her home. She carries out the sales in a makeshift stall in the street, as well as at the fair and markets as a street vendor. \"The wool products are much needed in the city because it is cold all year long,\" she says.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a permanent stall for sales so she can stop walking. She wishes to make an investment in her business through the purchase of wholesale wool for weaving and producing her blankets faster and in larger quantities.  This is the first loan sequence with the institution that she has had in the six years she has been doing this work.  For these reasons, Victoria asks for a loan to buy wholesale wool for weaving and increasing her

Her business involves selling traditional food.  She is generous, understanding, a good listener, supportive, strong, a good mother, responsible, and hardworking.  Cinthia conducts her business in the District of Villa F\u00e1tima, a place that is known for the informal fruit trade that takes place in the northern part of the city.  People living in the north have access to public transportation because of the various stops.  The weather is cold and gusty because of the icy winds that come from the mountains.  This area likes 3,600 meters above sea level.  <br \/><br \/>Cinthia has an olive complexion, brown hair, and a medium stature.  Her native language is Aymar\u00e1, but she no longer uses it.  Instead, she speaks Spanish so that she can integrate into the general culture and conduct business.  In the photo, Cinthia is standing second to the left, wearing a white shirt with horizontal stripes.  She shares her life with her son, who is attending school and also taking guitar lessons.  They live in a rented brick house that receives running water, electricity, and sewage services.  In order to expand her business, Cinthia formed a Communal Bank with other businesspeople who sell sweaters, sell construction materials, knit baby clothes, sell potato chips, sell sportswear, manage a neighborhood store, operate a butcher shop, and sell sandwiches.  Joining together allows them to request a loan so that they can improve their businesses.  <br \/><br \/>Cinthia\u2019s business involves selling the traditional food of La Paz such as \u201cchairo\u201d (mutton stew with dried potatoes, carrots, onions, corn, herbs, black mint, oregano, and salt to taste), \u201cplato pace\u00f1o\u201d (a combination of corn, potatoes, beans, and cheese, served with a spicy sauce), \u201cjakhonta\u201d (beef chunks, potatoes, cabbage leaves, and onions), and \u201cpicana\u201d (lamb, beef, and chicken with carrots, turnips, raisins, potatoes, and corn).  She sells her food from the doorstep of her house and out in the open.  Cinthia works every day of the week during the lunch hour.  \u201cI learned to cook as part of a family tradition.

It gathers women who became acquainted through kinship and neighborhood ties. They are on average 31 years old, married with four children.\r\n\r\nThey carry out different activities such as trading clothes like Awa, the first person standing from right to left in the photo. They live in large traditional families in Tiele, in the prefecture of Kati (Koulikoro Region, Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nThey have been in business for several years and are in high demand for their clothes-trading activities: bales of used clothing, pagnes (colorful West-African fabric) and wax (a high-quality type of pagne fabric).\r\n\r\nTo satisfy the growing demand of their customers, group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program four years ago.

The above picture presents to you Jane, who lives in the Thika area of Kenya, also known as the Home of Champions because of producing so many elite runners who have broken so many world records. Jane is the mother of three lovely children and has been doing farming for the past 20 years. Through dairy farming and poultry keeping, she has been able to produce milk and eggs. Jane is a very dedicated farmer who has a never-say-die attitude and enjoys every bit of farming because, through farming, she is able to take care of her family\u2019s needs and wants. Although she experiences challenges in farming, her attitude keeps her going. Enjoying what she does, she has even nicknamed her cow \u201cBlacky.\u201d Jane is seeking a 40,000 KES loan to buy a chaff cutter. A chaff cutter is a mechanical device that is used to cut hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forage. This assists the animal in digestion and prevents the animal from rejecting any part of the food. With the loan, she will be able to increase her milk productivity and increase her income levels, hence reducing the poverty level that is currently facing her.

He only reached second grade in the Bocaysito school and worked in potato farming.  Then his parents moved to Sardinal and he went with his parents.  Evelio received from his father land with a coffee plantation which he has worked on with much effort and dedication.  He has bought more land near where he lives.  He decided to build a house where he lives with Tania.  He says the house is a gift from God and he is very grateful to have a home and food on the table every day.   \r\n\r\nEvelio also knows how to drive and he is sought in coffee harvest season to drive a truck to earn a few cents.  There is no electricity in Sardinal, so Evelio is requesting a loan to buy a solar energy system so he can have electricity at home.  When he harvests the coffee his wife must get up early to prepare breakfast and she now uses a headlight.  At night they light three candles for light which is dangerous and could cause a fire.  Evelio would be grateful for a loan to buy the solar system which would be of great value to the house and very useful."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":113.12,"image":{"id":1761276,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy a solar system.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":279,"posted_date":"2014-12-24T07:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T07:10:09Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evelio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":522.75,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":112.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":123.9},{"due_date":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":136.29},{"due_date":"2016-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":149.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.43},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":113.12,"local_amount":112.64,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:44:14Z","rounded_local_amount":113.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649742280}],"funded_date":"2014-12-25T22:28:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":810502,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":316.67,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"buy clothing and shoes","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-12-24T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T07:20:01Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.56,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":297.11,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:46:20Z","rounded_local_amount":168782.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.56,"payment_id":624542910}],"funded_date":"2015-01-22T05:03:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":817813,"name":"Hafeezan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hafeezan is the age of 39, living with her four children in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

Su negocio lo realiza en la localidad de \u2018Pampa Chililaya\u2019 a una altura de 3735 metros sobre el nivel del mar, distante a 65 kil\u00f3metros de la ciudad de la paz.\nCarmela es de tez morena, cabello negro largo trenzado, estatura mediana, ojos obscuros, su forma de vestir es tradicional (manta y pollera), su lengua natal es el aymara y utiliza el espa\u00f1ol para el comercio. Su rutina comienza desde muy tempranas horas de la madrugada, diariamente lucha para sacar sus productos frescos a la calle, son muchos los gastos que tiene que hacer para llegar al producto final. El proceso comienza con la leche reci\u00e9n orde\u00f1ada, los envases para almacenar el queso se elaboran con materiales de Totora, propia del lugar. \u201cEste trabajo nos da para vivir honradamente y sin lujos. Con lo que ganamos pagamos las cuentas, compramos comida y seguimos trabajando \u201d, comenta Carmela.\nEl principal problema de Carmela es la poca producci\u00f3n de leche, la \u00e9poca lluviosa fue muy corta y no ayud\u00f3 a que aumentara el pasto para alimentar a las ovejas y vacas. Esto repercuti\u00f3 de manera directa en la obtenci\u00f3n de la leche, la provisi\u00f3n diaria es insuficiente para aumentar la producci\u00f3n de queso, dependiendo de la \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o, el pasto desmejora y esto merma la producci\u00f3n de leche.\nEs por esos motivos que Carmela solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de vacas lecheras como tambien ovejas, aumentar la producci\u00f3n de queso y mejorar su calidad de vida.\n","en":"Carmela, age 53, is married and has a 21 year old son. She is in the business of making and selling cheese. Carmela is a hard-working woman: simple, humble, honest, early-rising, punctual, enterprising, and hard fighting. She runs her business in an area called Pampa Chililaya, some 3735 meters above sea level and about 65 km from the city of La Paz.\n\nCarmela has dark skin, a long black braid, a medium build, and dark eyes. She dresses in traditional style with a shawl and full skirt. Her birth language is Aymara and she also speaks Spanish for business. She begins her daily routine at the earliest hours of dawn.\n\nShe struggles every day to bring her fresh products to the street. There are many expenses involved in bringing her final product to market. The process begins with the fresh milk. The packages to store the cheese are made with material from materials native to Totora. \"This work allows us to live honorably and without luxury. With what we earn, we can pay the bills, buy food, and keep working.\" said Carmela.\n\nCarmela's main problem is low milk production.

Seven years ago, she began acquiring land in order to grow a variety of vegetables. She chose farming because she already had experience of it from her parents. When she got married, she stopped farming, but in recent years, seeing the need to increase their earnings, she began growing crops again.\r\n\r\nSabina has managed to apply for various loans, so she is aware of the repayment system.

She is a mother of four and has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. On her farm, she grows maize and keeps dairy cows and poultry. She sells milk, eggs, and maize. When she is not farming, Magdaline offers transportation services to other farmers on her motorcycle. To meet her expenses and provide the best for her parents, she often engages in small personal businesses to make extra money. But farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction despite meager earnings. \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs,\" said Magdaline. Her biggest challenge is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. To a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Magdaline formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance organization that supports small rural farmers. She acquired a dairy cow that she later named Mrembo (Swahili for beautiful) that produces milk daily, which Magdaline then sells to a co-operative. \"The money from the milk comes regularly and is not very affected by sudden changes in weather if you have stored feed,\" said Magdaline. The money Magdaline got from selling the milk was adequate to repay a loan. Today, Magdaline is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy cow and is planning to become a fully-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. With this loan, Magdaline is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, good health, and a good livelihood."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1761480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-24T10:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T10:30:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.25,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magdaline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":68275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4832.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4973.23},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5118.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5268.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5422.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5580.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5743.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5911.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":6084.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6262.18},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6445.13},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6633.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.06},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.84,"local_amount":5448.27,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5591.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262698},{"amount":57.48,"local_amount":5063.89,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5196.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264881},{"amount":61.08,"local_amount":5380.69,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5521.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601052},{"amount":62.1,"local_amount":5471.19,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5614.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459518},{"amount":62.45,"local_amount":5620.43,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5767.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.35,"payment_id":681377927},{"amount":139.39,"local_amount":12632.39,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":12964.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4,"payment_id":696587603},{"amount":313.41,"local_amount":28658.14,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":29410.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.9,"payment_id":731022729}],"funded_date":"2014-12-26T02:31:35Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":817819,"name":"Mariyam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariyam is a 40-year-old housewife.

He remembers that during that time, he was only at school on Sundays and the other days of the week he helped his father on the farm and that is how he learnt to do farm work. \r\n\r\nAngel has worked with his father and had also worked in other places. His father gave him a plot of land and he has also been able to buy more land, on which he has planted in coffee and also staple grains. Currently Angel Michael is in a relationship with a girl whose name is Yobileth. They have been together for 4 years and have a daughter who is two years old. With a lot of effort he has set up house where he lives with his family and he has his land which he farms and makes a living. In the community where Angel lives there is no electricity and he mentions that it is very difficult to get electricity there.  \r\n\r\nThis is his reason for requesting a loan, to buy a solar system and thus be able to have electricity in their home. The solar panels would be of great benefit for all the members of his family and some family members who visit him. He gives thanks to God who gave him life and his daughter. Angel remarks that he would be very grateful if they would give him the opportunity to take out this loan to buy this solar system."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1761284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

Jos\u00e9 tiene planeado construir una bodega para almacenar el alimento de sus animales, por el momento \u00fanicamente utilizar\u00e1 algunas l\u00e1minas de acero, sin embargo espera reunir todo el capital necesario con las ganancias de la tienda y tambi\u00e9n le encantar\u00eda construir otros corrales para comprar m\u00e1s cerditos. Su sue\u00f1o es establilizar ambos negocios para dejar de solicitar pr\u00e9stamos en un futuro.\n\nLos integrantes del grupo y Don Jos\u00e9 est\u00e1n muy agradecidos con VisionFund y KIVA por el apoyo recibido porque poco a poco han mejorado sus negocios. Catalina e Isidra invertir\u00e1n en dulces y refrescos y Mar\u00eda de la Luz invertir\u00e1 en una peque\u00f1a tienda de abarrotes.\n\n*La foto fue tomada en la tienda de abarrotes de Don Jos\u00e9*\n","en":"Previously, in the community where the Loma Chiquita [Little Hill] group members met, you could admire the magnificent first rays of sunlight from a hill with a view, and from that they named their communal bank.\r\n\r\nJose is a very serious person, he is 55 years old and never married. Most of his life has been dedicated to the countryside so he really knows how to grow the region's best corn. He also raises and fattens animals. Currently he has some pigs which are growing fast. His most important business is a grocery store which he opened six years ago with a small saving of 8,000 pesos ($550 US) with which he could buy detergents, oils, drinks, canned goods, etc. At that time he didn't have any shelves so he put some boxes and a table out to accommodate his little merchandise. \r\n\r\nJose gets his merchandise in the town centre and travels by pickup to transport it all, as he always buys all sorts of products so his clients can quickly find everything they need and they don't have to travel into town or shop at another establishment. This effort has made Jose his customers' choice and they are satisfied with his service. The only difficulty he faces at the moment is the lack of a bigger refrigerator where he can keep more products. With the new loan he will buy sweets, snacks, soft drinks, dairy products, canned goods, etc.\r\n\r\n\"With the profits from the store I could raise my numbers of pigs, I've got 30 now and when I sell them there will be good profits.\". Jose plans to build a hold to store animal feed, at the moment he just uses a few sheets of metal, nevertheless he hopes to get the necessary funds for it from the shop and he would also like to build more pens to buy more pigs. His dream is to establish both businesses in order to stop requesting loans in the future.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group and Jose are very grateful to VisionFund and KIVA for the support received because bit by bit, they have improved their businesses. Catalina and Isidra will purchase sweets and drinks and Maria de la Luis will purchase a small grocery store.\r\n\r\n*This photo was taken in Jose's grocery store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4425,"image":{"id":1754611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy sweets, snacks, soft drinks, dairy products, canned goods, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tres Estrellas, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-24T13:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T13:00:09Z","loan_amount":4425,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isidra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda De La Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":9439.15},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":9939.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10699.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11032},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":11657.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12233.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":642.59},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":676.62},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":728.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":751.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":793.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":832.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":642.59,"local_amount":9439.15,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":9465.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980676},{"amount":676.62,"local_amount":9939.03,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:10Z","rounded_local_amount":9966.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423829},{"amount":772.86,"local_amount":11352.76,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:41Z","rounded_local_amount":11384.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769160},{"amount":753.38,"local_amount":11066.67,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":11097.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649763922},{"amount":795.98,"local_amount":11692.32,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:24:31Z","rounded_local_amount":11724.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597476},{"amount":783.57,"local_amount":11510.07,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":11541.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682140886}],"funded_date":"2015-01-07T00:28:40Z","paid_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joelle Kuiper","image":1765797}},{"id":817821,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda is 61 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by farming sugarcane in the Philippines.
