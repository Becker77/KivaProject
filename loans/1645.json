She is based in Koibatek village in the North Rift region of Kenya. Her upbringing was difficult. She never managed to finish her primary education, but she is very determined to give the best life to her children. Fifteen years ago, Rose started farming on her husband's two-acre farm. She did it mostly for subsistence until recently. She now keeps a dairy cow that gives her ten litres of milk to sell every day. She also grows vegetables that she uses to prepare food and also to sell. Rose is seeking a loan to buy another dairy cow, which will produce additional milk she can sell. This investment will not only double the income that Rose is making from milk, but will also mitigate risks associated with having just one productive cow. The additional income will enable her to comfortably handle her family's food and education costs, which happen to be her highest expenses. Please consider providing a loan to Rose to help her improve her economic activity. \r\nSupport this mother who does the impossible to support her children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":341.5,"image":{"id":1761486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-24T13:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T13:20:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.1,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":42400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3000.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3088.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3178.73},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3271.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3367.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3465.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3671.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3778.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3888.89},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4002.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4119.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.41,"local_amount":6463.24,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":6546.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264882},{"amount":77.92,"local_amount":6955.72,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":7045.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459519},{"amount":67.38,"local_amount":6187.03,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6266.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.93,"payment_id":696587604},{"amount":73.37,"local_amount":6798.24,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6885.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.79,"payment_id":731022730},{"amount":44.32,"local_amount":4079.28,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4131.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.38,"payment_id":752110923}],"funded_date":"2014-12-24T15:51:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Seiji Humphries","image":null}},{"id":817828,"name":"Ana Norma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana Norma is 49 years old and a married woman with two children.

Her business is the production of handmade cheese. Her business is located in the Cullucachi community which is known for being located near the sacred lake Titicaca, an agricultural area where cattle, sheep and camelids are raised; people live off fishing and also local farm produce such as quinoa, chu\u00f1o [freeze-dried potato], beans, potatoes, etc. It is known for its cold climate with a temperature that varies during the day of between 1-12 degrees centigrade and where the sun's rays hit the surface strongly.\r\n\r\nJuana has a dark complexion, long braided hair, short stature, wears traditional clothing (hat, shawl and pollera skirt), her mother tongue is Aymara which she speaks locally, but to do business in the city she speaks Spanish. Her life is shared with her husband who works in farming. Her children are grown up and live elsewhere. Her house is adobe [mud brick] and has a thatched roof, she has electricity and water from a well.\r\n\r\nHer business is making and selling handmade cheese; the variety of cheese most produced and consumed in the zone is fresh cheese, which in practical terms, can be divided into uncooked and cooked, and this is where we first find the peasant curds, obtained from pasteurising milk, then made from the curds and their salty and moulded coagulum; or the fresh cheese, double dream or chaque\u00f1o cheese [a semi-hard, ripened cheese made from whole cow\u2019s milk]. In the second case, after obtaining the curd it is heated which can be in a metal pot, where the curd is heated dry, boiled in water or whey, depending on the type of processing,\r\n\r\n\"My job takes a lot of passion, we always search for a way to be constantly improving our processes...\", she says.\r\n\r\nShe also works in sales; she transports the cheese she has produced in a basket to the cemetery of a neighbouring city, approximately two hours journey, and she sits on the ground near the entrance of the cemetery and opens her basket so that within four hours she has sold all of her cheese.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a large barn that contains all the amenities for cheese production. She wants to buy dairy cattle to increase production and generate better income. This is her 2nd loan cycle with the institution in the 11 years she has been working this sector.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Juana is requesting a loan to buy a dairy cow to increase her cheese production and with the profits improve her

Thomas is a friendly member of the community with 5 children.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their drinking water to make it safe to drink. Thomas\u2019s community using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nThomas has volunteered to be the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Thomas volunteered to be the promoter because through the use of chlorine dispenser the community members will be able to lead a healthy life because chlorine kills bacteria in water.

The community of Gwitonyi Kugitimo village collects their drinking water from a local well because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases often making Gwitonyi Kugitimo\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser program offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. Gwitonyi Kugitimo community will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. John has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their drinking water to keep themselves and their families healthy. There is another volunteer promoter from the surrounding community who is part of this group loan called Teresia.\n\nGwitonyi Kugitimo community needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. John believes that chroline kills germs and bacteria in water and make it safe to drink. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that John's community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1762351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To provide communities with free access to chlorine to treat their drinking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2014-12-24T14:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T14:40:13Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":73,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-27T12:31:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":817847,"name":"Sajida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sajida is the age of 30 years.

Kenya. Manyonyi village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a borehole. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Everline and her family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nEverline is a business owner, but has also volunteered her time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables her community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Everline and 3 other promoters in her community, Hellen, Mary, and John, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Everline will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Everline wants to be a promoter because she believes that the chlorine will kill bacteria in water and make the water safe for drinking.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Everline\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1762359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative

The crowd in town likes his garment collection and selection a lot. The demand for clothing has increased due to attractive designs and colors. He can afford all the household expenses from his earnings and saves a portion for his savings, as well. \r\n\r\nHe wants to increase the variety of clothing on a daily basis; this is the reason Nasreen has requested a loan, so that her son can buy more variety of garments to fulfill the demand.

He manages his household necessities from his earnings from milk sales.  He speaks with a monotonous tone which is impressive and he easily wins the trust of his clients.\r\n\r\nHe was in need of one buffalo to increase his income through his milk sale business, so Kousar demanded a loan.

life*. She is a loving mum to three angel-looking children and has been farming for the past 10 years. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, maize, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Rebecca is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. \r\n\r\nAlthough she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Kapsowar area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Rebecca could increase her income and satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Rebecca, but she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Rebecca believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable a permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Rebecca to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going age children.\r\n\r\nAll that Rebecca awaits is your kindness\r\n\r\n* For years rural women have lived poor lives due to disinheritance, patriarchal systems and lack of mentors. In addition, in some parts of Kenya like Kapsowar, more women were rendered poor by the clashes that followed disputed presidential elections of 2007. Their men were killed and property destroyed leaving women who were once financially stable, and even of middle income bracket, vulnerable to poverty. Years later, Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance institution that concentrates on small holder farmers, came to their rescue, training marginalized women from rural areas on how to do agriculture better, advertise and sell their farm produce directly to the market.

During the whole of his childhood he lived with his mother and father, who are no longer living, although he thinks about them often. \r\n\r\nDon Domingo was not able to study as a child. He says that during that time it was quite difficult to study. He remembers that during the war in Nicaragua he had to hide himself and sleep in the fields outside his house, because during the night people would come to recruit young men from their houses. On one occaision they caught him and he had to go along with them. Don Domingo thanks God that nothing bad happened to him during those difficult times but he remembers having to help injured and, at times, lifeless comrades. \r\n\r\nLater, after the war had finished, he began to earn a living growing coffee on some land that his father had left him before he died, as well as on another piece of land that he bought. He harvests the coffee with his family. He also says that, as God gives him the strength to work, he and his family help to harvest coffee crops on neighbouring farms too. \r\n\r\nDomingo says that life is difficult but with the help of God everything turns out all right. Don Domingo was able to build his house with a lot of effort and he feels good with his family. In his community there aren't electric lights, and so he is asking for a loan in order to buy a solar energy system. If he receives the loan, he will install the system in his home and it will be of great benefit to all of his family, especially as his daughter is a student and so needs to have light at night in order to do her work.

Over the years, she has gained much experience and is now considered one of the best farmers in her village because of the immense knowledge that she possesses. Fancy passionately loves dairy farming and she has even nicknamed one of her cows. Since she has excess dairy food and enough space on her land, Fancy has always wanted to buy another dairy cow, but the challenge that she has been facing is lack of finances. That is why Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women like Fancy to turn their dreams into reality. \r\n\r\nFancy believes that the loan will help her to satisfy the milk demand in her area and, through the accumulated profits, she will be able to realize her dream of developing her business into a large enterprise. Many women in Kenya are responsible for not only producing food, but also feeding their family. Fancy, being a hardworking farmer, wants to provide all of the basic needs that her children and parents require. Fancy is very disciplined with her finances and she knows that with the accumulated profits, she will be able to fully repay her

She carries out her business at the San Luis market and the \"July 16th\" one, which are known for informal sales in all areas, where they say one can find everything from a sewing needle to a tractor for plowing.  The climate is cold and dry (2\u00baC -12\u00baC), and the area is located at an average altitude of 34800 meters above sea level.\r\n\r\nAteliana has brown skin and long black hair worn in braids; her dress is traditional (hat, blanket and gathered skirt).  Her native language is  Aymar\u00e1 and she speaks Spanish as a matter of general knowledge and for the business she carries out.  (Seated in the middle of the group, she is wearing a pink blouse, yellow skirt and hat).  She shares life with her husband who is a salesman and with her younger son who is in school.  Her daughter is older, married, and lives separately.  The family lives in a rented house built of adobe which has running water, electricity, gas  and a sewer system.\r\n\r\nHer desire to help pay for her daughter's school costs made her become leader of a group of people with sales activitiey such as selling empanadas, cosmetics, seasonal clothing, dishes, cellphones, the meat from chickens, furniture, quilts, making leather wallets, selling pastries and making skirts,  The group members wanted to get a loan and improve their businesses.  Ateliana's business is weaving vicu\u00f1a wool in a factory.  She weaves blankets and fabric to sell in various markets in her city.  She does the weaving at the factory and it is done by placing the wool in line and adjusting each strand by the pressure of a comb.\r\n\r\nAteliana does this work all day to prepare her woven goods for sale in the market.  \"My factory is an inheritance from a family member, who also inherited it from another; it is worn out and old but that does not change the quality of the weaving,\" she says.  Atelian's dream is to have a large weaving workshop with new looms.  This is the first cycle of loans with the institution in the fifteen years that she has been carrying out this work independently.   \r\n\r\n These are the reasons why Ateliana is asking for a loan to renovate a room to use as a workshop and to weave many blankets of vicu\u00f1a wool.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5800,"image":{"id":1761956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to renovate a room in order to use it as a workshop and weave many blankets from vicu\u00f1a wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-24T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":5800,"lender_count":116,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ateliana Placid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorenza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela Karen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":5800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2320},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1740},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1740}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2320,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":16030.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214150},{"amount":1740,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":12022.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046247},{"amount":1740,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":12022.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554339}],"funded_date":"2014-12-26T17:58:12Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:40:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Heatherly","image":1523379}},{"id":825127,"name":"Jovy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jovy is 46 years old and married to a carpenter.

Meet Teresia. Teresia, 62, is a very dedicated mother who believes in hard work. She is happily married and blessed with four lovely children whom she often refers to as \u201cmy pride.\u201d She is based in Kapsowar, a small remote rural town in Kenya that has bad terrain and is characterized by drought and bad weather conditions. \r\n\r\nFor the past twenty years, Teresia has been actively involved in mixed farming. Her primary source of income is from milk and crop farming. Teresia passionately loves dairy farming and has nicknamed one of her cows \u201cKapseret.\u201d Milking Kapseret is her hobby and feeding her cows makes her very proud. Dairy farming is very fulfilling for Teresia. \r\n\r\nAlthough this humble mom makes a living through selling milk, she faces the challenge of irrigating her farm and providing water to her animals. Kapsowar is a remote area without piped water or electricity. Since Teresia is from a marginalized community, she is forced to walk long distances to search for water. She typically walks for two hours. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Teresia is requesting a loan to buy a water tank. Most of the rain water in her area goes to waste, and Teresia wants to harvest the water and store it in a water tank. The loan will save Teresia time and allow her to irrigate her farm during dry seasons and increase her productivity. The increase in productivity will translate into more income, which will provide Teresia with financial security. Teresia will also use the stored water for home consumption. \r\n\r\nTeresia's dream is to increase her farming activities and provide her children with a proper education. Education is the only way that her children, who are from a marginalized community, can succeed."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":214.48,"image":{"id":1761569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a water tank","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-24T17:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T17:40:11Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.91,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1759.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1811.26},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1864.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1918.68},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1974.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2032.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2091.86},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2153},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2215.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2280.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2347.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2415.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2486.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2559.21},{"due_date":"2016-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2634},{"due_date":"2016-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2710.98},{"due_date":"2016-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2790.21},{"due_date":"2016-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2871.75},{"due_date":"2016-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2955.68},{"due_date":"2016-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3042.06},{"due_date":"2016-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3130.96},{"due_date":"2016-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3222.46},{"due_date":"2016-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3316.68},{"due_date":"2017-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3413.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.38},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.97},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.41},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.18},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.79},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.63},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.39},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.31},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.25},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.22},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.22},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.31},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.51,"local_amount":3867.95,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3934.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262702},{"amount":66.51,"local_amount":5911.83,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":6012.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601056},{"amount":101.55,"local_amount":9285.11,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":9443.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.91,"payment_id":696587607}],"funded_date":"2014-12-25T14:14:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dara Olmsted Silverstein","image":973449}},{"id":817910,"name":"Armen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Armen lives with his family in Tsovagyugh, a village in the Gegharkunik region of Armenia.

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are several reasons of my applying for a Kiva loan: The first and main reason is the lack of money.  I live with my mother and little sister.  My parents divorced many years ago and we don\u2019t keep in touch with my father.  My mother is a teacher at school and my sister attends kindergarten.  My mother\u2019s salary is not enough to cover our daily necessities even though she earns additional money selling the goods of \u201cOriflame\u201d company.  So, my mother is not able to pay for my tuition fees at AUCA for which I kindly ask you to support me.\r\n\r\nI was an active and diligent student at school.  Although I couldn\u2019t afford English courses myself, I tried to find courses or lectures for free.  So in 2012 I was on the list of 29 students, who won a micro scholarship from the ACCESS program and learned English free of charge for two years.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 I was lucky to win AUCA\u2019s full scholarship for the one-year-study program at New Generation Academy.  This time I was among the 70 students, who had a chance to live in the dormitory and to receive a monthly stipend.  The New Generation Academy aims to prepare its graduates for university education.  The program seeks to fill the gaps in the public school system to help high school graduates enter a university of their choice.\r\n\r\nThe second reason for my applying to Kiva is responsibility, which makes me extremely hard-working and cheerful.  The Kiva loan will help me to concentrate just on my studies, and achieve my desired academic and professional purpose.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1761586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

In the beginning he bought one young steer and a pair of rams and then gradually developed his business to the point where he currently has more than 10 head of full-grown steers. He is the only breadwinner in his family and his business is their primary source of income.\r\n\r\nThanks to his hard work, Tuichi has been able to build a house and educate his children. He has put a lot of effort into caring for his family and it is getting harder and harder as he gets older. His wife helps her husband with the farm and cares for the cattle. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Tuichi doesn't have enough money to complete construction of his home and has turned to Arvand for help with this problem.

Esta es la 2 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 1 a\u00f1o que viene desarrollando esta actividad de forma independiente.\nEs por esos motivos que Clara solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de instrumentos de manicura para independizarse y tener su sal\u00f3n de belleza propio.\n","en":"Clara is a 34-year-old woman. She is single with two children yes 4 and 15. She is a manicurist.\r\nShe is patient, a good listener, a good mother, enterprising, responsible, and committed to her work.\r\nShe runs her business in the south zone of the city, where once a year around a thousand artisans join together in the La Alasita market to sell all kinds of miniature goods with the goal that the miniatures will materialize and become reality. The region has a warm and very humid climate with a constant temperature of 30 degrees year round.\r\nClara is dark-skinned with long black hair. She is short and has dark-coloured eyes. Her mother tongue is Guarani and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for her business. She is pictured first on the right with the tiger shirt. \r\nShe shares her life with her children. The eldest is in school, but the youngest is not yet school-aged. She wants to progress and support her family; this desire has brought her to become the leader of a communal bank whose members' businesses include: transportation services, a video store, flatware sales, cell phone sales, chicken sales, flower sales, and a tea service. The group's purpose is to request a loan and expand the members' businesses. Clara mainly works as a manicurist. She cares for the hands and feet of her customers in a beauty salon where she works as an employee. \"A fundamental part of a person's personal presentation is their hands, and now, with the good weather, their feet\", she says.\r\nHer second source of income comes from desserts. She bakes a variety of traditional yucca, cheese, and rice flour-based pastries.\r\nBoth activities support her family. Her dream is to have her own beauty salon. She wants to become independent and provide manicures from her home. To do this, she needs to purchase materials such as flatware, towels, tongs, scissors, and oils. \r\nThis is her second loan sequence with the institution in the year that she has been doing this activity independently.\r\nFor these reasons, Clara is requesting a loan for the purchase of manicure supplies to become independent and have her own beauty salon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":1762031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase manicure supplies in order to have her own beauty salon.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-24T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":3700,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estefania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clara Cyntia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesus Antonio  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvania      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2011.32},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1988.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2016.39},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2045.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2074.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2072.48},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2160.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2163.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2194.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2226.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2257.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2289.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.84},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":288.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":292.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":296.74},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.96},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.71},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":313.45},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":313.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":318.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.99},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":332.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1169.62,"local_amount":8060.9,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":8081.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554424},{"amount":601.67,"local_amount":4146.68,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4157.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226976},{"amount":945.9,"local_amount":6519,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:29:30Z","rounded_local_amount":6535.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214152},{"amount":650.58,"local_amount":4483.71,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4495.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564276},{"amount":332.23,"local_amount":2289.71,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2295.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046249}],"funded_date":"2015-01-16T19:23:09Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:10:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":825587,"name":"Wilber Moises","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Wilber, tiene un negocio de venta de ropa para adultos y ni\u00f1os\/as, al realizar esta actividad obtiene ingresos que utiliza para cubrir las necesidades b\u00e1sicas familiares, no tiene ayuda econ\u00f3mica de otras personas, Wilber est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ado, es padre de una ni\u00f1a de 6 a\u00f1os de edad.

He is married with three children ages 6, 3, and 1. He is a fisherman.\r\nHe is independent, constant, responsible, patient, and hard-working. He works in the La Isla Suriqui community, located on an island of Lake Titicaca. It is an agricultural area where the people raise cattle and sheep and live off of fish and local vegetables such as quinoa, chu\u00f1o, beans, and potatoes. The area has a cold climate, and the solar rays are harsh. The average altitude is 3800 metres above sea level.\r\nFernando is dark-skinned and short with short black hair. His mother tongue is Aymara; it is spoken in the region for business. In the city, he speaks Spanish. He lives with his wife, who is a farmer. They live in their own adobe home, which does not have drinking water or electricity.\r\nHe fishes in a boat with a net. Fishing on Lake Titicaca is one of the most beautiful ways to fish. It is an art. Fisherman are respectful of the lake and the seabed; the art of fishing consists of tossing a net, usually 30 metres long, into the lake. It is left to fall to the bottom and sits for a day. Then, it is simply collected again, carefully so that it does not drag or damage the seabed. The fisherman are careful to make sure that they only capture fish the size they are seeking, which is determined by the size of the net. They only fish the varieties they want. \r\n\"Fishing on the lake is very peaceful. The cold of the lake freezes everything around it. We have to be quite patient in our daily work\" he says.\r\nFernando's dream is to improve his family's quality of life. He wants to expand his business by buying more fishing nets wholesale, since the nets are constantly breaking and he constantly has to repair them. This is his first loan cycle with the institution in the five years he has been doing this work.\r\nFor these reasons, Fernando is requesting a loan for the wholesale purchase of fishing nets so that he can always have tools for his work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1762033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

lenders! Meet Rose, a youthful 31-year-old mother, a wise farmer whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kapsowar, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Rose is happily married and together with her husband, blessed with four lovely children. \r\n\r\nFor the past five years, she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been growing maize, milk, cabbages, tomatoes and also she keeps dairy cows. Rose has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Rose mobilized other women in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a micro finance institution that assists aspiring women like her. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy another motorbike. Rose is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge, hence suffering so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables, and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan Rose is going to achieve her dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Rose feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of this loan are astronomical, because Rose will never suffer losses due to delays in delivery of produce to the market and also, she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market hence increased income level. Rose is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work. With your loan, Rose will improve her living conditions and assure her children and grandchildren to come of a secure future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":368.56,"image":{"id":1761603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy another motorbike to transport produce to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-24T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.43,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.8,"local_amount":6293.27,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":6398.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262704},{"amount":67.48,"local_amount":5998.36,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":6098.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601058},{"amount":72.46,"local_amount":6582.7,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6692.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.6,"payment_id":681377932},{"amount":64.67,"local_amount":6092.98,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6194.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.88,"payment_id":711505912},{"amount":39.05,"local_amount":3604.6,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3664.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.5,"payment_id":731022734},{"amount":45.67,"local_amount":4188.28,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4258.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.45,"payment_id":752110927}],"funded_date":"2014-12-26T06:28:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":817971,"name":"Vanna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vanna, 44, is a married woman who lives in a small community of Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia.

A married mother of seven, she lives in Lobougoula with her husband and their children in a nuclear family. Lobougoula is part of a commune in the circle of Sikasso, the third administrative region of the republic of MALI. A good woman who unsuccessfully tried out several businesses, Mrs. RAMATA started buying and selling phone cards (\"z\u00e8r\u00e8\" and \"paani\" are the names in Bambara for phone cards for the two phone companies in Mali). She stocks up in SIKASSO and in BAMAKO. In order to satisfy the needs of her increasingly growing clientele, she is seeking her seventh individual loan from microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. The previous loans were properly repaid. This loan will allow her to buy large quantities of phone cards, which will be sold locally in Lobougoula for cash. She foresees earning an average monthly profit of 285,000 FCFA.

Madina is involved in sewing national women's clothing to-order at home. She is also a university student. Madina has a lot of desire to study. She wants to study and work at the same time to cover her expenses. Madina requested this loan to buy a new sewing machine. Because her current sewing machine does not function as well as it used to, she decided to buy a new one in order to continue her work and retain her income source.

When asked, Talatu spoke of her ambition to use the additional income to educate her children, eventually hoping to make more money for herself and her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1663354,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for her children's school fees and uniforms. thereby eliminating pressure to sell corn for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-12-24T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Talatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":9485,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":9485}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-24T20:57:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dara Olmsted Silverstein","image":973449}},{"id":817976,"name":"Damarice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Damarice is 42 years old, married and together with her spouse they have been blessed with two children.

Meet Margaret, 44 years of age and a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Kibomet, a remote village in Kitale. She is happily married and is blessed with four adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last ten years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Kitale area is very populated and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming and she is seeking a loan of 65,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved and she will be able to buy more poultry. As a result of the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market. This will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry market to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children.\r\nYour support is needed not only by Margaret but also her four children who want to study through to university

of his service. He is a 64-year-old man, currently separated from his wife, but he does not forget that that woman gave him the three most important and beautiful treasures of his life, his children. He takes responsibility and sends money to support not only his ex-wife but to help her in different circumstances and difficulties that present themselves.

He wants to invest in his business by purchasing dairy cattle to increase the production of dairy foods. This is his first loan cycle with the institution in the six years that he's been working independently."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":303.11,"image":{"id":1761946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Shavkat buys cattle at a bazaar for a low price, and resells his animals for a profit at a higher price after they've been fattened a bit.  Shavkat's wife is a seasonal farm worker and helps her husband provide for their family.  In her free time, his wife also milks cows and sells milk to their neighbors, buying domesticated fowl with the proceeds.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Shavkat is having difficulties due to the fact that cattle prices have fallen, and he can no longer sell cattle as a result.  He needs to stock up on cattle feed but lacks the money to do so, and has turned to Arvand for help with this problem.  Using the money received from a loan, he wants to buy hay and pre-mixed cattle feed.

Su negocio es la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos por cat\u00e1logo, actividad que realiza durante todos los d\u00edas de la semana en horario libre. Su segunda actividad es como asistente de dentista, actividad que realiza de lunes a s\u00e1bados por la noche. Ambas actividades logran pagar sus gastos. Su sue\u00f1o es tener una tienda de cosm\u00e9ticos para mejorar la atenci\u00f3n a sus clientes. Ella desea incrementar su capital de trabajo y adquirir mayor cantidad de cosm\u00e9ticos por la temporada alta de ventas para satisfacer a sus clientes. Esta es la 13 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 6 a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Clara solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para adquirir mayor cantidad de cosm\u00e9ticos por temporada alta y satisfacer a sus clientes.\n","en":"Clara is a 45 year old woman, single, without children, and her business is selling cosmetics.\r\n\r\nShe has a good attitude. She is generous, friendly, independent, active, responsible and committed to her work. Her business takes place in the southern area of the city, characterized for being set along the banks of the majestic waterway, having traditional weekends, with rustic buildings made of local materials where you can enjoy traditional local food and do some sport activities. It is a warm climate, tropical and humid with a temperature that varies during the day between approximately 21-35 degrees Celsius throughout the entire year.\r\n\r\nClara is short and has a dark complexion with long black hair which she ties back. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed and she has a general knowledge of Spanish and uses it for business. She shares her life with relatives who are adults and independent. She lives in a family home with running water, electricity, and a sewer system. \r\n\r\nHer dream to improve her business is to lead a group of people with commercial activities who are requesting loans to expand their businesses such as: selling cell phone covers, selling coca leaves, selling quinoa juice, selling refreshments and selling skirts. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling cosmetics by catalog, an activity she does every day of the week in free time. Her second activity is as a dental assistant, and activity that she does Monday through Saturdays in the evenings. Both activities allow her to pay her expenses. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a cosmetics store in order to improve service to her customers. She wants to increase her working capital and acquire more cosmetics for the high season of sales in order to satisfy her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is the 13th sequence of loans with the institution in the 6 years that she has been doing this activity. It is for these reasons that Clara is asking for a loan in order to buy more cosmetics for the busy season to satisfy her customers.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1762047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more cosmetics for the high season in order to satisfy her customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-24T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-07T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":5150,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Ingrid Eudalis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clara Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Michelli Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hortenc","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shirley Ro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina Ju","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":35500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":5150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4593.55},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4796.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4933.04},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5073.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5217.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5366.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5519.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":695.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":715.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":736.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":756.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":778.51},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":825586,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700.9,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cereals for storage and subsequent resale.

Her daughter is only 19 years old, and her husband is 53 years old. Jamila is involved in sewing women's clothing to-order. She has been running this business for over 5 years. Jamila requested a loan because she wants to finish her repairs. She was able to repair only one room, where this photograph was taken. The rest of the rooms in her house remain without renovations, and Jamila wants to obtain this loan and repair the remaining rooms. Jamila intends to use the loan amount to buy building materials. She has been living in an old house for many years and has been saving money for repairs. She was very disappointed to learn that she would not have enough money to complete her repairs, and her only solution was to obtain a

eighteen grandchildren. He was born and raised in a rural area, completed 9 school grades and helped his parents with the household. He has been taking care of livestock, taking it to pasture, milking cows, gathering harvest and selling it a market from a very young age. Now he owns a plot of land, where he is involved in animal husbandry. He has fifteen sheep and five cows. His youngest son helps him with the business. Despite Andimutolib's age, he does not complain and gladly works in cold and hot weather alike. At the present time, he wants to increase his livestock headcount, but does not have the sufficient amount of money. This is why he requested financial support from MDO Arvand. He hopes that the Arvand organization will approve his request for help and provide him with the necessary amount. He is grateful in advance for the support and trust."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1755952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Meet Mercy, 28 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Kesses, a remote village in Eldoret. She is happily married and is blessed with two adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last 5 years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling rabbit meat, eggs and a variety of food crops from her farmland. \r\n\r\nTo make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Eldoret area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable. She stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. \r\n\r\nShe lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES to buy poultry. Being a woman, accessing funds is very challenging. Through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market. This will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets. This will increase her income and improve her living conditions.
