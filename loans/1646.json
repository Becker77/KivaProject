Meet Agnes, a 57-year-old youthful mum. She is a very hardworking, honest, and ever smiling mother of two children. She lives with her husband in a remote village in Kapsowar, in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. Agnes passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past 10 years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding her family requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are milk, crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her parents and family. \r\n\r\nIn farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. The main challenge that Agnes faces is that her cows stray to her neighbour's compound. This has been causing many losses to her, because she has to compensate for the damages caused by the animals.

They trade in condiments, soap, ground nut paste, and miscellaneous products. After repaying their previous loans on tome, group DJEKAFO\u2019s women are on their fourth solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nAWA, the woman all the way to the right in the photo, intends on using her loan to purchase three buckets of ground nut paste and five boxes of soap. She procures her products from local wholesalers. She retails to a mixed-gender clientele. She takes cash and often offers payment plans.\r\n\r\nShe foresees an average monthly profit of 25,000 XOF, which will be used for expenses relative to healthcare, food, clothing, and school fees.

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a big family: my parents, three sisters and me. All my sisters are married and live separate from us, they have own children. I am 18 and single. My parents are farmers; we live in the village in Osh region. In summer we go far to the mountains to the pastures, where we raise cows and sheep in order to make them fat and sell them in fall. We also grow potatoes, onions and other vegetables there, what we sell at the market and earn additional money. As you see, my family doesn\u2019t have a stable monthly salary; everything depends on summer weather, mountain water and good harvest. Although my parents are old enough, they are continuing to work at the farm and on the land. It happens because of the lack of higher education. Nobody studied at the university in our family. Therefore, my father wants to educate me although he hasn\u2019t enough money for my tuition.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn\u2019t concentrate on my studies while studying at school as I had helped my parents with the household. I loved English from school and tried to participate at English Olympiad at the 11th grade, but failed it. After that I tried to enter New Generation Academy of AUCA, as I was told that AUCA provides full scholarship for the 70 brilliant school-leavers from poor families of Kyrgyzstan. I understood that I should try, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have any chance to enter this prestigious university. I am thankful to this life, what gave me such a wonderful chance to study at the one-year-program at New Generation Academy for free. We completed a rigorous program in English, Kyrgyz, Russian languages, and College Math that are oriented towards developing critical and analytic thinking.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to New Generation Academy, I could pass the entering exams that I am a freshman now. I love AUCA. It changed me and my life totally. I will study hard and do my best in order to get bachelor degree in Economics here.

Sohiba loves animals and this is why she is involved in animal husbandry. Sohiba has been involved in fattening up cattle for just one year.

Edwin, from Kapsowar, a remote town in Kenya, is an active and progressive farmer in his locality. He has a wife and 2 children, and together they live on a small piece of land.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, Edwin's primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crop cultivation, and personal business. He has been farming for the past 10 years. Over so much time, Edwin has been able to gain a great amount of experience, so that now he is always ranked the best farmer in his village.\r\n\r\nKenyans drink a lot of milk. This tradition is probably derived from tribal culture, particularly in the Nandi tribe (Edwin\u2019s tribe), where cows represent wealth. Demand for dairy milk has been high, and Edwin wants to take advantage of the market. Therefore, Edwin is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is profitable in Kenya, and Edwin has already identified the breed of dairy cow that he wants to purchase.\r\n\r\nEdwin always says that to become a successful dairy farmer, one does not need to be a livestock expert. All one needs is passion, information, and the keenness to learn from successful farmers. As well, Edwin has planted so many trees that food for the dairy cows will never be a problem.\r\n\r\nMarketing of the milk and other dairy products will not be a challenge because Edwin will sell the milk both directly to the market and also to big dairy processing firms. With his loan Edwin will not only benefit from milk sales but also the cows' manure. He will use it to improve the fertility of his farm's soil, thus saving money that would have otherwise been spent on fertilizer. Edwin has been facing challenges in accessing financing, but he feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva, are there to make his dream come true.\r\n\r\nEdwin chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate is not only low but also calculated on a reducing balance. Edwin underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and during the training season he learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. With his accumulated profits Edwin plans to permanently improve his living conditions and secure the future of his school-aged children by paying their tuition fees. He also plans to buy more dairy cows, build a bio-gas digester, and hence save costs incurred in buying fuel."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1789212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-09T00:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-08T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3733.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3842.38},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3954.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4070.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4189.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4311.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4437.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4567.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4700.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4838.18},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4979.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5125.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":825347,"name":"Zubaydullo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zubaydullo was born in 1985 year.

He has finished a technical college. Since 2008 he has been manufacturing various metal articles. For example, he takes orders for making gates, railings, and support rods for yurts [traditional tent homes]. He also resells metal construction material. His merchandise stock is valued at 250,000 KGS. Since Maratbek's goods are in great demand, and his customer following keeps increasing he has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to buy fittings, angle bars and structural steel for resale. Maratbek is a member of the Marat [borrowers'] group, which includes two other members. Maratbek plans to invest the resulting revenue in the purchase of a truck needed for his business.

With her own resources, she bought jeans for selling and with the help of a nephew. It is he who carries out the purchases of the jeans in the city of Medell\u00edn, where they get good sewing, quality and good prices. \r\n\r\nEmilce started offering the products to her neighbors, family members and friends. Currently, she brings payment facilities to her customers and she does her purchases in with her cash working capital. Emilce is applying for a Kiva loan, the first loan that she does from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, by which she will stock her business with the new models of jeans for this December season.\r\n\r\nThis investment will favor her sales and, with that, the income obtained. She is a mother of four children and has a future family goal of making some improvements to her home. Because of this, she works very committed and dedicated. She wishes to continue working in order to grow her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1761926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to stock her business with the new models of jeans for this December season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-12-25T01:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-08T01:10:06Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":67.88,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilce Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":93337},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":96137},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":99021},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101992},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105052},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":108203},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":111449},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":114793},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":118237},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":121779}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.43},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.68},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.64},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.43,"local_amount":93337,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:47:34Z","rounded_local_amount":96131.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611789362},{"amount":365.69,"local_amount":976663,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1005905.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":67.88,"payment_id":711475354}],"funded_date":"2015-01-23T01:31:02Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T14:46:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alex Martin","image":1188596}},{"id":818291,"name":"David Ernesto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"David, es soltero, vive con su familia, es muy responsable y dedicado a buscar la manera de poyar en los gastos familiares, su negocio es la crianza de pollos, su familia le ayuda en sus actividades, tiene 3 a\u00f1os de haber emprendido su negocio y sus padres han sido las personas que le ense\u00f1aron este oficio, semanalmente est\u00e1 produciendo 60 pollos adultos para poder venderlos.

From his young age on he has been working in the fields, taking care of livestock, and growing fruits and vegetables. Mukim wanted to go to college, but his parents did not have the means for that, which is why he started growing produce once he got  married. For some 18 years Mukim has been growing potatoes, carrots, wheat and cotton on his land plot. He started with two ha [about 5 acres] of land and gradually has increased his plot to 25 ha [62 acres], where he grows his produce to be sold at the market. His wife and children help him. His produce sells well because Mukim puts a lot of care in his work. He is taking out a loan to fertilizer his soil and buy seeds, but he lacks the full amount needed. This is why he has applied to the Arvand microfinance institution for financial support. He hopes that Arvand will respond to his request for help and approves his loan. Mukim thanks you in advance for your support and trust.

55-year old man, married and the happy father of six and grandfather of 15. For 40 years already he has been working as a farmer. From a young age Mirzosafar helped his parents in the household and learned the secrets of farming, studied the specific qualities of plants and fruit trees, and learned about the various planting seasons. He has raised six children, provided them with a good education and helped them find their place in life. Now as he is getting older Mizosafar continues to work and make a living. He never complains about the weather or his health and is always upbeat and energetic when working in the field and treating his soil. At present he plans to fertilize his soil and plants new seeds, but his funds are insufficient. This is why he turned to the Arvand microfinance institution for financial support. Mirzosafar thanks Arvand in advance for its help and trust.

She has three children, ages 3 months, 2, and 9.  Her business is selling used clothing.  She's a sensitive, sincere, understanding, patient, supportive, enterprising, responsible, and hardworking woman, as well as a good listener and a good mother.\r\n\r\nShe works as a street vendor in the Plan 3000 neighborhood, an area known for its huge population growth: Miners relocated from the west and ethnic groups like the Ayoreo people, natives of the area, settled there.  The next generation works primarily in commerce and manufacturing.  The tropical climate is warm and humid, with a temperature that varies between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n\r\nNina is short and dark and wears her long dark hair tied back.  Her native language is Guarani and she speak Spanish for cultural reasons and for business.  She lives with her partner, who works in construction, and her children; the eldest is in school and the younger ones are not yet of school age.  They live in a rented brick house with a corrugated metal roof, and they have potable water, electricity, and a sewage system.\r\n\r\nHer desire to improve herself for her family's good made her form a bank with people to request a loan and expand their businesses, which include quinoa juice sales, perfume sales, soft drink sales, traditional pollera skirt sales, ice cream sales, empanada sales, lamb meat sales, and an auto repair shop.  Her second job is selling costume jewelry (bracelets, rings, earrings, etc.) on foot in shops.\r\n\r\nShe works both jobs during the day, taking turns at each job.  \"I alternate between two jobs.

Meet Alice, a young, hardworking small holder farmer who is 37 years of age. She is happily married to a handsome man, and they are blessed with six children. She hails from Munyaka, a remote village in the Kitale area of Kenya. Her upbringing was challenging and she never went to college so that she could secure a formal job, but she did not surrender to that, and has been practicing farming for the past fifteen years. \r\n\r\nThrough farming, she has been able to take care of her young family. Her main source of income has been milk, eggs and crop farming, and through these ventures, she has supported her family because she is the breadwinner. Alice passionately loves farming and has even nicknamed one of her animals \u201cBlacky,\u201d which is an English word depicting the color of the cow. Alice stated that the most enjoyable bit about farming is \u201cit gives me personal fulfillment and feeds my family.\" \r\n\r\nAlthough she has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious mum. She has been facing challenges transporting her produce from the farm to the market; that is why she is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. The Kitale area is a rural town and roads are very poor. For Alice, transporting goods has always been a \u201cnightmare.\u201d She has been suffering losses because goods reach the market when they are not fresh, hence fetching a low price. Vegetables and milk are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, and through the loan, she will be able to achieve her dream. \r\n\r\nAlice plans to employ someone who will be helping her in farm work and transporting the produce to the market, hence impacting the society positively through creation of employment. Increased profits from the loan will allow her to repay the loan fully and be able to permanently change her living conditions and assure her children of a secure future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":284.58,"image":{"id":1789308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike to transport her produce from the farm to the market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-09T04:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-08T04:10:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.93,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2150.41},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2213.26},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2277.94},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2344.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2413.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2483.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2556.13},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2630.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2707.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2786.85},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2868.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2952.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3038.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3127.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3218.59},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.65},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3409.4},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3509.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.79},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.55},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.47},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.4},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.4},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.44},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.62,"local_amount":5420.22,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5432.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824772},{"amount":50.08,"local_amount":4552.8,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4563.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264936},{"amount":56.53,"local_amount":5139.33,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5151.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459570},{"amount":55.63,"local_amount":5161.89,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5173.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.15,"payment_id":696587654},{"amount":59.79,"local_amount":5597.49,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5610.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.78,"payment_id":731022782}],"funded_date":"2015-01-11T08:48:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":825413,"name":"Noshaba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noshaba is 45 years old and a married woman.

Meet Anne, a youthful 48-year-old shosho (old mum), a wise farmer whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kitale, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Anne is happily married and together with her husband, blessed with four lovely children. For the past 19 years she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been growing maize, cabbage, tomatoes and also, she keeps dairy cows. Anne has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. <br \/><br \/>Anne mobilized other women in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Anne is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge; hence she has suffered so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan Anne is going to achieve her dream and goals. <br \/><br \/>Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Anne feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Anne will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market and also she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market; hence an increased income level. Ann is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping with farm work. With your loan, Anne will improve her living conditions and assure her children and grandchildren to come of a secure future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":521.49,"image":{"id":1789297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Saratu spoke of her ambition to use the additional income to educate her children, eventually hoping to ensure her children are educated and have professional jobs.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1631354,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

With this loan, Juan can fill this need and continue to offer his services to his customers.\r\n\r\nJuan's dream is to continue offering his services to people in the community, and to have more mills so that he can grind other grinds such as coffee, or flour for animals."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":218.61,"image":{"id":1789626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy belts for his mill.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-01-09T08:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-08T08:20:06Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Jos\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":21.11},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":22.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":23.23},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":23.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":24.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":26.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":27.32},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":29.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.32},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.88,"local_amount":21.88,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":21.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833606},{"amount":22.72,"local_amount":22.72,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":22.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636201328},{"amount":23.99,"local_amount":23.99,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":23.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650537061},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":22.73,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":22.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666802966},{"amount":23.71,"local_amount":23.71,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":23.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683483035},{"amount":24.99,"local_amount":24.99,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":24.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696540606},{"amount":24.97,"local_amount":24.97,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":24.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711454120},{"amount":26.38,"local_amount":26.38,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":26.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730974707},{"amount":27.24,"local_amount":27.24,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":27.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752063266}],"funded_date":"2015-01-20T08:38:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":825448,"name":"Noc","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noc is 52 years old and he is requesting this loan to pay for his daughter\u2019s university fees.
