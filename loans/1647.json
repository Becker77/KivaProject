They are on average 34 years old and have on average four children. They all live in the Missira neighborhood of Segou (the fourth administrative region of Mali). They met each other through neighborhood, family, and marriage connections and from their businesses in the village. They run small clothing and food-serving businesses. With the goal of increasing their business funds, the group members decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their sixth group loan. Mrs. Soumai (second woman standing from the right in the photo) is a grand seller of pagne wax (traditions wrap-arounds) in Segou. The sales are made for cash and often for credit from home and at the market to a mixed clientele.

They are on average 37 years old and have on average six children. They all live in the Angoul\u00eame neighborhood of S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of Mali). They met each other through neighborhood, family, and marriage connections and from their businesses in the village. They run small clothing and food-serving businesses. With the goal of increasing their business funds, the group members decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their third group loan. Mrs. Maimouna (the woman standing to the far left in the photo) is a big seller of secondhand clothing in the neighborhood and surrounding areas.

He is married with 3 children aged between 6 months and 7 years old, two of them whom go to school. He is a farmer and has been farming for 19 years now. With the loan from Kiva, he would like to buy maize fertilizers for sale. The profits from the business will be used to improve his standards of living.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She is a hardworking mum and aggressive with the principle of truth on her lips; she is honest and faithful to what she does and what she says. \r\n\r\nKabiyet lies in a valley. In this valley are a people who, in their totality, constitute wrenching statistics. Hardcore poverty pervades every homestead yet every day when you look beyond the numbers, you will see a sea of people: a sea of about 2,000 bright, vibrant, open faces, searching and yearning for the opportunity to live a life of dignity and respect. They have the conviction that it\u2019s possible. They are like the bones in the \u201cvalley of dry bones\u201d that required only a breath to spring back to life. \r\n\r\nArmed with this conviction, Ileen has kept hope and has been toiling on her farm for the past five years. Her primary source of income is milk, crops and some vegetables that she plants. She also engages in a personal business and has been able to earn a handsome profit from the venture. Ileen practices agriculture with a difference, employing youthful energy, enthusiasm and knowledge from the many agricultural training courses she has been attending to broaden her skills. \r\n\r\nAlthough she earns handsome profits from farming, Ileen faces one big challenge of poor crop production. She is kindly requesting a loan to build a greenhouse. A greenhouse provides controlled temperatures which assist in crop production. Through the loan she will double her crop production because her crops will not be affected by harsh and bad weather conditions.\r\n\r\nYour lending will contribute greatly to the actualization of Ileen\u2019s goal, which is to expand the greenhouse .

For the last 19 years, Irma has run her own business selling groceries and other miscellaneous items in Brazzaville, the Republic of Congo. Irma has a small shop in front of her house where she sells cooking oil, soap, sugar, rice and other miscellaneous items. In order to grow her business, Irma joined HOPE Congo in 2013 and became part of the community bank group DIEU BENIT 2 (2). \r\n\r\nShe would like to take out a loan of 500,000 CFA to continue to invest in her business. With this money, Irma will be able to purchase additional sacks of sugar and rice to divide up into smaller portions to sell. She will also buy salted fish, soap, and beans to add to her stock. Being a part of DIEU BENIT 2 (2) has helped Irma to combat the constant fluctuations in market prices now that she is able to purchase all her goods at once. Irma brings in customers by welcoming people with open arms so that people feel at ease in her shop. \r\n\r\nIn the future Irma hopes that her business will become stable enough that she will be able to travel to other countries and launch herself into commerce. Irma dreams of traveling to Cotonou, Benin to purchase appliances and clothes for resale in Brazzaville, where such items are unavailable.

For the past five years Charity has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, vegetables, and some personal business she engages in to make extra cash. \r\n\r\nShe has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She passionately loves dairy farming. \u201cCows are part of me. I love cows, I walk cows, I sleep cows, I eat cows,\u201d she says. The village women call her Mrs.Cow. \r\n\r\nCharity sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the main challenge she faces is the lack of a proper fence in her compound. Her cows have been straying to neighbors' farms and this has been causing a lot of animosity among the neighbors. She has been forced to pay for the damages caused by her cows. \r\n\r\nShe is kindly seeking a loan to buy barbed wire.

He has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and he had no problem in repaying since the loan payment is deducted every pay day. He looks forward for your positive response and any assistance from you will surely be of great help. He will use the loan to pay his debts and also meet personal needs.\r\n\r\nAllan wants to have a stable source of income so he can meet his family's daily needs and expenses.  He wants to give his family a better life someday. He meets up with his co-fellowship** members to share stories of his work.\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine.

One of the main dilemmas of employees, like Marian, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made many heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Marian is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying them since the loan payment is deducted every pay day.  She looks forward for your positive response and any coming amount from you will surely be of great help. She will also use the loan to get back the ATM card that she pawned and also to pay the educational expenses of her children.\r\n\r\nMarian wants for her children to be able to complete their studies. She meets up with his co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine.

About 2 years ago she had a parallel activity, in particular, she was trading with clothing and had her own customers, but she stopped this business due to lack of financial funds. She has now requested a loan to local financial institutions to re-start this mentioned activity. Veriko's loan application was rejected several times and at last the start up program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, approved it. \r\nVeriko plans to purchase stocks of home products and clothing at wholesale prices in the capital, where the widest market in the country is located.

Here is his story:\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of the reasons why I want to study at AUCA is because of a high and qualified education. The fact that AUCA is not interacted with corruption interests me the most.\r\n\r\nThere is much diversity in AUCA as it is an American University of Central Asia; students from different countries come to study here. I like the AUCA atmosphere and AUCA spirit, where all teachers and students are tolerant and kind to help others, and they do it with pleasure.\r\n\r\nSince childhood I dreamt to get education in International and Business Law. The reason why I want to be in IBL is because of global problems like poverty and war between nations and countries. The tears that come from little children make me feel upset and push me to choose this field, which helps me to support my country and those desperate families. As people say, if the person wants to change the world, he\/she should start from himself\/herself. \r\n\r\nI find the lawyer profession very responsible and respectful one. And think that a lawyer is a representative of the country and he\/she isn\u2019t to make any kind of mistakes as he\/she is to save one\u2019s life. I can say that I am a responsible person and this profession is for me. I have a great desire to study and I have a dream to realize. Thanks to Kiva lenders I can get a degree at AUCA, gain experience in my field and earn belief of the people in me.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1789421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in returning it back since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day.

and Comparative Politics. Here is his story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am requesting a Kiva loan because my family can\u2019t afford my university tuition fee. I am thankful for AUCA in making me a discount, but still the rest of the tuition is too high for me. I have a great desire to study at AUCA, because AUCA is among the few higher education establishments in the region, which offer a social science education.\r\n\r\nI am proud to be a winner of the one-year-study-program at New Generation Academy in 2013. This Program not only covered fully my tuition for that year, allowed me to get a stipend and housing, but changed the whole world for me. First, it taught me English and made familiar with AUCA. Second, it presented me a lot of friends from different parts of Kyrgyzstan, who were eager to gain knowledge. Third, thanks to it I could pass the entering exams of AUCA. \r\n\r\nWhen I was eleven we lost my father. My mother raised me alone and always worked to keep us, to give me a good education. As my mother is a school teacher, she has a small salary, which is not even enough for our daily necessities. Sometimes we get support from our relatives, but they have their own families and aren\u2019t able to help us always. \r\n\r\nI know that Kiva changes people's life for the better. I hope it will do the same with mine.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1789424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She is 49 years old and the mother of six children. Hokima is married to a high school teacher. \r\n\r\nHokima has dedicated 10 years of her life to the business of sewing women's clothing. She loves her work and would like to continue to work in this area. She has worked many years with one sewing machine and all her work has been performed thanks to this machine.

She is not married. \r\n\r\nHayriniso finished high school with good grades, but due to circumstances she was unfortunately not able to get higher education. However, she has worked as a secretary for three years already. She combines this work with other activities such as agriculture. Hayriniso copes well with the agriculture work. \r\n\r\nThe reason for Hayriniso's loan request is to renovate her home. The cold period has already set in, but she has not been able to renovate her house and prepare it for the winter. Thankfully the temperature in Tajikistan is still +8 degrees Celsius. Since Hayriniso does not have enough money, she applied for a loan. She will use the money to purchase material and in a short time renovate her house."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1788228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase building materials and renovate her home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Fayzabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"37.873056 69.775556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-01-09T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-08T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hayriniso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":312},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":364.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":361.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":374.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":392.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":406.98},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":418.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":433.85},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":447.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":470.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":485.36},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":532.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.84},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.07},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":825538,"name":"Anjela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anjela is a married mother of six children.

His native language is Aymara but he also speaks Spanish to comply with the general culture and for his business, making cholita (traditional bolivian women that wear hats, shawls and skirts) shoes.\r\nHe began as regular shoemaker and later specialized in the fabrication of cholita shoes. His creations are innovative and he prepares the shoes on demand and for folkloric dance groups.\r\nHe delivers the ordered shoes in his car, which is thus one of his working tools. This car, however, is damaged and he therefore has to resolve to taking taxis, which result in higher costs.\r\nHe dreams of expanding his shoemakers shop. He also hopes to repair his car so that he can deliver the orders on time.\r\nThis is the first sequence of loans that Julio asks of Kiva in the past three years that he has been establishing his business.\r\nFor these reasons Julio is asking for a loan to repair his car and thus carry out his shoe deliveries on time."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1763743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal

Mami is a popular Filipino dish of noodles made from fresh eggs; chicken, pork or beef; and broth. It can be eaten for lunch, dinner or snacks, especially in the cold months. In the Philippines, a food vendor is a common sight, especially in populated areas. Maxima cooks well, and that is why her mami is popular in their area with neighbors and the local working community as her regular customers. Aside from her food business, she also also buys and sells scraps and metals at her junk shop. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 net income a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her maintain her businesses, Maxima is requesting a PHP 40,000 loan to buy ingredients like pork, fish, chicken, seasonings, and egg noodles that she needs for cooking mami. She will use part of the loan to pay for scraps and metals to sell. She is thanking God in advance for the financial help that will surely cover their everyday needs and schooling of her children. She wishes everyone a Blessed Christmas!\r\n\r\nMaxima dreams of having a small eatery to expand her business. She wants to secure the education of her children and see them become professionals.

Things have gotten difficult now, though, because my parents' income has been very affected by the financial situation at home right now.  This is preventing me from being able to finish college when I have barely only eight trimesters left.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you can approve me for this loan so I can complete my studies and achieve my goal of becoming a doctor so when I'm done I can specialize in cardiovascular surgery, which is what I enjoy.

Gavhar has one daughter, who is 26 years old. For Gavhar, her daughter is the closest person on Earth. She is the purpose of life and motivation for continuing to live and moving forward. Gavhar has been involved in sewing women's national-style clothing for 6 years. Gavhar also makes embroideries on several dresses. She can sew as many as 25 dresses in one month. Gavhar beautifully handles her work, and the number of her clients has been gradually increasing. Gavhar requested this loan because she needs to replace her current sewing machine that is no longer in a working order and had served her for a very long time. The new sewing machine is expensive, and Gavhar is short a small amount of money to purchase it. She decided to obtain the remaining amount as a

He is married. He has a big family. Zoirjon works as a cook in a tea house. Tea houses in Tajikistan are places where young and old go to have a cup of tea and talk, to exchange news, to share joy, and to get advice with problems. Zoirjon loves his job since he can help people with their leisure time and encourage communication between different generations. His work is the main source of income for the family. Though his grown children help, Zoirjon is the head of the family and therefore does everything he can to ensure his family's comfort. The income he earns from the tea house is not enough to follow through with his plans. Therefore, Zoirjon would like a loan to maintain his house and install wooden frames. On the advice of friends, he approached Arvand. He hopes that with Arvand's help, he will be able to renovate his home. Zoirjon thanks you in advance for your support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1753253,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy building materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-12-25T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-08T19:50:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zoirjon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":205.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":222.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":230.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":230.26},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":236.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":245.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":252.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":258.18},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":265.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":272.54},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":282.31},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":297.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":825754,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Mercy, 46, resident of Bacoor, Cavite, the Philippines.

ready-made clothes as part of a small clothing business she runs in Chandkheda, Gujarat, with her husband\u2019s support. She supports her household and the education of her three children through the income she generates. She earns 4,000 Indian rupees (INR) a month, which amounts to a third of her family\u2019s monthly income. Her contribution keeps her family financially stable, providing a buffer in any sort of crisis. \r\n\r\nHowever, the 3,000 INR that she diligently saves each month leaves no spare funds for her business expansion plans, courtesy of the cash crunch. With the future of their children's education at stake, Mayaben and her husband need to grow their microenterprise. She wants to invest in buying greater quantities of garments, such as T-shirts, shirts, and jeans. These garments enjoy a high demand from her customers. By selling more of these, she will be able to grow her revenue. Additionally, she will improve her margin by negotiating better bulk purchase rates and saving on transportation costs with fewer trips to the wholesale market. These measures will bring in an extra 6,000 INR a month. She will take home 2,000 INR and invest the rest in further expansion of her business. \r\n\r\nMayaben and the four other local women microentrepreneurs in her group together seek a loan of 65,000 INR, which will be repaid over 12 months. With their share of the loan, Ishita and Chandaben will grow their clothing businesses, Vaishaliben will develop her decoration business, and Vaishaliben will grow her rakhi business. The loan will not only finance their business plans in the immediate future but will also ensure that they enjoy a better future financially and socially. \r\n\r\nHaving had to drop out of school at an early age due to financial constraints, Mayaben is very passionate about ensuring that her children go through college. She has a preschooler, a child in primary school, and a teenager in secondary school. She wants all three of them to complete their education and access better opportunities in life. Your loan will help her make this hope a reality. She is grateful for this opportunity and your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":787.5,"image":{"id":1757992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing
