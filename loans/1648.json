a small district called Yavan. Yavan is known for its unique nature and pleasant climate, compared to other places in the Republic. Oyquz is a married 47-year-old woman. She is a mother of four children (a son and three daughters). Her son left to work in the Russian Federation after graduating from school. The oldest daughter got married and lives separately. Oyquz lives with her husband and two daughters. Her daughters are secondary school students.\r\n\r\nOyquz has been involved in agriculture for 11 years.

If I get the Kiva loan, I will pay my university fee and I will be able to continue my studies just as before.\r\n\r\nI live with my father, grandmother and two sisters in Batken region, far from Bishkek. Last year, I won a full scholarship for a one-year study program at New Generation Academy and I moved to Bishkek. The program provided me with free studies, housing and a meal plan. It was the first time I left my home and I felt sorry for my family, but I was eager to study and now I am happy to be a freshman at AUCA.\r\n\r\nMy father is 53 years old and has health problems but still works to provide for our family. My grandmother is a pensioner and my younger sister takes care of her. My elder sister studies at one of the local universities. We have livestock, we work in the field, grow vegetables and fruits then sell them at the markets. Our work is typical for villagers.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a school-girl I couldn\u2019t even dream about attending AUCA. Thanks to New Generation Academy, I could enter AUCA and now kindly ask Kiva lenders to help me with the tuition fee. I promise to do my best, to study hard and I will try to make my way on my own.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1789895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Her business is the production of artisan cheese.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, an entrepreneur, steady, responsible and hardworking. She transacts her work in the community of Batallas which is 60 kilometers from the city. Characterized by its proximity to the sacred Lake Titicaca, the climate is cold and dry where the sun\u2019s rays hit the Earth\u2019s surface with great force.\r\n\r\nFrancisca has a dark complexion, is short, and has long braided black hair. Her mother language is Aymara and she has general knowledge of Spanish using it for business. She shares her life with her husband who works in agriculture. They live together in an adobe house with a tin roof and have electric lights and well water. They have made artisanal cheese together and dairy products. The place exudes tranquility. The smell of cheese invades every corner of the house. \r\n\r\nThe process they go through follows: it starts with the certification of milk to know the actual performance that they will have. After the milk certification is the process of transforming by cooking at a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius for about 30 minutes. Then it is left to cool and rennet and salt is added. \u201cOnce the temperature point is reached, the whey goes through a time of draining in order to dry completely,\u201d she comments.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to produce in larger amounts and to sell at larger markets. She wants to buy dairy cattle to increase her production of artisan cheese. This is the first loan sequence with the institution in the 30 years she has been doing this activity. It is for these reasons that Francisca is asking for a loan to buy dairy cattle to increase and improve their cheese

Liberal Arts and Sciences. Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am the happiest student in the world, because I entered AUCA, the best university for me. For the person who has big ambitions, it is important to choose the best university that has a modern education system, well-equipped lab and library. However, the most important issue now is tuition payment. That\u2019s why I am requesting a Kiva loan.\r\n\r\n\"I have a big family of seven: my parents, my elder and younger sisters, two younger brothers and me. My father is the only breadwinner in our family. My two younger brothers go to the kindergarten, my younger sister goes to the school, and my elder sister is a student at one of the local universities. In addition to that, I am a freshman this year. It goes without saying that my family is having hard times, because my father has to pay for everything by himself. My mother used to work and help him, but after giving birth to my little brothers, she stays at home and maintains the household, as someone has to take care of them at home. My elder sister and I try to support my family and have a part-time job in summer, but for all that our earnings are enough just for our books and clothes. My family always saves money, but still seven members of my family are to live and spend money.\r\n\r\n\"I think that I can\u2019t make much for my family now, but will be able in the future, if I get a degree, to find a good job and being financially independent. I can give advice to them and help my other siblings to be educated. The big achievements and victories begin from small steps, and I am ready to step now. I thank Kiva lenders for your generosity and await your support.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1789966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Her business is in the locality of \u2018Llanquichapi,\u2019 characterized by is closeness to the sacred Lake Titicaca, an agricultural region where they raise livestock -- cattle, sheep and camelid -- and make their living fishing and also with grains and vegetables from the place, such as quinoa, freeze-dried potatoes, broad beans, potatoes, etc. It is characterized by its cold climate, with a temperature that varies during the day between 1-12 degrees centigrade and where the sun's rays hit the surface with a lot of force. \r\n\r\nElvira has tanned skin, is short, has long black hair she keeps braided, she dresses traditionally (hat, blanket and pollera [traditional Andean skirt]), her native language is Aymar\u00e1 and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for the business she does. She shares her live with her husband, who works in agriculture, and her younger child, who goes to school -- the older children are independent, they live in an adobe house with a corrugated iron roof that has electricity and well water.  Her business is fishing in a boat with a net. Fishing in Lake Titicaca is one of ways of fishing that is the most beautiful, traditional, and respectful of the lake and the lake bed, since the method of fishing is tossing a net line, which tends to be from 30 meters in length, into the lake. After letting the net fall to the depths and leaving it there for a day as a trap, and later simply collecting it, means it doesn't drag and destroy the lake bed, and only traps things of the size that is sought, according to the size of the net, and only fish the varieties that are wanted. \"The fish in Lake Titicaca are extremely tranquil, the coldness of the place freezes everything in its surroundings, we need to be fairly patient in our daily work...\" she says. Her dream is to have a fish market. She wants to purchase a fishing boat because the one she has is old and it doesn't provide the safety conditions she needs. This is her second loan cycle with the institution in the 22 years that she has been doing this work.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Elvira asks for a loan to purchase a fishing boat to fish with more security.

With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Shitu can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. When asked, Shitu  spoke of his ambition to use the additional income to educate his children, eventually hoping to ensure his children are educated and have professional jobs.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1635232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To pay for child school fees and uniforms, eliminating pressure to sell corn for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-12-26T01:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-09T01:10:05Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shitu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":40292,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":40292}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-26T03:08:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":819377,"name":"Oliva Del Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Oliva es una se\u00f1ora de 36 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera, se dedica a la ganader\u00eda ya que cuenta que tiene vacas lecheras y por medio del orde\u00f1o y venta de leche es como  obtiene sus ingresos para darles la educaci\u00f3n a sus hijos, ella tiene 3 hijos menores de edad que se encuentran estudiando, Oliva  necesita el cr\u00e9dito para compra una vaca y asi lograr mejorar la calidad de vida de sus hijos.","en":"Oliva is 36 years old, a single mother, who works raising animals and says that she has dairy cows and milking them and selling the milk is how she gets income to provide an education for her children.

Beatriz set up her sewing workshop with a lot of determination to generate profits so that she could cover expenses for the house where she lives with her mother. She learned this trade through a couple of courses, which allowed her to get some work and to be known for her good quality and punctuality in completing projects on time.\r\n\r\nThrough these jobs, Beatriz has been able to attract a large number of customers, which have provided her with good monthly sales. She hopes that her business continues growing so that she can eventually employ other people who are in great need of work.\r\n\r\nIn hoping to respond to her customers' needs, Beatriz is looking to secure a loan that will allow her to buy sewing supplies, like cloth, thread, needles, lace, buttons, etc. to stock her workshop.\r\n\r\nBeatriz hopes that her family will be able to enjoy an increase in income and consequently, an enhanced quality of life. Beatriz also hopes that her business will continue growing and that her workshop can provide a job for at least one person who needs work but who does not have many employment opportunities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1764918,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy sewing supplies, like cloth, thread, needles, lace, buttons, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-12-26T03:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-09T03:20:04Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.5,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.47,"local_amount":98821,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":102366.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611815712},{"amount":46.44,"local_amount":108765,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":112667.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.5,"payment_id":624865298},{"amount":51.89,"local_amount":115309,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":119446.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636622708},{"amount":51.78,"local_amount":115062,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":119190.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649596767},{"amount":477.92,"local_amount":1062043,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T12:55:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1100148.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665455982}],"funded_date":"2015-01-23T09:06:41Z","paid_date":"2015-06-18T12:55:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christina Mellace","image":1213464}},{"id":825925,"name":"Elena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elena is 51 years old and married with two children.
