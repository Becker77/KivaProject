The loan is critically important for Paola as it represents the start of an independent life and the opportunity to succeed as a businesswoman. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1765013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase ingredients, containers, chairs, and tables.

She is married and the mother of four children. After having received her teaching degree, she was not able to work with her profession, as the teacher salary was not enough even for the everyday expenses. Therefore she decided to start her own livestock breeding business. On a plot of land she inherited from her grandfather, Ihboldzhon started breeding livestock. \r\n\r\nCurrently Ihboldzhon has a large herd of cows, rams and sheep. Every morning her daughter helps her with milking the cows and bringing the milk to the market to sell. The sheep milk is highly appreciated by their customers due to its healing qualities. Ihboldzhon loves her herd and likes to work in the field with fresh air. She is almost never ill. \r\n\r\nNow she is planning to repair her house before the start of the winter, and she needs to purchase building material. However, she does not have enough money for realizing her plans. Therefore she turned to \"MDO Arvand\" for help. She hopes that \"MDO Arvand\" will give her the needed amount. Ihboldzhon is thankful that in different stages of her life, she is able to turn to \"MDO Arvand\", and she always gets help and

He is married and the happy father of five children and fifteen grandchildren. 45 years ago he dedicated his life to livestock breeding, working in the field and growing crops. Not once during this time he has complained about the cold or the scorching heat; he has worked at high temperatures and with blisters on his hands. He has worked hard because he understood that he is the breadwinner in the family and at home his wife and five children were waiting, needing food. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning Ermambet worked at a farm, but soon he started his own business. With his own money he purchased a plot of land on which he started breeding cattle. Currently he has a large herd: 20 rams and three cows. Reaching old age, he continued to work with his beloved business, and looks after the cattle with love and care.

She is married and the mother of four children. She grew up in a village and since childhood she has worked in the field, looking after cattle and growing crops. After getting married, she continued to work with livestock breeding. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning Ruzimo had only one cow. After a while she increased the number of livestock and currently she looks after five cows and seven rams on her own plot of land. Every morning Ruzimo's youngest daughter takes the milk she gets from milking the cows to the market to sell. Ruzimo and her husband work hard in order to raise their youngest daughter and give her an education, so that she will be able to live without knowing any need. \r\n\r\nRuzimo takes a loan in order to purchase livestock fodder for the winter, as she does not have the full amount herself. Therefore she turned to \"MDO Arvand\" for financial support. She hopes that \"MDO Arvand\" responds to her request for help and lends her the necessary amount.

Introducing Alice, a 62-year-old mother who is full of energy and a very hard worker. She hails from the Nyamira area of Kenya, an area with good and favorable weather patterns that support farming. \r\n\r\nAlice completed her secondary school education thanks to the financial support and effort of her parents, but never advanced. This never killed the spirit she has for succeeding in life. Alice has been farming for the past 25 years and through mixed farming, she has been able to take care of her family. She loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of her cows. \r\n\r\nAlthough Alice passionately loves farming, she faces the challenge of water shortages. Most of the rain water goes to waste, which is why she is seeking a loan to buy a water tank. Alice comes from an area where there is no piped water. Therefore this water tank will assist her to harvest water during the rainy seasons and also store water for home consumption. Harvested water will assist Alice to irrigate her farm, ensuring that there is a constant production of crops. This loan will turn around the life of Alice, as she will no longer have to walk for long distances in search of water, hence saving her time."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":558.51,"image":{"id":1790022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a water tank","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-10T13:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-09T13:50:07Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":110.25,"local_amount":9799.83,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":10046.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262741},{"amount":101.48,"local_amount":9020.32,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:12Z","rounded_local_amount":9247.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601111},{"amount":110.12,"local_amount":9921.89,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":10171.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.5,"payment_id":681377990},{"amount":109.6,"local_amount":10241.86,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":10499.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.62,"payment_id":711505971},{"amount":117.24,"local_amount":10661.04,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:35Z","rounded_local_amount":10929.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.7,"payment_id":752110979}],"funded_date":"2015-01-11T06:30:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":825946,"name":"Elsie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsie is 50 years old and married with six children, two of whom are in school.

Most of the people here work in agriculture and raising small animals because of its climate and geographical location which produces results on the crops of products from the Sierra Region. Its people do these activities from day-to-day. Although it is a place located far from the city, there are families devoted to all types of activities to meet their needs and those of their community.\r\n\r\nEdwin inherited from his parents the ability to raise and sell small animals such as chickens, pigs, calves, rabbits, etc. He has been doing this activity for three years and works from 8 to 10 hours each day in parallel with his household duties.\r\n\r\nHe feels ready to put the experience that he acquired through the years to use by increasing production so that he can improve his way of life and that of his family.\r\n\r\nEdwin and his family are grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternative and Kiva for making it possible for growth in his work and personal life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1790559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

He is 24 years old and the first born in a family of seven. Sylvester is requesting a loan to buy a Zoona branded booth and float loan to ensure that he has enough money to fulfill customer transactions. This will help him to provide financial services to people in his community.\r\n\r\nThe trading booth will be used to serve customers in Sylvester\u2019s community. Most of his customers are unbanked. Zoona has done market research in Sylvester\u2019s community and has determined that the location for this trading booth is ideal. He is one of the operators of Zoona mobile money transfers in town and a large number of families are already using his service. However, such a high demand for his service means that people must wait in long queues.

From 1997 to 2000, she worked for Seviose in Luanshya.\r\n\r\nThis is Sharon\u2019s first loan from Kiva, which she has requested so that she can purchase a Zoona branded trading booth to serve her customers. She does not have enough money to pay for the booth and has opted to get a Kiva loan. Sharon will use part of the money as a float to service customers who need to send and receive money from her booth. What Sharon likes most about her business is that it is helping her to interact with different people and that it is making a difference in her community. Her challenges include little working capital and network failures. But the benefits to the community, which include giving people an opportunity to send and receive money more easily, safely and quickly and to no longer have to walk long distances to transact, are immense and a big plus for her business.\r\n\r\nSharon's hopes for the future are to open up more outlets and to be able to provide reliable service to her customers. The proceeds from this expansion will help her to pay for her children\u2019s school fees and to afford a decent life for her family.   \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":71.86,"image":{"id":1759915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a Zoona branded trading booth and increase the money that she uses to serve her customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2014-12-26T15:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-09T15:20:13Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.03,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sharon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":9000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.47,"local_amount":223,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T18:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":225.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.46,"payment_id":696778321},{"amount":18.36,"local_amount":223,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":225.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.57,"payment_id":752302047}],"funded_date":"2014-12-29T23:38:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":819966,"name":"Erwing","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Erwing tiene 32 a\u00f1os, es conviviente, vive en casa de familiares junto a conviviente y 02 hijos y nieto.

Meet Margaret, 52 years of age and a very hard working, honest, and dedicated farmer. She lives in Mosobeti, a remote village in Nyamira. She is happily married and is blessed with 8 adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last 23 years and has gained so much experience. <br \/><br \/>To afford a decent and comfortable life for her large family, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in other small personal business. <br \/><br \/>The Nyamira area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting demand, which is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and that she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. <br \/><br \/>Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets. This will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":163.6,"image":{"id":1790073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-10T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-09T16:10:05Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.94,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.76,"local_amount":3445.24,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3532.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262744},{"amount":35.29,"local_amount":3137.19,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3216.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601114},{"amount":38.07,"local_amount":3430.17,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3516.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.52,"payment_id":681377992},{"amount":4.25,"local_amount":396.78,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":406.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.21,"payment_id":711505973},{"amount":24.94,"local_amount":2282.34,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2339.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.74,"payment_id":731022791},{"amount":20.35,"local_amount":1850.49,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1897.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.47,"payment_id":752110981}],"funded_date":"2015-01-17T17:27:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}},{"id":825986,"name":"Jocelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of two children, Jocelyn works hard to support her family.<br \/><br \/>She has a vegetable vending business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from a general store.

He has four children in total; one is single and lives under his support while the other three are married and live independently. To make a living and support his family, he manages and operates a rice farming business on farmland which is located near his house. He has been involved in this business since 1990. He is able to earn a daily income of USD 5 on average.\r\n\r\nChhorm would like to improve his living standards by having clean energy for household use. Because of his lack of capital, he is asking for a loan to build a biogas digester, under the project of NBP (National Biogas Program) in partnership with HKL. After an initial investment in this system, he hopes that he won\u2019t spend much money on fuel and will reduce smoke from wood or charcoal. \r\n\r\nHe is very happy and thankful, because with this kind of loan product, HKL has offered a better interest rate than for its general loans.

In this community, 5 CBO (Community Based Organization) members oversee a group of 18 village customers. This loan will help them purchase ducks as well as high quality feeds ($45 per packet and a week's feed for 100 ducks). When they eat the duck food and small fishes from the lake, 50% of the ducks on average lay eggs every day. As the price of the eggs always fluctuates, the income isn\u2019t always same for each household. \r\n\r\nKyon Thin Village has over 900 villagers and many of them are farmers. Some villagers have grocery stores at their home and they also raise ducks, pigs, and chickens as livestock. For additional income, villagers do fishing and sell at other nearby villages or towns.\r\n\r\nThe above pictures shows the CBO leaders from the Kyon Thin Village, named as U Toe, U That, U Win, Daw Myint and U Phoe. Included in the picture, U Toe (second from left) is 27 years old and he is married, having a daughter. He farms at his one-acre crop farm and take cares of their 150 ducks and 2 pigs.  His wife looks after the small grocery shop opened at their home and sometimes helps U Toe in farming. \r\n\r\nWith Proximity's loan, he will buy better feeds for the ducks to increase his egg output and thus income.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1790089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict

Eulalio desde hace 23 a\u00f1os, juntos han formado una familia con cuatro hijos de los cuales solo uno estudia su educaci\u00f3n secundaria, los dem\u00e1s ya son independientes. \n\nEulalia se dedica a la cr\u00eda y engorda de borregos desde hace 5 a\u00f1os. \u201cCuando se es madre tenemos la obligaci\u00f3n de darles lo mejor a nuestros hijos por eso mismo yo decid\u00ed iniciar mi propio negocio\u201d. En un principio, Eulalia solicit\u00f3 tres mil pesos (USD$ 206) a otra financiera, dinero que utiliz\u00f3 para comprar tres borreguitos, con el tiempo el n\u00famero de animales ha ido en aumento. Ahora, est\u00e1 planeando comprar siete borreguitos peque\u00f1os; normalmente los conserva durante todo un a\u00f1o para poder venderlos ya que han alcanzado un buen tama\u00f1o y peso. Do\u00f1a Eulalia les dedica m\u00e1s de cinco horas al d\u00eda, en las ma\u00f1anas los lleva al comedero, pero en las tardes debe sacarlos a pastar al campo. Los mejores clientes son personas que se dedican a preparar la carne para vender un platillo tradicional de la regi\u00f3n llamado \"barbacoa\". Eulalia est\u00e1 muy contenta con sus animalitos aunque ahora habr\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo porque tendr\u00e1 once; afortunadamente, cuando llegan a enfermar, ella misma los inyecta, su hijo que es veterinario fue quien le ense\u00f1\u00f3 a hacerlo. \n\nLa meta de Do\u00f1a Eulalia es poder seguir aumentando el n\u00famero de sus borregos aunque su mayor anhelo es que su hijo menor termine una carrera profesional. \u201cYo no estudi\u00e9 y aunque quisiera encontrar un trabajo mejor, no puedo porque no tengo los conocimientos suficientes y no me gustar\u00eda que mi hijo pasara por lo mismo\u201d coment\u00f3 Do\u00f1a Eulalia. En la comunidad donde viven los integrantes del grupo por lo regular los j\u00f3venes solo terminan la secundaria, pero los padres siempre tratan de esforzarse y convencerlos de que contin\u00faen prepar\u00e1ndose. \n\nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Juana M., Maria del Carmen, Patricia, Vicenta, Maricela, Juana S., Susana y Gregorio quienes tambi\u00e9n solicitaron un pr\u00e9stamo para invertirlo en su actividad que es la misma que do\u00f1a Eulalia.\n\n*La foto fue tomada en las escaleras del quisoco del Municipio, Do\u00f1a Eulalia es quien tiene el su\u00e9ter en color morado. Algunas de las integrantes muestran los bordados que elaboran ellas mismas para despu\u00e9s venderlas y obtener un ingreso extra.","en":"Eulalia is 44 years old and has been married to her husband Eulalio for 23 years. Together, they have formed a family with their four children. One son is in middle school. The others are independent.\r\n\r\nEulalia has bred and fattened sheep for 5 years. \u201cWe as mothers have an obligation to give our children the best. For this reason, I decided to start my own business.\u201d Initially, Eulalia requested 3 thousand pesos (USD $206) from another financial organization. She used this loan to buy three lambs. Over time, the number of animals she has has increased. Now, she is planning to buy seven small lambs that she normally raises for a year and sells after they reach a good size and weight. Eulalia works with her lambs more than 5 hours a day. In the morning, she leads them to their feed but she lets them out to graze in the evenings. Her best customers are people who prepare meat to sell a traditional dish of the region called barbacoa [barbeque]. Eulalia is very happy with her animals but now there will be more work with 11 lambs. Fortunately, when they get sick she can give them injections because her son who is a vet taught her how to do so.\r\n\r\nEulalia\u2019s goal is to continue increasing the number of sheep although her greater wish is that her youngest child completes his studies. \u201cI did not study and if I wanted to find a better job I cannot because I do not have enough knowledge. I do not want my son to go through the same,\u201d said Eulalia. In the community where the group members live, usually only young people finish middle school but parents try to convince them continue studying. \r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are Juana M, Maria del Carmen, Patricia, Vicenta, Maricela, Juana S., Susana, and Gregorio who also applied for a loan to invest in their economic activities similar to Eulalia.\r\n\r\n*The photo was taken on the Steps of Quisoco in their municipality. Eulalia has a purple sweater. Some of the members show the embroideries that they make and sell themselves for extra income.

She was also able to start selling vegetables in their area.\r\n\r\nShe would now like to apply for a 51,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy large quantities of grocery items like rice, pasta, soda, rice noodles and processed meat which she sells at retail. Part of the loan she will use to buy different kinds of vegetables from a wholesaler's farm to sell. She expects a much higher demand for grocery items and vegetables this Christmas season. She is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment and the financial help that will be given her. \r\n\r\nMercidita dreams of having a big grocery store someday to serve more customers. She aims to give her children the best education possible in order for them to have a better future. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies.\r\n\r\n *All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital  and repay microfinance

She has been married to Carlos for 17 years and they have created a family with three children who are studying in college, high school, and elementary school, respectively. \r\n\r\nWhen they got married, Carlos and Eva had two small sewing machines. Back then, they only made pants and t-shirts, which they would sell in the streets, plazas, and street markets. One day, a professor hired them to make sports uniforms for the rest of the teachers in the school. Smiling, Eva commented, \u201cTo me, they were really ugly, but the teacher liked our work a lot and she placed another order.\u201d\r\n\r\nLittle by little, the number of customers grew, but Eva and Carlos knew that the quality of their work had to improve. That is when VisionFund gave them their first loan to buy an industrial machine. They paid back the loan, but they still needed more machinery and they continued requesting the support. This time, they will buy fabric, thread, and zippers. They are very thankful for the loans they have been given because they have been able to buy machines and materials that have allowed them to continue growing. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the couple makes school uniforms, pants, t-shirts, skirts, sweaters, etc. They already have regular customers \u2013 people who, year after year, place important orders for the schools. In August and September, their work increases and this is when Eva hires two additional seamstresses to help with the orders. Since she has never liked to displease her customers, she has always been very punctual in her deliveries. \r\n\r\nEva\u2019s dream is to establish a sewing shop in the municipality. She believes that if she installs her workshop she will be able to increase her earnings and give more work to other women. Her one difficulty is the lack of money to buy more machines and launch the business, but she never loses hope in being able to succeed. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are: Antonio, who is investing in his blacksmith shop; Juana, who is investing in lambs; Ang\u00e9lica, who is investing in rent for a mill; and Diana, who is investing in a small artisanal shop. \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in the stairs underneath the municipality\u2019s pavilion.

Meet Grace, a 58-year-old farmer from a remote village in Bonyamatuta in the Nyamira area of Kenya. She resides with her husband, with whom she is blessed with five children. <br \/><br \/>Grace has been actively involved in farming for the last 35 years and has never regretted it or looked back. She practices mixed farming, and sells milk, eggs and various food crops at the local market. She passionately loves poultry farming, but the biggest challenge she is facing is a lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. She is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. She believes the excess maize she has will be used in feeding the poultry, sorghum will be used in giving the poultry energy, and green grams (mung beans) for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production, and will lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate to more income. Apart from an increase in egg output, she will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will increase her income and profit margins. <br \/><br \/>Through her increased profits, she is going to turn around her living conditions and live a better life.
