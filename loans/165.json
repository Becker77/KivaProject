It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mary plans to buy cassava and potatoes for farming, manure to fertilize her fields, corn and pineapple. Mary also intends to purchase piglets and chickens. These animals can be useful as an investment and also as fertilizer for one\u2019s farm. Lastly, Mary will buy some small garage tools. \r\n<p>\r\nMary has been a farmer for many years and has experience using loans to fund her farm business. This is Mary\u2019s fourth loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2005. She knows from her past experience that she can take on a loan of this size and be successful. \r\n<p>\r\nBefore she joined GHAPE, her life was very difficult. Her father passed when she was only 13, ending her education. She says she was forced to marry early and since then has lost her husband to a protracted illness leaving her to support her eight children. Mary was \u201cfinancially not okay,\u201d as she could not cover basic needs. \r\n<p>\r\nMary is a GHAPE member because \u201cGHAPE\u2026empowers the poor\u201d and \u201chas trained me and equipped me with prosperous knowledge.\u201d After being with GHAPE for three years, she has \u201cdiscovered the benefits of being a GHAPE member.\u201d\r\n<p>\r\nWith the profits from this loan she will pay for her children\u2019s school fees, provide the best for her children and finish the housing projects her husband left behind. She also wants to save a reasonable percentage in her GHAPE savings account. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nGrounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and a strong bond of trust has developed between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":331014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"For cassava, potatoes, manure, corn, pineapples, pigs, chickens and garage tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Mile 90, Bamenda, N.W.

She is 44 years old, married, and has six school-aged children. To make a living, Pablita owns and operates a service-based business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing transport services to local community members. Pablita has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Pablita joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase materials needed to expand the services she provides. Pablita is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This loan will be her third from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support her children's education. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Together they work with great determination so their only son, Miguel, will lack nothing. \r\n\r\nFor more than 20 years she has worked to provide a good quality of life to her only son. To that end she sells ice cream during the day and sweets in the evenings from a small sales location and while walking around. Her partner works as a motorcycle taxi driver, using a vehicle he bought through a lot of effort. With the income they both earn they are able to cover the household expenses and the education of their son. At the same time they are saving for the future so they can use the money in a project such as building their own house or to buy another moto-vehicle that would help them earn greater income. \r\n\r\nWhat Carmen likes the most is attending to her clients in a careful manner. However, it bothers her to have to work until the late hours of the night, which is tiring, even though it is worth the effort since the business is profitable and allows them to live  without economic worries. This is her sixth loan with MFP and she is very happy working with her communal group where she receives educational talks that help her carefully use the loans she receives. \r\n\r\nWith this request for 3000 soles she will buy another moto-vehicle and rent it daily, which will assure them of  benefiting economically.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva

She only received 45 minutes worth of instruction at a time though as her neighbor's husband got annoyed if he found her in his house.\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of the bad treatment which she received in learning her traD., after a couple of weeks she had learned all she needed to in order to set up her business and now she no longer has just 3 meters of fabric and 10 rods but rolls of fabric and more than 100 kg of rods.

She lives in her own home in Pomalco district, in the rural part of Chiclayo, the capital of Lambayeque region.\r\n\r\nFor three years, Raquel has been raising and selling animals.  She carries out this business activity on a plot of land near her home.  She raises the animals until they reach a good size and weight, then she sells them in the local market.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mobile phones have inundated the market, and this compelled her to close up her business and start off in poultry farming, which proved to be very profitable. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately her only daughter, who just brilliantly clinched her high school diploma, has died having drowned in an Olympic swimming pool. Traumatized, she is no longer able to take care of things; worse, she fractured her ankle. Misfortune never travels alone; her son will have his leg amputated due to a chronic tumor.

Concepcion has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Concepcion joined ASKI to gain access to their financial services. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI which she used to buy additional products to sell, this will be the fourth loan taken out by Concepcion from ASKI.

It has 25 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and -women, and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The communal bank is in its second loan cycle, and is made up of 10 individuals.  The bank was founded by a group of women on November 17, 2009.\r\n\r\nThe communal bank\u2019s president is Yina, the treasurer is Yorgina, and the secretary is M\u00f3nica.  Most of the women in the group make a living selling cosmetics, clothing, food, or groceries; working as seamstresses; providing transportation; or in other activities.  The group meets at 2:00 PM on Tuesdays at Yina\u2019s house.  The new members who have joined are happy to work with Emprender, since they learned during the Reto\u00f1o 2009 Communal Bank\u2019s training about the projected savings at the end of the loan cycle.  As they work with the communal bank they will learn to save and to share with their friends every 14 days.\r\n\r\nYina (the president) sells cosmetics as a street vendor.

Julio's farmland is located in the province of La Mar-Ayacucho, Peru. His lands are expansive and the care he provides has made them one of the best crops in the area. It's for this reason that when he goes to sell his coffee, cocoa and cocoa leaves in the city of San Francisco he obtains very good prices due to the quality of the products. What he enjoys most about his work is sowing his lands and making them fertile. He has been doing this activity of 32 years and considers the most difficult task to be keeping his crops safe from plagues. With time, he wants to purchase more lands in other areas so he can increase his products and add more variety of products. This is his 16th loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he knows that he has to pay on time if he wants to be granted more loans in the future.

Along with this business, he sells freezers and refrigerators, both new and second-hand.\r\nWith the approach of the hot season, during which there is greater demand for freezers, he decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso (one of Kiva's field partners). He is on his first loan, which he intends to use to buy 2 freezers. He gets his supplies in Gao.\r\nMr. Cheick Ahamed Tidiane T. sells his goods in cash and on credit to a clientele composed of men and women.\r\nHe intends to realize a monthly profit of 75,000 FCFA, which will serve to repay his loan and to pay a portion of his daily expenses. His goal is to further develop his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":714617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy freezers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cheick Ahamed Tidiane ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":42240.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201361236},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:19Z","rounded_local_amount":42240.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226516},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":42240.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301358},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":42240.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580929},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:10Z","rounded_local_amount":42240.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750754},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":42240.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120069}],"funded_date":"2011-03-04T19:42:14Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":278480,"name":"Abdoulaye","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Abdoulaye C. est un homme mari\u00e9 de 26 ans et p\u00e8re d\u2019un enfant qui vit avec sa femme et son enfant chez son p\u00e8re, \u00e0 Bougouni dans le quartier Massablacoura.\nAyant vite abandonn\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9cole, il d\u00e9cida d\u2019apprendre le m\u00e9tier de tailleur aupr\u00e8s de son oncle.\nDe nos jours, Abdoulaye a 12 ann\u00e9es d\u2019exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine qu\u2019il ma\u00eetrise bien et dans lequel il est tr\u00e8s sollicit\u00e9 et appr\u00e9ci\u00e9.\nPour renforcer ses activit\u00e9s, il d\u00e9cida d\u2019int\u00e9grer le programme de cr\u00e9dit de Soro Yiriwaso, avec qui il est \u00e0 sa premi\u00e8re exp\u00e9rience.\nAvec ce pr\u00eat il compte acheter des tissus pour les coudre et les vendre \u00e0 des particuliers et aux commer\u00e7ants.\nIl s\u2019approvisionne \u00e0 Bamako aupr\u00e8s des grossistes. \nIl compte r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice mensuel 35 000 FCFA.\nAvec ce b\u00e9n\u00e9fice il compte am\u00e9liorer son atelier afin d\u2019attirer plus de clients et contribuer aux d\u00e9penses de la famille.\n","en":"Mr. Abdoulaye C. is 26, married and the father of one child.

Father\u2019s Day is approaching and she is preparing merchandise for this season.

The quality of their products and the good service they offer has allowed them to quickly increase their clientele.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

of Fana (2nd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\u00a0 He quickly dropped out of school to pursue income-generating work, particularly commerce in a variety of goods.\u00a0 He became specialized in buying and selling the ingredients for making traditional soaps.\u00a0 He is in high demand and enjoys great fame in and around Fana City.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nConcerned about satisfying further his burgeoning customer base, Mamadou decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is now on his second individual loan after having properly repaid the first one.\u00a0 He intends to use this loan for buying barrels of caustic soda and containers of red palm oil.\u00a0 He gets his supplies in Bamako (capital of Mali) in order to come and sell them in his shop located at the big market in Fana.\u00a0 Cash and often credit are accepted from customers composed of makers of traditional soaps called \"Gabakourouni\u2019\u2019.\r\n\r\nMamadou hopes to make an average monthly profit of 80,000 francs CFA that will be used for family expenses.\u00a0 The rest will be invested into the business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

the needs of her family. It was financed by a loan she requested from ASHI, of which she has been a member since 2008. Though all of her children have their own families now, Nenita still has to work hard and maintain her business because she is the sole provider for her unemployed husband and 77 year-old father. Her business currently provides only a small revenue, but Nenita enjoys spending it on her family\u2019s most immediate needs, and would not want to stop growing her business until it becomes stable and profitable through loans. Though Nenita\u2019s store only sells a few varieties of goods and grocery items at the moment, she envisions someday selling huge volumes of commodities and

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her small business has been operating since 1986, the predominant activity being buying tomatoes in bulk from Chwele and then reselling them to vendors and individual families in Myanga.<p>On a market day, which occurs twice a week, Rita sells about 4 crates of tomatoes at a profit of 300 Kenya Schillings each (about 4.6 US Dollars).  Vendors place their orders beforehand, and then Rita buys from her supplier accordingly. On non-market days Rita sells mostly retail, and can make a profit of about 100 Kenya Schillings from all of her products.<p>One challenge that her business currently faces is that on market days, she has no tomatoes left over after selling to vendors. Consequently, she cannot meet the demand from individual families who wish to make purchases in smaller quantities. Rita hopes to address this obstacle with a Kiva loan, which she would invest in increasing her stock of tomatoes, as well as onions and fish.<p>Rita is confident that there would be demand to meet the increased stock from her loan.

She lives alone in the house that her parents left her and feels that now is the time to improve her life.  Even at 19, she knew that working hard was the only way to get ahead so she decided to help her parents with the family business and learn to weave and make local crafts.  Now, with 5 years experience, she has her own crafts business.  She sells her products on the esplanade at Laguna Temporal (where the local market at Juliaca is sited).  She's a persuasive and friendly saleswoman and, consequently, she has a lot of regular customers.  She hopes to have an exclusive shop selling local crafts because she likes weaving and especially the art that goes into her products.  The only difficult thing about her business is moving her goods to the place where she sells them, a big expense for her.  Despite everything, Yaneth is happy and wants a better future, something she knows she will get with hard work.  This is Yaneth's second MFP loan and she believes she will repay it on time, just like she did the last one.  She didn't miss a single payment.  She's very dear to her community bank and has the support of all its members because, after all, she's still a very young woman.  With this money, she will add to her working capital.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Kamala expresses her gratitude to everyone supporting her and promises to repay the loan on time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":596474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cattle and six sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Imishli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.869722 48.06","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2010-09-08T21:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kamala ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":189.04,"local_amount":151.23,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-24T08:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":151.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172066590},{"amount":23.8,"local_amount":19.04,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-02T10:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":19.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177881075},{"amount":105.41,"local_amount":84.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-22T09:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":84.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182802620},{"amount":99.68,"local_amount":79.74,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:23:01Z","rounded_local_amount":80.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189113568},{"amount":217.01,"local_amount":173.61,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T22:35:40Z","rounded_local_amount":174.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191532641},{"amount":97.7,"local_amount":78.16,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:46:45Z","rounded_local_amount":78.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201229674},{"amount":102.71,"local_amount":82.17,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-17T07:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":82.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206372452},{"amount":104.64,"local_amount":83.71,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-22T07:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":84.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212093046},{"amount":103.93,"local_amount":83.14,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":83.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216449706},{"amount":206.08,"local_amount":164.87,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:14:45Z","rounded_local_amount":165.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221613831}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T15:59:31Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:14:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":233435,"name":"Josefelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In 2000, Josefelia G. found an opportunity to acquire business capital. She joined ASHI and was inspired by the stories she heard of other poor women. She wanted to become successful like them so because of this opportunity, Josefelia was able to start a fishing business.  She has taken all the risk of running a business; she thought she could be successful because her husband is there to support her and because of a dream of having all her children graduate from college.\r\n\r\nJosefelia hopes that her children never have to experience the hard life she and her husband had . She dreams of increased space for her fishing equipment and an expanded fishing business.  Josefelia\u2019s main challenge has been having a small stock due to the hindrances of small working capital to put into her fishing business. Therefore, Josefelia needs a larger loan to expand her fishing business. The fish her husband catches are sold by Josefelia in their village and to people selling fish in the market. She thinks that commercializing her fishing business and expanding it will enable her to earn more revenue and be able to pay school fees for her children and provide for other family needs. Josefelia\u2019s wish to give her children a brighter future fuels her commitment to her fishing business. \r\n\r\nWith all of her plans for the growth of her business, Josefelia would be happy if her children are able to achieve their personal dreams and have a life free of poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":605119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She studied up to the third grade of elementary school.  She\u2019s married and has 7 children: Salustio, 42, Antonia, 40, Lucio, 38, Fidel, 36, V\u00edctor, 34, Mar\u00eda Enriqueta, 32 and Victoria, 30.  All of them work.\r\n\r\nMarta has a computer service business called Ciber Queta and she also has a sewing workshop.  She requested the loan to service the machines and to buy thread, needles, oil and scissors.  She also needs part of it for food for the household.  She sells candy and computer services to her customers.\r\n\r\nShe started the business 7 years ago and it\u2019s her son\u2019s but she tends to it.  With respect to the sewing: she first learned ironing and then sewing.  She used to make aprons to sell.  She has three industrial sewing machines in her workshop.  At first, she used a borrowed machine that she got from the \u201cmaquilero\u201d (person who assembles clothing for third parties).  Later on, as she did more and more clothing assembly jobs, she saved up and bought a sewing machine and then another two.  Her business is in her house.\r\n\r\nHer business is important to her because she earns income.  Her favorite part of the business is sewing and sewing gives her much satisfaction.  She remembers proudly when she got her first machine that allowed her to expand her business.  Her customers are different people because she goes out to sell her items.  Her business is popular and she\u2019s also well known thanks to the computers, or the Cyber, and zipper repairs.  She is planning to expand buying more fabric to have merchandise to work with.  She plans to accomplish this either with savings or with the loan.\r\n\r\nHer business faces competition from other people who do the same thing.  She uses profits from the business for food.  She is very happy with the loan she\u2019s getting because it will help her in business buying merchandise and providing working capital.  Her dreams and aspirations are to stay in business and to be able to share what the business produces with her children. Tlayecac is a very beautiful place.  She has been living in this town for many years.  It is very peaceful.\r\n\r\nMarta wants to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad:  \u201cThank you very much for the loan and continue to help people who need it for their own and their families\u2019 wellbeing.  With this help the businesses continue working.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":665204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":" To service the machines and to buy thread, needles, oil and scissors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TLAYECAC MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-14T19:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":21.88,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:34Z","rounded_local_amount":271.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691532},{"amount":21.87,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":271.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430723},{"amount":21.88,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":271.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430724},{"amount":21.87,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:48Z","rounded_local_amount":271.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430725},{"amount":52.01,"local_amount":594.38,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":645.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195849990},{"amount":35.49,"local_amount":405.62,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":440.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292262}],"funded_date":"2010-12-14T21:40:47Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":262124,"name":"Gregoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gregoria tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera y reside junto a su familia en el caser\u00edo Punto Nueve del distrito de Mochum\u00ed, una zona netamente agr\u00edcola que se encuentra situada en la provincia de Lambayeque, a m\u00e1s de media hora  de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nSe dedica a la comercializaci\u00f3n de diversos productos en una bodega instalada en su domicilio, all\u00ed ofrece a sus vecinos diversos productos de uso diario entre productos de uso diario y abarrotes.

Alejandro D. and his family recently bought a party accessory business in their home town of El Paso.  They renamed the store Pi\u00f1ata Land, emphasizing the colorful variety of pi\u00f1atas they offer.  \r\n\r\nThe idea of owning a store specializing in pi\u00f1atas first presented itself when Alejandro\u2019s sister-in-law, who was working at the party accessory store at the time, discovered her employers\u2019 intention to sell the business.  After Alejandro and his family decided they wanted to purchase the business, they approached the store\u2019s former owners with an offer contingent upon financing.  Alejandro needed this financing quickly, before the owners moved on to other interested buyers.  With a loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana, they were able to purchase the store, including the store\u2019s equipment and remaining inventory.\r\n\r\nPi\u00f1ata Land is a true family-owned and operated business, consisting of Alejandro, his wife, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law.  Alejandro\u2019s wife and sister-in-law run the storefront and day-to-day operations, while Alejandro and his brother-in-law balance full-time jobs with managing Pi\u00f1ata Land finances.  Alejandro and his wife handle all of this in addition to raising two small children (ages 3 and 4).  The kids have adapted to their parents' constantly being at work because, as Alejandro explains, \u201cwe bring them with us (to the store)\u2026 they like being there.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlejandro hopes to eventually expand Pi\u00f1ata Land into a catering business, possibly also opening a second storefront.  For now though, he and his family are focused on strengthening their inventory to sell party accessories.   They are off to a good start.  \u201cJanuary is traditionally a slow month, but so far sales are better than

juice, and various local fruits.  On Saturdays she barbecues chicken, for which she sells tickets in advance.  Lloyda either sells her goods from her home or from a small stand in front of her sister-in-law's home on the main road.  Lloyda's neighbors know what she sells, so she has a number of regular customers.    \r\n\r\nLloyda is 32 years old and lives with her partner, who is a painter.  They have two children, 14 and 2.  Lloyda has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for about two years and used her first loan of 300 soles (about $100) to invest in candy for sale.  She still continues to sell candy on occasion, but has since diversified into the sale of other items.  Lloyda plans to invest this loan of 1000 soles in more of the various goods that she sells.\r\n\r\nLloyda feels that her loans from Manuela Ramos have helped her business.

She is a widow with one child who attends school. Justine covers the various family expenses herself. She has never been to school. For almost 25 years Justine has had a business selling fabric through the distribution system. This activity generates income which helps her to provide for her various needs. She buys her fabric in Lom\u00e9 in Togo, as well as in Nigeria, both of these countries bordering on B\u00e9nin.

He lives with his family in Sanabougou I, Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nHe has been a retailer of ready-to-wear clothing for the past four years, after unsuccessfully trying his hand at different activities. Given the increasing number of customers and his inability to meet their expectations using his own resources, he found it useful to approach the Soro Yiriwaso MFI to request a first personal loan.\r\n\r\nThe loan will enable him to buy clothes of varying quality: 10 shirts, 15 slacks, 20 pairs of shoes (Soulier and Ferardine brands), 4 vests, 10 T-shirts, etc. He resupplies in Bamako and resells his products in his shop located at the very centre of the Sikasso bus station, mainly to a customer base of travellers and drivers.\r\n\r\nWith this first loan he hopes to reach average monthly earnings of  120,000 FCFA. This will enable him to increase his working capital but also honour his commitments to Soro Yiriwaso and cover other family expenses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":596496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy clothing (shirts, slacks, T-shirts, shoes, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malik ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":85393.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476837},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":85393.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751978},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:00Z","rounded_local_amount":85393.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917903},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:26Z","rounded_local_amount":85393.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226174},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":85393.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580709},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:39Z","rounded_local_amount":85393.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120005}],"funded_date":"2010-10-08T08:40:14Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":233451,"name":"Mrs. Bou Mach Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Bou M. was selected as the leader of a group of thirteen people in Tboung Damrei village in Takeo province seeking a loan.

His greatest desire is to continue growing as a business owner in order to provide his family with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":624819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase feed for his animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Monsef\u00fa - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-10-26T03:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":69.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":70.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":75.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":75.98},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":78.51},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83.18},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83.9},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":86.21},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":90.4},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":92.9},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":95.49},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":98.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.21},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.29},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.49},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.2},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.9},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.83},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.21,"local_amount":69.88,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":73.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177555236},{"amount":26.29,"local_amount":70.12,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":73.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530648},{"amount":28.25,"local_amount":75.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":78.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666756},{"amount":28.49,"local_amount":75.98,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":79.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191410089},{"amount":29.44,"local_amount":78.51,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":82.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108516},{"amount":31.2,"local_amount":83.18,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":86.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270659},{"amount":31.46,"local_amount":83.9,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":87.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206137314},{"amount":32.33,"local_amount":86.21,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":90.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211209832},{"amount":33.9,"local_amount":90.4,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:56:02Z","rounded_local_amount":94.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216488185},{"amount":34.83,"local_amount":92.9,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":97.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222204514},{"amount":72.6,"local_amount":193.59,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":202.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227181241}],"funded_date":"2010-10-26T21:12:30Z","paid_date":"2011-09-16T08:02:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":245751,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan M. is a married woman who lives in Purok 4, Barangay Fatima, Santa Catalina, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a fishing  business.  Her husband, Raul M., who is 57 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are 8 to 23 years old. \r\n\r\nSusan joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Susan has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 25,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $238, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy fishing gear and pay for maintenance on her pump boat so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Susan M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the  NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

She and her son own a small precision glass-cutting and dicing workshop located in downtown Ivano-Frankivsk. Close proximity to busy train and bus stations makes this a very favorable location for business growth. Danina and her son use both thermal and score and break methods in their work to cut glass that is used in a variety of applications. They have about $4,000 of working capital in the business and their monthly gross revenue amounts to $1,000. \r\n\r\nDanina has been working in this business for 10 years. Originally, she started her entrepreneurial activity as a grocery retailer. However, later she joined her son in operating their glass-cutting and dicing workshop. Hard-work and tenacity have helped this family enterprise reach sustainability and success. \r\n\r\nDanina would like to get a loan for $1,200 to buy sheets of glass which are 3mm or less in thickness for her workshop. The extra supply of glass will help her and her son produce more material for architectural and design applications, as well as for tile, signage and lighting uses. Danina is hoping that increased sales activity will generate the necessary funds to sustain their business as well as to meet her family\u2019s needs.
