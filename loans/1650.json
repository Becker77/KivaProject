She is married to Jayson, a security guard, and has two children, of which one is in the Preparatory level and the other one is not of school age yet. She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal household needs and to send her child to school. \r\n\r\nWinnie is a dealer of soft drinks and a rice retailer as well. She buys them from a wholesaler and sells them at a retail price at her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 800 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan which she will use to buy sacks of rice and soft drinks to sell by her house. Rice is a staple in a Filipino household and soft drinks are also regularly taken in meals. She expects higher sales now that Christmas is just around the corner. She is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment and the financial help that will be given to her.\r\n\r\nWinnie Jane hopes to maintain and grow her business so she they could have a better life. She strives hard to send her child to school and prays for a quiet and happy married life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1763842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy sacks of rice and cases of soft drinks to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-12-26T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-09T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Winnie Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:52:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2009.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134599},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2679,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757390},{"amount":45,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2009.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200528},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2678.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186810},{"amount":15,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":669.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535842}],"funded_date":"2014-12-26T22:11:21Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miranda A","image":984688}},{"id":819304,"name":"Norma Angelica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Norma payed her first loan on time and now is asking for a new loan to buy blankets, cover sheets and clothes to sell through catalog.

llamado \u201cLas Artesanas del Fresno\u201d haciendo referencia a que cinco de ellas se dedican a la elaboraci\u00f3n de bordados artesanales, es una tradici\u00f3n que proviene de generaciones pasadas y que anteriormente se realizaba por gusto, actualmente, se ha convertido tambi\u00e9n en un medio de subsistencia.\n\nDo\u00f1a Porfiria es una persona muy seria pero muy amable, ella tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad y est\u00e1 casada desde hace 20 con el se\u00f1or Maximino quien trabaja en la construcci\u00f3n de casas, juntos han formado una familia con cuatro hijos de los cuales tres de ellos estudian y la m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a a\u00fan no asiste a la escuela.\n\nDesde peque\u00f1a, Porfiria observaba a su abuela elaborar sus bordados artesanales, cada figura de la prenda tiene un toque mazahua, cultura ind\u00edgena del lugar que representa a\u00f1os de tradiciones. Hace 20 a\u00f1os Porfiria hizo de esta actividad su negocio para ayudar con los gastos del hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos, pero necesita apoyo para comprar material como tela, agujas, hilo y estambre que transforma en colchas, su\u00e9teres, chalecos y rebozos que vende en distintas comunidades. Los dise\u00f1os y la combinaci\u00f3n de colores surgen con su creatividad.\n\nPorfiria menciona que la mayor\u00eda de las mujeres en comunidad elaboran las mismas artesan\u00edas y puede resultar complicado vender, en ocasiones ha tenido que bajar los precios para obtener alguna ganancia durante el d\u00eda. \u201cEs muy triste saber que muchas personas no valoren nuestro trabajo, deben saber que nosotras mismas lo elaboramos\u201d. Sin embargo, sabe que debe mejorar la calidad de las piezas y dejar volar la creatividad para tener m\u00e1s dise\u00f1os porque su sue\u00f1o es seguir creciendo para apoyar a sus hijos en los gastos de su educaci\u00f3n y logren terminar una carrera profesional.\n\nLas integrantes est\u00e1n muy contentas y agradecidas con KIVA y VisionFund porque su pr\u00e9stamo ayudar\u00e1 a mejorar sus negocios. Do\u00f1a Angelina, Zenaida, Ma Luisa y Ma Alejandra comprar\u00e1n materia prima para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus bordados artesanales, Jhynalin y Manuela invertir\u00e1n en productos de belleza.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue capturada en las escaleras debajo del quiosco del municipio y muestran algunas de sus artesan\u00edas. Porfiria es quien viste de color rosa.*\n","en":"In a community in the State of Mexico, the communal bank \" Las Artesanas del Fresno\u201d  was  formed.  Their name makes reference to the fact that 5 of them work making handmade embroidered items.  This is tradition that comes from past generations, which previously was done for enjoyment.  Now, this has become a means of earning a living.\r\n\r\nPorfiria is a very serious person who is also very friendly.  She's 39 years old, and has been married since she was 20 to Maximino, who works building houses.  Together they created a family with 4 children, 3 of whom are in school.  The youngest is not yet old enough to attend school.\r\n\r\nFrom the time she was very young, Porfiria  used to watch her grandmother make handmade embroidered items, where every shape on the garment had a Manzahua touch.  This is the indigenous culture in this place, representing years of traditions.  Twenty years ago, Porfiria started doing this activity as a business to help with the household expenses and the education of her children.  However, she needs support to buy supplies such as fabric, needles, thread, and yarn to transform into quilts, sweaters, jackets, and shawls that she sells in various communities.  The designs and color combinations come from her own creativity.\r\n\r\nPorfiria mentions that most of the women in her community make the same handicrafts, and so this can make it difficult to sell.  At times, she has had to lower her prices in order to obtain some earnings during the day.  \"It is very sad to know that many people do not value our work, they should know that we make these items ourselves.\"  However, she knows that she must improve the quality of her pieces, and let her creativity flow so that she can create more designs, because her dream is to continue to grow her business to support her children with their educational expenses so that they can get a professional degree.  \r\n\r\nThe members of this group are very content and thankful to Kiva and VisionFund, because this loan will help them to improve their businesses.  Angelina, Zenaida, Ma Luisa and Ma Alejandra will buy raw materials to make their embroidered handicrafts, and Jhynalin and Manuela will invest in beauty products to sell. \r\n\r\nNote:  this photograph was taken on the steps below the municipal gazebo, and shows some of our artisans.  Porfiria is the one wearing pink.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":1763932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase raw materials like fabric, needles, threads, and yarn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-26T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-09T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenaida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ma Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Porfiria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhynalin Lineth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":32000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":12076.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980692},{"amount":550,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":8050.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423844},{"amount":550,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:51Z","rounded_local_amount":8050.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769175},{"amount":275,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4025.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649763936}],"funded_date":"2014-12-26T22:20:56Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":819342,"name":"Vineta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vineta is a 27-year-old mother of 4 children.

Married to Marlon, a sprayman, and she has two children. One is in high school and the other one in elementary level. She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs, and to send her children to school. \r\n\r\nMonica operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of Php 400 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as snacks, pasta, noodles, powdered milk and chocolate drink, cereals, and other grocery stuff. She expects a higher demand for grocery items this Christmas season. She is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment, and the financial help that will be given her for it will be a big help to support their daily needs and school needs of her children.\r\n\r\nMonica dreams to have a big grocery store someday. She strives hard to give her children the best education possible, and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1763541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items, beverages and toiletries to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-12-26T22:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-09T22:10:04Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:52:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2009.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134600},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2679,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757391},{"amount":45,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2009.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200529},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2678.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186811},{"amount":15,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":669.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535843}],"funded_date":"2014-12-26T23:30:51Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":826151,"name":"Sajida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sajida is 40 years old, a married woman and a mother of 4 children.

They practice small trade selling bananas, oranges, fish, lettuce, carrots, plantains and potatoes. \r\n\r\nTo bolster their working capital, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso micro-finance organization. This is their 4th group loan cycle. \r\n\r\nMrs. Fatoumata (standing at the far left in the group photo) is a major reseller of bananas. She plans to use her loan to buy 4 baskets of bananas wholesale in M\u00e9dine. She retails her stock as an itinerant vendor in Dj\u00e9libougou to a mixed clientele.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mrs. Fatoumata expects to earn an average monthly profit of 150,000FCFA, which she will use to provide for her household and to reinvest in her activities. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3375,"image":{"id":1753646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy bananas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-12-26T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-09T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":3375,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":61.5,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimata               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mafoun\u00e8               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramata              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:38:48Z","rounded_local_amount":300123.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595319466},{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:06:51Z","rounded_local_amount":300123.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610753252},{"amount":528.31,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:45:37Z","rounded_local_amount":300123.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":34.19,"payment_id":624542972},{"amount":535.19,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":300123.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.31,"payment_id":636515986},{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-26T12:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":300123.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649788283},{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-07T12:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":300123.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":668301083}],"funded_date":"2014-12-27T17:41:03Z","paid_date":"2015-07-07T12:10:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":826150,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine is a 48-year-old lady married to Thomas and blessed with four children who are all adults.

Valley region of Kenya. Musa owns a 2-acre farm. On the farm, he practices mixed farming. The kind father keeps dairy animals and grows varieties of crops and vegetables. He has 10 years of experience in farming. \r\n\r\nMusa is seeking a loan to expand his horticulture farm. He is very hardworking and determined to increase his farm's output. Loans for smallholder farmers with little irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Musa. \r\n\r\nThrough a group of 10 members called S.S.G self-help group, Musa has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Musa because the institution believes that smallholder farmers too are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":372.08,"image":{"id":1790264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To expand his horticulture farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-10T22:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-09T22:50:04Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.22,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Musa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.5,"local_amount":6533.22,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6697.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262748},{"amount":34,"local_amount":3021.93,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3098.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264948},{"amount":33.66,"local_amount":2991.62,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3066.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601118},{"amount":36.58,"local_amount":3251.17,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3333.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459582},{"amount":36.82,"local_amount":3317.57,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3401.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.5,"payment_id":681377995},{"amount":36.48,"local_amount":3308.27,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3391.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.74,"payment_id":696587665},{"amount":37.49,"local_amount":3503.46,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3591.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.92,"payment_id":711505976},{"amount":39.06,"local_amount":3575.02,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3665.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.16,"payment_id":731022794},{"amount":39.27,"local_amount":3570.48,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3660.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.9,"payment_id":752110983}],"funded_date":"2015-02-09T22:40:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":819487,"name":"Lydia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lydia is a married woman with five children.

Meet Solomon, a 24-year-old young and energetic man who is so humble, honest, and a very hardworking man on this planet Earth. Solomon has siblings who he really adores so much and will always do anything good so that they never go to bed with hungry stomachs. <br \/><br \/>Solomon hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya. He never got the opportunity to advance his education and get a white-collar job, but this did not kill his dream of wanting to succeed in life. Solomon started farming and has been doing farming for the past six years. Throughout those years, he has gathered so much experience, and all the farming techniques are at his fingertips. Solomon practices mixed farming on his farm. Through the profits, he has managed to take care of his siblings\u2019 needs and give them a good education because he believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success\u201d. <br \/><br \/>Solomon is a man who is very enterprising. He is seeking a loan of KES 40,000 to start horticulture farming on his farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in his village, good soil, and a ready market for horticulture products, Solomon wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits. Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring men like Solomon to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. <br \/><br \/>Solomon hopes that through the loan, he will improve his living conditions. Solomon\u2019s dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year, he will not only be selling in the local market, but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. Through this, he will be able to assure his siblings a secure future and uninterrupted learning because he will be able to pay tuition fees on time. <br \/><br \/>Solomon is not a selfish man and will also want to impact positively on society. That is why he will employ people to work for him on his horticulture farm, hence having an impact on society."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":373.6,"image":{"id":1790236,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-10T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-09T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.23,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Solomon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.62,"local_amount":6633.22,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6800.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262747},{"amount":34.03,"local_amount":3024.86,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3101.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264947},{"amount":33.69,"local_amount":2995.02,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3070.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601117},{"amount":36.61,"local_amount":3254.07,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3336.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459581},{"amount":37.1,"local_amount":3342.83,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3427.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.51,"payment_id":681377994},{"amount":36.51,"local_amount":3311.63,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3395.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.75,"payment_id":696587664},{"amount":36.81,"local_amount":3439.4,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3526.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.88,"payment_id":711505975},{"amount":39.68,"local_amount":3631.8,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3723.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.18,"payment_id":731022793},{"amount":39.32,"local_amount":3575.82,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3665.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.91,"payment_id":752110982}],"funded_date":"2015-02-06T18:15:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":826206,"name":"Josiah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josiah, a father of three, lives in the remote village of Bonyunyu in Nyamira, an area known to have high demand for poultry products.

Waking up every morning to collect eggs makes him very proud. Feeding his poultry is his hobby. Josiah has always wanted to increase his poultry farming operation because the demand is overwhelming, but the biggest challenge has been lack of capital. \r\n\r\nJosiah has traits of a mobilizer, and he decided to mobilize other small-scale farmers who share this common problem. Together, they joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that uses a co-guarantee mechanism to provide agricultural-based loans. Josiah is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. With the loan, he will be able to buy more poultry and satisfy the overwhelming demand. Through the loan he will significantly increase his sales, and this will translate to more profits. \r\n\r\nDemand for chicken is high in Nyamira; it is a popular meal for many people, and fast food joints are always full. Increased profits will allow Josiah to improve his living conditions and to get out of the poverty-stricken situation he is currently in. Other than profits, he will also benefit from poultry manure, which has higher nitrogen than livestock manure. Through the loan, Josiah sees a brighter future.

married, and has three children.  Her daughters are 15 and 10, and her son is 12.  Guliston's husband, like many residents of the country, is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation.\r\n\r\nGuliston is a graduate of Tajik National State University.  After graduating, she decided to become a medical professional and help people.  She immediately enrolled in a vocational school for medicine, and has worked as a nurse for the past 20 years.  In addition, she spends her free time away from work on a sewing machine.\r\n\r\nThe reason Guliston is seeking a loan is to buy furniture.  For a long time, she's dreamed of buying new furniture for her home.  She hasn't made any new additions or renovations to the rooms in her home for many years and has always spent her money to provide for her family.  Guliston really deserves to improve her home's living conditions.  All these years, she's lived and sacrificed for the benefit of her family.  She hopes that you won't deny her this loan, and that she'll be able to improve her quality of life.          \r\n\r\n   \r\n  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1788405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"buy furniture to improve the living conditions of her home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Fayzabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"37.873056 69.775556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-01-10T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-09T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":71.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guliston","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":237.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":252.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":266.94},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":260.27},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":282.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":284.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":291.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":306.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":313.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":323.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":335.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":345.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.74},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.03},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.95,"local_amount":489.74,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:50:36Z","rounded_local_amount":502.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624882493},{"amount":50.05,"local_amount":266.94,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":273.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.34,"payment_id":636348851},{"amount":46.74,"local_amount":260.27,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":267.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.32,"payment_id":649621387},{"amount":50.96,"local_amount":282.72,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":290.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.58,"payment_id":665101348},{"amount":51.22,"local_amount":284.11,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":291.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.6,"payment_id":681399454},{"amount":52.39,"local_amount":291.49,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":299.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.91,"payment_id":696609532},{"amount":54.33,"local_amount":306.65,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":314.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7,"payment_id":711525558},{"amount":54.03,"local_amount":313.34,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:06:23Z","rounded_local_amount":321.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.64,"payment_id":731041332},{"amount":170.89,"local_amount":1004.74,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:05:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1030.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.05,"payment_id":752130307}],"funded_date":"2015-02-08T21:05:50Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T17:05:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":819512,"name":"Tufala","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tufala is a 29-year-old mother with 1 child and has a business of selling pancakes, pork cakes, and buns in her village to earn a living.\r\n\r\nTufala has requested a loan to buy a sack of flour, sack of sugar, bottle of vegetable oil, plastic bags, fry pan, and yeast to assist her in operating the business.

The above picture presents to you Luka, who lives in the Kapsowar area of Kenya, also known as the mango region because it produces the highest quality mangoes in the world. Luka is the father of one lovely child and has been doing farming for the past twelve years. Through dairy farming and poultry keeping, he has been able to produce milk and eggs. Luka is a very dedicated farmer who has a never-say-die attitude and enjoys every bit of farming because, through farming, he is able to take care of his family\u2019s needs and wants. Although he experiences challenges in farming, his attitude keeps him going. Enjoying what he does, he has even nicknamed his cow \u201clovii.\u201d\r\n\r\nLuka is seeking a 65,000 KES loan to buy a chaff cutter. A chaff cutter is a mechanical device that is used to cut hay into small pieces before mixing it with other forage. This assists the animal in digestion and prevents the animal from rejecting any part of the food. With the loan, he will be able to increase his milk productivity and also increase his income, hence reducing the poverty that is currently facing him. Luka's biggest dream is to get out of poverty, and this loan will be a stepping stone toward improving the living standards of his family and increasing his income level."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1790316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a chaff cutter to help feed his cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-10T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-09T23:30:03Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luka","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Salwen","image":812309}},{"id":826198,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph is a 30-year-old married man living in Kagadi-Uganda with 4 children.

","en":"Ahror is a young, married 34-year-old man. He lives with his parents in the town. His family has a small land plot, where they grow and dry fruits. His family also raises livestock. Ahror has a good experience in this business. Fattening up and selling livestock for meat is his sole source of income. Ahror is a hardworking man and, to provide a good future for this family and parents, works without rest. Now he wants to increase his livestock headcount and does not have enough money to accomplish this goal. Ahror decided to request a loan from the bank because he can buy livestock cheaper now. He wants to buy calves for fattening and subsequent resale.

She is 28 years old and lives with her husband, two daughters who are nine and three years old, and one son who is five years of age.\r\n\r\nAnita has an animal trading business that she has managed with the help of her husband for the last eight years. Her husband purchases goats by moving to weekly markets and sells them. In a week, he covers five nearby markets for this business. From this business, Anita gets a monthly income of 6,000 INR . Out of this income, she is hardly able to manage her household and business expenses. Although there is good market for this business, and Anita could have earned more income by purchasing more goats, finances were difficult for her. Therefore, she formed this SHG for expansion of her trading by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. By investing the present loan, Anita intends to purchase more numbers of goats to sell and earn more income. She hopes that this will help her in the future to construct a good house and provide a better education to her children. Of the other 12 members, three members are doing stone cutting work, two members are running a general store, one member is doing animal trading and four members are doing cultivation.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1790293,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more goats to sell and earn more income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"PENDRAPADAR, BALANGIR, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2015-01-10T23:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-09T23:50:05Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anla ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bilata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Keshari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nirash ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pahuntula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satyabhama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":156000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":156000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":826200,"name":"Ali's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 49-year-old proud father of 12 children.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ali\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 6.5 acres of land and purchase a total of 8 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1742453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-01-10T23:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-09T23:50:05Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ali","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roselyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jafred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cypria","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Godwin M","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roselyne E","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther K","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":102200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":826202,"name":"Christopher's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christopher is 25 years old and is often described as a very friendly person.

He is requesting a fifth loan through Tujijenge Tanzania, which he will use to buy cement, sand and water for making bricks. Kassim used the previous loans (all of which he paid back successfully) to increase stock in his business. His capital is now greater than before and he serves more people, though people still demand even more products. He dreams of adding more capital. Kassim gains a profit that he uses to cover school fees and home food expenses. He will share this loan with his loan group, Maarifa, which totals three members.

Arlan works hard to provide for the household and personal needs of his young family.\r\n\r\nArlan has operated a tricycle for four years already. His tricycle carries up to four passengers. In the Philippines especially in the provinces like Cavite, a tricycle is a common means of transportation. Jeepneys and buses are limited . Very few people own a vehicle. The townspeople usually ride a tricycle from their homes to market, church, to their friend\u2019s homes and to other destinations within their community. They even use that transport from one town to the other.  Arlan earns a minimum of Php 500 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help him continue his transport business, he is requesting a Php 10,000 loan which he will use to pay for gas and maintenance of his tricycle.  He is positive that this will boost his income, as tricycle transportation is really a necessity in their area. \r\n\r\nArlan plans to buy another tricycle unit and  dreams to be successful in his business so he can give his family a much better life. He aims to send his children to good schools. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week and were he can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

He grows a variety of crops and keeps dairy cows and poultry. The income he makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet his family's expenses. He needs to improve his income level, and that is why he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Victor passionately loves dairy farming and as he likes to put it \u201cdairy farming is close to my heart\u201d. He plans not to buy just an ordinary cow but to buy a quality breed of cow that will produce between 10-20 litres of milk a day. The additional milk will result in additional income and hence improved living conditions. The income generated from selling the milk will be used to fully repay the loan and to educate his children. He will also benefit from cow manure, which will be used to increase the fertility level of his farm, hence increasing productivity. Through the loan, he will also be able to build a biogas digester that will be helpful in saving energy.

She is 68 and has a higher education. She works as a director at the local school. She loves her work and treats every student as her own child. She has two children aged 25 and 23. Her husband, like the majority of men, is working in Russia.\r\n\r\nIn her free time, Oykhon works at home in animal husbandry. She likes to spend time in her cattle yard. Her grandfather taught her how to care for livestock. To this day, she follows his advice.

","en":"Farzona is a young beginning entrepreneur from the city of Sarband. She is 24. Her family situation didn't work out and she and her one child are currently living with her parents. She is an enterprising and purposeful woman who wants to start her own stable, growing business and is striving with all her heart toward this goal.\r\n\r\nFarzona plans to work selling children's and women's clothing. With her parents' support she has already acquired a retail spot at the market and bought some inventory for resale.

She is married and raised three children, aged 25, 23, and 20 years.  Nasiba's children live and work in the Russian Federation.  They had to leave their native land because they couldn't find work.  Nasiba and her husband live and work side by side.  They have a moderately sized piece of land where they grow crops.  \r\n\r\nNasiba and her husband have already finished seeding and now all that's left is to fertilize the land.  The fertilizer will help the crops grow well.  The problem is that they don't have the money to buy enough fertilizer.  So that they don't end up without a harvest in the spring, Nasiba has had to apply for a loan.  She believes you will support her and is relying on your

23 years old and very well-known in his community. He grew up with his parents, who educated him and instilled strong principles in him. They guided him down a good path, and furthermore, they taught him the trade of cooking because they own a diner.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing his middle school education through the local school, Rene's parents decided that the best thing for him would be to begin developing his own business. So, from a young age Rene, having shown his preference for the kitchen and having watched the people who worked for his parents, and upon finishing his degree with the support of his parents, took a few cooking courses. These courses were given through social programs in his community. \r\n\r\nRene has 8 years of experience in the diner business. Once he finished his introductory courses he launched and opened his first diner out of his home. After just one year in business, Rene met the woman who is now his wife, and she also loves cooking. Since it opened and through today, the diner has become the point of reference for eateries in the municipality. \r\n\r\nRene's passionate and entrepreneurial spirit enabled him to acquire furniture and equipment for the diner on credit from commercial retailers. The loans have since been paid off, but now it's necessary to purchase new stoves and sets of porcelain dishes in order to offer better service to his customers.\r\n\r\nHis dreams and aspirations have taken him very far in his community, and now Rene plans to open a new fast food business in the neighboring municipality, which will offer home delivery. Also among Rene's projects is to refinance in order to purchase two motorcycles which will be put to use making deliveries.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":508.1,"image":{"id":1765404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase two motorcycles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-12-27T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-10T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rene Alonso ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":40.52},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":42.61},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":45.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":44.55},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":47.18},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":51.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":53.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":57.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":61.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.52},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.27},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.18},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.9},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":85.58,"local_amount":85.58,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:07:50Z","rounded_local_amount":85.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833552},{"amount":49.29,"local_amount":49.29,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":49.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636201271},{"amount":48.52,"local_amount":48.52,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":48.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650537012},{"amount":48.68,"local_amount":48.68,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":48.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666802921},{"amount":52.89,"local_amount":52.89,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683482985},{"amount":53.77,"local_amount":53.77,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":53.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696540561},{"amount":53.42,"local_amount":53.42,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":53.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711454085},{"amount":56,"local_amount":56,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730974676},{"amount":59.95,"local_amount":59.95,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":59.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752063236}],"funded_date":"2015-02-09T23:07:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kati Mayfield","image":470169}},{"id":826603,"name":"Nueva Luz Del Ma\u00f1ana Nro Ii Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cNUEVA LUZ DEL MA\u00d1ANA NRO II\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Kamila. I am a 19-year-old student from Manas village in Chui region. I think that most of the village people have a great desire to get better education than they have. I am one of them. I finished a simple school and had a desire to study at one of the best Universities, that would help me to achieve my future goals.\r\n\r\nAfter graduation of my school I was lucky to win AUCA\u2019s full scholarship for one-year-study program at New Generation Academy. New Generation Academy gave me a chance to get good skills of English and helped to enter AUCA that now I am a freshman here. AUCA\u2019s tuition fee is too high for my family, but just smart and well-educated students can be part of it. I am happy to be one of them and receiving a Kiva loan will help me to grow further and achieve my bachelor degree.\r\n\r\nThere are five people in my family: my parents, my elder sister, me and little sister. My mother is a seamstress. Since 2012 she is the only breadwinner in our family as my father lost his job and doesn\u2019t work right now. But he re-sells goods at the market in fall and does construction with his friends when they offer him. Instability of income is the main problem of my family that we are always to save money for the hard times. My elder sister is a senior at another university and the younger one is a school-girl. Despite my family\u2019s financial situation I want to study at AUCA, because I know that it is a place, where I can get special knowledge for future career, and claim that this university is the best way to achieve my goal. AUCA have a lot of graduates from poor families, who were able not just to graduate from it, but also could change their and their families\u2019 future for the better side.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1764427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education
