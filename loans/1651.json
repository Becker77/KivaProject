is a 40-year-old single woman from Telavi city. She lives with her parents and brother, who is a daily-worker and generates 150 GEL monthly. \r\n\r\nDue to their bad financial conditions, Tea was unable to get a higher education or any profession. This is one of the reason of her unemployment. However, in order to make her bit for the family's welfare, she started a trading business. In particular, she buys spices at wholesale prices, then packs them and sells door-to-door at increased prices. The work is really hard for Tea, but the family doesn't have any significant income and live under poverty. She is eager to make additional income and deal with their financial difficulties. \r\n\r\nSo, Tea requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for starting a trading business startup but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time, because the creditors did not find the existing family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. Tea requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start up loan program provides start up credit with soft conditions for the country's poor people, who are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, and do not have access to credit products. With the received credit, Tea will purchase stock of clothing and will sell among her costumers, to whom she has already gained loyal attitude. \r\n\r\nShe awaits yours support and will be really grateful for the help.

Inga generates 400 GEL monthly; that is really hardly enough to cover all daily expenses and basic needs. \r\n\r\nFor increasing the productivity and generate more income, Inga plans to start her own activity. In the region, there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make a living. So, she decided to start a clothing trading business with a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Inga\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she was unable to satisfy their requirements. She received the credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo - Startup Program that gives poor people the chance to start or restart businesses. She will purchase stock of used clothing at wholesale prices and will open a shop at a good location. \r\n\r\nShe is a very enthusiastic and hardworking person with a great desire to ensure her daughter with good education for progressing in life.  This credit will be a great support for the family. Inga is thankful to Kiva Lenders for giving her a chance to make her own business.

Ever since he joined Ruma, he has been able to improve his business in delivering access of mobile financial services to his surrounding community. This time is his third loan from Kiva - the first two loans were fully funded and successfully repaid. As an entrepreneur, Sudarno is known as a professional and hardworking individual. Most of his customers have put their trust in Sudarno and become loyal customers. As the business keeps growing, he hopes to get a working capital loan in order to process more transactions in his shop. Meanwhile, he is also in the process of adding one more product that he wants to serve in his shop: e-commerce for low income communities, a new service from Ruma that enables people to buy products by laying-away their money in a safe account managed by certified Ruma agents like Sudarno. People pick stuff they want to buy from the product catalog, then make an order and payment at the Ruma agent's stall. The product will arrive right in front of the customer's door.

Santa Catarina Palopo on the shores of Lake Atitlan in Guatemala look forward to their monthly meetings. They have created a real web of support among themselves, generated income for their families and learned alot during the educational trainings. The women secured their very first loan, funded by KIVA investors last June and are pleased to report that the loan has been fully paid back on time. They are requesting an additional loan at this time.\r\n\r\nFor this new loan cycle, we are pleased to introduce 43-year-old Manuela who married quite young and has ten children. She was unable to attend school and grew up learning to embroider and weave like so many indigenous women. She has recently joined the Trust Bank and is about to take out her very first loan! She intends to use the funds to purchase beads, thread and other supplies for her jewelry and handicraft business. Manuela wants to have plenty of inventory as she sells in three different places around the Lake.\r\n\r\nManuela realizes the importance of education, for herself and her children. Each month during the meeting of her Trust Bank, she gains practical and useful information about the world around her and within her. For example, she has been learning about budgeting, accounting, marketing, pricing and customer service. She has gained confidence as she has learned about self-esteem, women\u2019s rights and women\u2019s health. Manuela has worked hard and at the beginning of the year, registered six of her ten children in school so that they would have more opportunities than she had. She has also had to buy school supplies and school uniforms.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for a woman like Manuela to walk into a bank and take out a loan. Non-governmental organizations like KIVA and Friendship Bridge are so important in the lives of these ladies. The months and years ahead are full of possibilities for them and their families. Thank you, KIVA investors, for your kindness and generosity!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5275,"image":{"id":1790432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"buy crafts supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Catarina Polopo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-01-11T07:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-10T07:30:01Z","loan_amount":5275,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebastiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramos ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Marta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora Liliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":5275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6672},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":6672},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":6672},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":6672},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":6672},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6640}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":879.87},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":879.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":879.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":879.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":879.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":879.87,"local_amount":6672,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:49:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6698.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610557953},{"amount":879.87,"local_amount":6672,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:25:56Z","rounded_local_amount":6698.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624231094},{"amount":879.87,"local_amount":6672,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6698.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636216824},{"amount":879.87,"local_amount":6672,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":6698.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649567025},{"amount":879.87,"local_amount":6672,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":6698.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665049181},{"amount":875.65,"local_amount":6640,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:46:50Z","rounded_local_amount":6665.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347040}],"funded_date":"2015-01-12T06:15:50Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:46:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":826310,"name":"Yusufu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yusuf is a hardworking married man with three children who are ages 10, 7 and 5 years, living in Kamwenge, Uganda.

She is a very active and energetic lady of 50 years living with her husband, one son and a daughter.\r\n\r\nNiramati\u2019s husband is a house painter and decorator who take contracts for painting buildings. He has a group of five painters who work for him with daily wages. Owing to his quality work and on-time service, people like to order Niramati\u2019s husband for painting. Presently, he earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR, which is not sufficient to invest in his work and maintain the family. Looking into the market demand for painting, he wants to have another group of painters to reach out to and meet the demands. For this, he needs some funds to purchase the required painting materials. Niramati\u2019s husband requested her to arrange some money. So, to help her husband, Niramati, through her SHG, took a loan of 16,000 INR for purchasing white wash, undercoat, paint stripper, primer, paint brushes, distemper (paint), creosote, etc. for the work. Niramati and her husband hope that through this investment, they will be able to increase the income of her family. Niramati has a dream of opening a cloth store in the future. She also wishes to give better schooling to her children. The other seven members of the SHG are also doing small enterprises like animal trading, vegetable cultivation, vegetable vending and a milk business.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1790409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase white wash, undercoat, paint stripper, primer, paint brushes, distemper(paint), and creosote ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"DARLO, BALANGIR, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2015-01-11T07:30:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-10T07:30:21Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basanti      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dutika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laxmi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mei  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nabin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niramati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rasmita  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saib ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":104000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":104000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":820220,"name":"Nicolas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nicolas es un hombre casado de 36 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en la comunidad Tzamabaj con sus 5 hijos de las siguientes edades, 15 a\u00f1os, 12 a\u00f1os, 9 a\u00f1os, 6 a\u00f1os y 4 meses, los primeros cuatro hijos estudian en la comunidad donde vive, \n\n Nicolas  adem\u00e1s de ser piloto automovilista se dedica tambi\u00e9n a la venta de maxan (envoltorio para conserva de alimentos)  este producto es muy vendible ya que la mayor\u00eda de las personas lo utilizan en las diferentes actividades tales como, bodas, cumplea\u00f1os y actividades de sus comunidades y mayor mente en la \u00e9poca navide\u00f1a, \u00e9l vende el maxan al menudeo y por mayor a otros vendedores, y con el poco capital con que cuenta ya no se da abasto en comprar mas maxan, Don Nicolas desde hace 13 a\u00f1os empez\u00f3 con esta actividad y es un vendedor muy conocido; \u00e9l vende en el mercado de Quetzaltenango y mucha gente lo llega a buscar.\n\n Con las ganancias del maxan, el sue\u00f1o de don Nicolas en el futuro es tener una tienda de abarrotes en su comunidad para generar mas ingresos y asi darle un mejor futuro a sus hijos. \n","en":"Nicolas is married, 36 years old, and lives in the community of Tzamababj with his 5 children who are the following ages; 15, 12, 9, 6, and 4 months.

Her business is in the community of \"Alto Pe\u00f1as,\" characterized by its closeness to the sacred Lake Titicaca, an agricultural area where they raise livestock -- cattle, sheep and camelid, and live on the fish and also the grains and vegetables of the place such as quinoa, freeze-dried potatoes, broad beans, potatoes, etc. It is characterized by a dry and cold climate, with a temperature that varies during the day between 1-12 degrees centigrade, and where the sun's rays hit the earth's surface with great force. \r\n\r\nMaria has tanned skin, is short, has long braided black hair, dresses traditionally (hat, shawl, and pollera [traditional Andean skirt]), her native language is Aymar\u00e1 and she speaks it there, and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for the business she does. She shares her life with her husband, who works in agriculture, and with her children, who go to school. They live in an adobe house with a thatched roof that has electricity and well water. Her business is making and selling traditional cheese. The process starts with the cow's milk that she gets part in the morning and part in the afternoon. She adds the curdling agent which she makes by extracting a part of the cow's udder. This begins to look like yogurt, and she mixes it with a wooden ladle, later it sits, curdling. She takes it out and puts it in another container to mature. \"I make cheese constantly, the work is done by the family; my children also help...\" she says. Her dream is to make cheese to sell in bulk. She wants to purchase dairy cows to increase her production. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 20 years she has been doing this work. \r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Maria asks for a loan to purchase dairy cows to increase her cheese production.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He was married, but since the relationship did not function, he decided to get a divorce. From this relationship, he has a four-year-old daughter. He supports her unconditionally. She is the only person who depends on him.\r\nDaniel works for a bakery. He sells French bread and sweetbread and keeps 30% of his total sales. He has had this job for 5 years. He decided to do this work because he saw that it was very important to support his daughter. Every day he travels around 5 kilometres on his sales route. He does this on his bike. When he goes to distant zones, he goes by motorcycle. He works from 5 am to 8 am in the mornings and in the afternoons from 2 to 6 pm.\r\nHe is requesting this loan for the purchase of a motorcycle. His current motorcycle has many mechanical problems. Far from helping, it complicates his work.

She said, \u201cI still miss him every day, and he still lives in my heart.\u201d \r\n\r\nDampui, the profiled borrower of the group, is pictured with her hand raised among the group members. She runs a medical store in her locality which remains as the only source of income for the household. She feels wonderful to serve the sick people through her medical store and is very satisfied with her business. \r\n\r\nShe manages to send her children to school from the income she gets from the medical store and also manages the household needs. Her never-ending support to her family and enthusiasm is a symbol for the neighbours to encourage one another. Being the only one working in the family, she has her ups and downs when it comes to financial matters. \r\n\r\nShe aspires to innovate her medical store by keeping different stock of medicines that will be easily available for many customers most of the time. The loan will be used to buy more stock of varieties of medicine for selling purposes. The income derived from the medical store will be used to provide for her family sufficiently.

She provides the educational fees for her children from her income, while her husband\u2019s income is used to meet their household's daily requirements. \r\n\r\nSales are high but according to the taste of customers, so sometimes she has a loss. Due to fluctuation of her income from the business, she is unable to save money and that limits her from selling more items. She hopes to sell more items so that she could attract more customers and earn more income. She wishes to save some amount for their future so that her family could have better living conditions. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will buy more varieties of vegetables to sell in the market. She strives for better living conditions for her family. \r\n\r\nAll the group members are very happy to get a loan from Kiva. The loan will be used to promote their businesses.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

They live in Churachandpur town. <br \/><br \/>Her husband is an ice cream vendor and earns his income from the fraction of money he gets by selling ice cream by the roadside. The amount of income her husband earns was not enough to meet the daily needs of the whole family; this became the turning point for Mary to start her own business. There was nothing much she could do to provide enough for the family. So, she started running a small tea stall in their locality, which was the only option for her to start earning. <br \/><br \/>After she started running the tea stall, her financial condition was slightly better than the days before. With her meager income, she could not extend her business the way she hoped for. She wishes to expand her business by attracting more customers, and for that she needs to buy more stock of sugar, milk powder, wheat flour, edible oil, and other ingredients. She has been waiting for a long time to expand her tea stall, but due to the shortage in finances, she had to bear with it until she came across WSDS, which became the sole hope of Mary to achieve her long-awaited dream of expanding her tea stall. <br \/><br \/>Hopefully, she will now be able to expand her tea stall with the help of a Kiva loan. She also hopes to have sufficient household finances in the near future. She is very happy with the help she received from the lenders; this will change her life for the better. She is indebted towards the help she received, without whose support her life would have been the same with many hardships. <br \/><br \/>The rest of the group members are engaged in similar activities to achieve their own financial freedom.

He lived with his parents until he was fifteen.\r\n\r\nByron is married to Melania and they have four children, the three older now attending the local school. He has been working all his life, and with a lot effort he was able to buy a little land where he plants coffee, he works the field with his children, and here he also built his home. It is a small, humble house, he comments, where he lives with his family.\r\n\r\nIn the Sardinal community there is no electricity, so he has to use flashlights and a small panel that he got ahold of, but it is failing together with the battery. This is why he is asking for a loan to buy a solar panel with its battery and controller. This way they will have light in the evenings, his children will be able to do their homework from school, and his wife will be able to prepare breakfast at dawn since Byron has to leave the house pretty early in the morning to get to the farm where he works.\r\n\r\nByron is very grateful for the opportunity to get this loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":190.1,"image":{"id":1790449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy a solar energy system","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":279,"posted_date":"2015-01-11T18:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-10T18:10:08Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Byron Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":290.22,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.86},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.31},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.05},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.42,"local_amount":87.47,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T11:21:18Z","rounded_local_amount":90.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624403890},{"amount":99.68,"local_amount":96.43,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-25T12:10:53Z","rounded_local_amount":99.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711675308}],"funded_date":"2015-01-12T22:42:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":820525,"name":"Juan Edgar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edgar es un se\u00f1or bastante din\u00e1mico, se dedica desde hace 15 a\u00f1os a hornear man\u00ed  procesarlo y empacarlo en diferentes modalidades para su comercializaci\u00f3n, como medio de ingresos, es casado, con un hijo a su cargo al que apoya en su desarrollo acad\u00e9mico, este se\u00f1or se presento a Ceprodel para solicitar financiamiento el que utilizar\u00eda en la Compra de Mani en Cascara, para posterior procesarlo y de esa manera mejorar las condiciones de vida de su familia.","en":"Edgar is quite a dynamic man.
