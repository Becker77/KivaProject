debido a la falta de transporte, en el camino se puede admirar un paisaje impresionante, los \u00e1rboles son enormes y muy frondosos ya que es una parte muy elevada de la comunidad, es un lugar muy tranquilo y y el aire ofrece un fresco aroma a campo.\n\nDon Gerardo quien es el representante del grupo tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casado con la se\u00f1ora Aurelia desde hace 14 a\u00f1os y juntos formaron una familia con cuatro hijos. Don Gerardo y Do\u00f1a Aurelia han sido unos padres muy trabajadores que buscan superarse por el bienestar de sus hijos.\n\nHace siete a\u00f1os ambos salieron a la ciudad de M\u00e9xico para trabajar y obtener ingresos para su familia. Don Gerardo trabajaba como alba\u00f1il y Do\u00f1a Aurelia como empleada dom\u00e9stica. Sin embargo, el dejar a sus hijos a cargo de otros familiares durante tanto tiempo les hizo decidir regresar a su comunidad. Don Gerardo muy sonriente coment\u00f3 \u201cA m\u00ed nunca me ha gustado trabajar como alba\u00f1il, lo que m\u00e1s me apasiona es estar detr\u00e1s del volante\u201d. Por esta raz\u00f3n, lo primero que hizo al regresar fue buscar empleo como chofer de taxis, actividad que desempe\u00f1\u00f3 durante seis a\u00f1os, tiempo en el que adem\u00e1s estuvo ahorrando para comprar un veh\u00edculo y trabajar por su propia cuenta. Cuando finalmente tuvo su auto, fue dif\u00edcil conseguir los permisos adecuados para ofrecer su servicio. Todos los d\u00edas Don Gerardo se esmeraba para obtener los suficientes ganancias, solventar los gastos del hogar y continuar rentando las placas de servicio de taxi.\n\nSu esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n se han vistos reflejados en la estabilidad econ\u00f3mica de su familia y de su negocio, ahora tiene su veh\u00edculo, sus placas y todos sus documentos en regla para poder transitar como taxista sin ning\u00fan problema. Ahora con su pr\u00e9stamo Don Gerardo podr\u00e1 invertir en llantas nuevas y suspensiones para su autom\u00f3vil.\n\nMientras tanto, Do\u00f1a Aurelia tambi\u00e9n lo apoya trabajando en la venta de productos de belleza y al igual que su pareja, ella se ha esforzado mucho porque inici\u00f3 s\u00f3lo ganando comisiones de venta, ahora como promotora tiene un sueldo base. Ambos est\u00e1n muy contentos y agradecidos con VisionFund y KIVA  porque los ha ayudado en sus negocios. Su meta es seguir mejorando su vivienda y ofrecelres mejores oportunidades a sus hijos. \n\nAraceli quien tambi\u00e9n pertenece al grupo necesita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar m\u00e1s cerditos peque\u00f1os y Do\u00f1a Aurelia en sus cosm\u00e9ticos.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el municipio donde viven Gerardo y Aurelia, detr\u00e1s de ellos se puede ver el taxi*","en":"To arrive at the \u201cVictoria\u201d group one has to travel various kilometers on foot due to the lack of transportation. Along the way there is impressive landscape, enormous leafy trees as the community\u2019s elevation is very high. It is a very tranquil place and the air offers the fresh aroma of the countryside.<br \/><br \/>Gerardo is the representative of the group. He is 34 years old, married to Aurelia for 14 years and together they have formed a family with 4 children. Gerardo and Aurelia have been very hard-working parents who strive to provide for the well-being of their children.<br \/><br \/>7 years ago they both left to Mexico City to work and obtain income for their family. Gerardo worked as a bricklayer and Aurelia as a domestic employee. Nevertheless, leaving their children with other family members for such a long time made them decide to return to their community. Gerardo smiles and says, \u201cI never liked working as a bricklayer. What I like the most is to be driving.\u201d For that reason, the first thing he did upon returning to the village was seek employment as a taxi driver. He did this work for 6 years, during which time he saved money to buy a vehicle and work for himself. When he finally acquired his car, it was difficult to get the adequate permissions to offer his services. Every day Gerardo worked to get enough income, meet his household expenses, and continue renting taxi services.<br \/><br \/>His effort and dedication have been reflected in the economic stability of his family and his business. Now he has his vehicle, his credentials, and all the documents in order to be able to work as a taxi driver without any problem. Now Gerardo seeks a loan to invest in new tires and suspension for his car.<br \/><br \/>Meanwhile Aurelia also works selling beautify products and like her husband, she has strived a lot because she began only earning sales commissions. Now as a promoter she has a base salary. Both are very content and thankful to VisionFund and Kiva because they have helped their businesses. Their goal is to continue improving their home and offering the best they can.<br \/>Araceli also belongs to the group and needs a loan to buy more piglets and Aurelia her cosmetics.<br \/><br \/>*The

She has a secondary education and has been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture for many years already, two activities which provide her family with its main source of income.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently owns two cows.  She also grows corn on 0.52 hectare of land and has an apple orchard.  In addition to farming, she works as a saleswoman in a store.  She makes a monthly income of about 10,000 som (KGS), which is vastly insufficient for a decent living.  For this reason, she has decided to expand her business and has turned to Bai Tushum for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy three cows.  Martaba plans to reinvest the earnings from her loan to further increase her number of farm animals.  She also wants to save some money towards her son's wedding.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1912.5,"image":{"id":1789336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase three cows in order to boost her income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Zhiyde village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-01-11T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-10T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":35.18,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martaba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":637.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:45:26Z","rounded_local_amount":37546.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636161598},{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":37546.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291159},{"amount":602.32,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:58:29Z","rounded_local_amount":37546.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":35.18,"payment_id":730933581}],"funded_date":"2015-01-27T00:33:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":820243,"name":"Sherlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fifty-three-year-old Sherlita  engages in a food vending business.

She has the equivalent of a high school education.  She works in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities which constitute her family's main source of income.  She started in this field 14 years ago when she purchased her first livestock for 10,000 som (KGS).  Kanaiym and her family have worked very hard over the years and they currently own two cows and 20 sheep.  Kanaiym also grows hay and beans on 1.5 hectare of leased land and 1.5 hectare of her own land.  She sells milk on a daily basis and makes a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to Bai Tushum for a loan of 65,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy 10 sheep in order to increase her livestock headcount.  She is planning to reinvest the earnings from her loan into further increasing her number of farm animals.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1789341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 10 sheep to increase her herd.

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m applying for Kiva loan because my family is not currently able to pay for my study at AUCA. We live in a small town, where most of the people have very low income. My father works as a driver in a van in a route Karakol-Bishkek-Karakol. Usually his work depends on the season and he works mostly during the summer, when people travel to the Issyk-Kul Lake. But when the season is over, he has the chance to drive once a week. \r\n\r\nMy mother has a small business on the leased space in our town. The main problem is that the level of purchasing power of our citizens is extremely low, and trade is the main thing that Karakol people do. Our people don\u2019t produce anything, and due to it there is an aggravation of competition and market overstocking of products. During the summer, when some tourists come to the town, she is able to sell more than she does in winter or in spring. \r\n\r\nI have two grandmothers who financially depend on my parents too. They are 78 and 80 years old. They have a small pension, which isn\u2019t enough even for their food. We have to take care of them and they often need medicaments and doctor visits, which also lies on my parents.\r\n\r\nMy main goal is to get the high quality education in English, which AUCA provides. In fact, many AUCA Alumni are prosperous and have implemented their ideas into reality. But without a Kiva loan my family can\u2019t afford my tuition fees, and my situation lets me count just on Kiva lenders.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1765639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Cambodia. He has three children who live under his support. To support the family, he is working very hard on his own farmland by growing rice and selling the crop to the local dealers and customers in the market. \r\n\r\nThe net profit that he can generate is USD 2.00 a day, on average.

He spent his childhood years in a village where he showed a love for nature and farm work.  Bobomurot wasn't able to go to college after finishing secondary school as his mother was sick at the time and needed an operation.  Instead of preparing for exams, Bobomurot worked in construction and helped his parents.  At the age of 25, he got married and continued to live with his parents.  Currently, he raises cattle on a plot of land of his own, and is helped in everything by his wife and oldest son.  Every morning, his wife milks their cows and takes the milk to a marketplace to sell.  \r\n\r\nBobomurot is a hardworking and patient man who toils away to provide his children with all the necessities of life.  He's turned to MDO Arvand for financial assistance so he can increase the headcount of his herd and stock up on cattle feed, and would like to thank them in advance for their trust and support. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1759642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Mastchoh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-12-28T00:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-11T00:00:04Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bobomurot","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":586.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":597.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":615.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":586.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":597.65},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":615.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1800,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755519975}],"funded_date":"2015-02-10T21:35:26Z","paid_date":"2015-11-25T13:13:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":820339,"name":"Bi\u00ean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bi\u00ean is 25 years old and he is married with one child.

The group \u201c Rel\u00e1mpago\u201d is on its second cycle with VisionFund, and they chose the name because of the speed with which loans are granted. The members are:\r\nElba: sale of desserts, napkins, and tamales. \r\nRolando: grocery sales \r\nDelfina: haberdashery sales \r\nRogelia: sale of chicken, cosmetics, and fried food\r\nMaricruz: food sales\r\nJudith: perfume sales\r\nLucia: soda sales\r\nOlga: Gelatin sales\r\nAgueda: perfume sales\r\nEmilia: sodas and perfume sales \r\nVirginia: soda sales \r\nElba is a charismatic, entrepreneurial, cheerful, and hard-working. Seventeen years ago she formed a family with Pedro, who works in the field, cutting cane. They are the parents of one teenager and two children, one of them is sponsored by WorldVision. The three continue to study and Elba works so that this situation won\u2019t change. \r\nSix years ago, Elba went to several baking courses, where she learned to make cakes, jelly, flan, carlotas (a dessert made with cookies, sugar, and fresh fruit), and other desserts. In this way, 4 years ago she found the motivation to open a business to sell made-to-order cakes, as well as jelly and flan every day in her home. On top of that, Elba sews and knits napkins to sell in the same community, and on weekends she bakes and sells ranchero-style tamales. What is most important for her is to generate income for the benefit of her family. With her income she can help her husband with the household expenses, and reinvest in all the necessary material to continue with her activities. \r\nElba dreams with setting up a small bakery, but she hasn\u2019t been able to do this. Recently, her husband got ill and he had to stop working as a cab driver, and they also suffered the loss of a family member. But this has not been an obstacle for her to keep getting ahead. \u201cI know things will change, what worries me most is my family, and while we are together, we can face anything.\u201d\r\nWith the loan that she is requesting, Elba wants to buy flour, eggs, flavoring, gelatin, peaches, and gas, because her clients have asked for three cakes. \u201cThank you for bringing us this opportunity, with it we can reach, little by little, one of our dreams.\u201d\r\n\r\n*Some of the members of the group in the photograph show the makeup that they sell. Elba is wearing a navy blue shirt. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4300,"image":{"id":1760075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy flour, eggs, flavoring, gelatin, peaches, and gas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"ARROYO DE ENMEDIO, ACATLAN DE PEREZ FIGUEROA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-28T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-11T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":4300,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rolando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Delfina Irma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rogelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricruz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agueda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":63000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":7875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":537.5,"local_amount":7875,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":7914.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595349969},{"amount":1075,"local_amount":15750,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":15829.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980697},{"amount":1075,"local_amount":15750,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":15829.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423849},{"amount":1075,"local_amount":15750,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":15829.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769180},{"amount":537.5,"local_amount":7875,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":7914.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649763940}],"funded_date":"2014-12-29T16:14:08Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Orozco","image":551274}},{"id":814728,"name":"Mulangane Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente KAMWENDA, m\u00e8re de 9 enfants tous \u00e9coliers et mari\u00e9 \u00e0 un sans emploi, est pr\u00e9sidente du groupe MULANGANE.

She shares her life with her husband, who works in agriculture, her older children go to school, and the young one is a baby. They live in a house made of brick with an iron roof which has electricity services and water from a well. Her work is the making and sale of artisanal cheese. The most produced and consumed cheese varieties are fresh cheese, small cheese (sweet rennet curd), double cream cheese, and chaque\u00f1o cheese (semi-hard and ripened). \u201cOur most common problem is the scarcity of milk during the winter season, it causes the price of cheese to rise because the milk is scarce\u2026\u201d she says. Her dream is to produce larger quantities, she wants to make a purchase of dairy cattle to produce a larger quantity of milk for her business. In the 18 years that she has had this occupation, this is her first loan sequence. \r\nIt is for these reasons that Silveira asks for a loan, to purchase dairy cattle to increase cheese production. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1767110,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese Making","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase dairy cattle to increase her production of cheese.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-28T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-11T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silveria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":324.79},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":313.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":309.3},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":337.52},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":329.69},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":345.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":335.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":380.68},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":373.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":381.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":404.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":410.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":423.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":438.71},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":446.32},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":468.65},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":497.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.29},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.14},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.7},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.05},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.94},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.36},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.62},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.29},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.71,"local_amount":346.32,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":350.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157458},{"amount":43.68,"local_amount":298.3,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":301.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554447},{"amount":45.35,"local_amount":309.7,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":313.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624227001},{"amount":48.36,"local_amount":330.3,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":334.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214177},{"amount":48.28,"local_amount":329.69,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":333.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564300},{"amount":50.6,"local_amount":345.56,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:10:37Z","rounded_local_amount":349.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046273},{"amount":738.02,"local_amount":5040.13,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:38:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5099.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344109}],"funded_date":"2014-12-30T04:36:14Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:38:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Orozco","image":551274}},{"id":820222,"name":"Lyda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lyda works hard to support her family.

But due to a lack of capital, she has to bear the consequences of providing for her family and the store. Hopefully, she will now be able to revive her store and save herself and the family through the Kiva loan. The loan will be used to buy stock of medicines, stationery items and groceries for selling purposes. She is very grateful to Kiva for giving her the opportunity to be back again on her own feet.

Ella conserva a los animales durante 8 meses para asegurarse de que alcancen el tama\u00f1o y peso adecuados para tener m\u00e1s ganancias. Los animalitos los compra en la misma comunidad y cuando ya son lo suficientemente grandes, los ofrece a las personas que se dedican a preparar \"barbacoa\", un platillo tradicional preparado con carne de borrego. Todos los d\u00edas, Yolanda se levanta muy temprano, lleva a sus hijos a la escuela y despu\u00e9s les dedica aproximadamente cinco horas a los animales entre sacarlos a pasear y alimentarlos. \u201cPara m\u00ed no es nada complicado cuidar de mis borregos porque as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n puedo estar al pendiente de mis hijos sin tener que salir de casa para obtener un ingreso extra\u201d. \n\nYolanda est\u00e1 muy contenta y agradecida con su pr\u00e9stamo porque podr\u00e1 comprar mas borreguitos, ella no invierte demasiado en alimento porque aprovecha el pasto y el zacate que hay en los campos de su comunidad. Sin embargo, una de sus dificultades es la falta de agua en su comunidad, no hay agua potable as\u00ed que ella y sus ni\u00f1os deben recorrer varios kil\u00f3metros para llevar agua a su casa para darle de beber a sus borregos y tambi\u00e9n para uso propio.

Por el momento, los habitantes de la comunidad tambi\u00e9n deben caminar largas distancias para comprar alimentos.

She keeps the animals for 8 months to make sure they reach an adequate size and weight to make more profit. She buys the small animals in the community, and when they are big enough, she offers them to people who prepare \u201cbarbacoa,\u201d a traditional dish made with lamb meat. Every day, Yolanda gets up very early, takes her children to school, and later dedicates 5 hours to the animals, taking them out and feeding them. \u201cFor me it is not difficult to take care of my lambs, because in this way I can keep an eye on my children without having to leave home to obtain extra income.\u201d\r\nYolanda is very happy and grateful for her loan, because she will be able to buy more lambs. She does not invest in food too much, because she takes advantage of the grass and the fodder in the fields of her community. However, one of the difficulties is the lack of water in her community. There is no potable water, so she and her children have to walk several kilometers to bring water to their home and give it to the lambs, and also for their own use. In spite of this, Yolanda is a hard-working woman, and she is not worried about walking or bringing the water from one place to another. \r\nYolanda dreams of saving money and opening a small grocery shop, which would be very beneficial for her and her neighbors. At the moment, the residents of the community also have to walk long distances to purchase food. She would also like to continue raising animals, because she wants to help her children with their studies, so they can finish a professional degree.\r\nThe other members of the group are also very happy and grateful for their loan, because they can invest in economic activities. Maria Isabel, Maria Petra, and Felicitas also have the same occupation as Yolanda, and they need to buy animals and feed. Also, they all make embroidered napkins which they sell to obtain extra income for their families. \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken at Yolanda\u2019s house, they show a tablecloth that they also make, and are about to sell. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1763797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more lambs.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tres Estrellas, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-28T02:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-11T02:30:01Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Petra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":2750,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2761.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595349970},{"amount":375,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5522.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980698},{"amount":375,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5522.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423850},{"amount":375,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5522.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769181},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":2750,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2761.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649763941}],"funded_date":"2014-12-28T07:28:51Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Orozco","image":551274}},{"id":820361,"name":"Jean Claude","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jean Claude is a 33-year-old married father of three children between two and ten years of age, two of whom go to school.

En \u00e9poca decembrina este es un muy buen negocio, en casa de su pap\u00e1 ella y sus otros hermanos elaboran los adornos, mientras su pap\u00e1 y otros miembros de la familia viajan a otro Estado de la rep\u00fablica mexicana para venderlos en los dos puestos que ya tienen bien establecidos. Mary y sus hermanos deben trabajar a marchas forzadas porque estos adornos se venden muy r\u00e1pido y seguramente en algunos d\u00edas su pap\u00e1 regresara por m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda. Mary necesita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar materia prima como cart\u00f3n, unicel, pegamento, escarcha, diamantina, hilo c\u00e1\u00f1amo, etc. Ella viajar\u00e1 a la cuidad de M\u00e9xico para poder adquirir su material porque ah\u00ed lo puede conseguir a un mejor precio.

A very great friendship exists among them, perhaps because they have known each other for many years. Their charm and cheerfulness set them apart. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n, or Mary, as they affectionately call her, is 21 years old.  She has been common-law-married to Isaac for two years.  He doesn\u2019t have a permanent job, but works seasonally.  They don\u2019t have children yet, but they plan to have a family someday.\r\n\r\nSince she was very young, Mary saw how her grandfather and father used to make Christmas decorations such as bells, Christmas Eve decorations, angels, pi\u00f1atas, etc.  She always contributed to the family business, but just about two years ago she began to invest in it in order to have a small income.  \r\n\r\nThis is a very good business in the holiday season. She and her siblings make the decorations in her father\u2019s house, while he and other family members travel to another state in Mexico to sell them from two stalls that they already have well established.  Mary and her siblings have to work around the clock because these decorations sell very quickly, and her father will be returning within a few days for more merchandise.\r\n\r\nMary needs a loan to purchase materials such as cardboard, Styrofoam, glue, glitter frost, glitter, hemp thread, etc. She will travel to Mexico City to acquire her materials because she can get a better price there.  In the meantime, she hopes that her father will have very good sales in order to have better earnings.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making Christmas decorations, Mary has another occupation. She says, \u201cFive months ago, with my first loan, I was able to begin selling costume jewelry\u201d.  She works a few days a week in the town plaza, selling her items.  Although Mary has a lot of competition, her earnings are good; and she enjoys the time when she is selling because she loves the contact with people. Mary dreams of having a shop of her own someday so that she can be more secure by not having to walk along the streets, and also be able to have more merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Felipa, who sells clothing; Alicia, who sells tea; Delgadina, who sells tortillas; Mar\u00eda C. and Mar\u00eda G., who sell costume jewelry; Ofelia, who sells household items; and Isabel, who sells vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken at Do\u00f1a Felipa\u2019s house.  The ladies appear with some of the hand embroidered cloths that they make in order to earn extra income for their families. The embroideries are used to cover the tortillas and other foods.  Mary is standing, holding the blue napkin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1763927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase materials such as cardboard, Styrofoam, glue, glitter frost, glitter, hemp thread, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"san antonio Enchisi, Atlacomulco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-28T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-11T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ofelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delgadina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":37000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.62},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.62},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.62},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":9250,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":9295.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595349968},{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":9250,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:52Z","rounded_local_amount":9295.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980695},{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":9250,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":9295.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423847},{"amount":315.63,"local_amount":4625,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4647.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769178},{"amount":315.62,"local_amount":4625,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4647.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597689}],"funded_date":"2014-12-28T20:05:57Z","paid_date":"2015-06-18T13:26:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanora Brennan","image":null}},{"id":820963,"name":"Juan Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan de 38 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su madre, el se dedica desde hace 10 a\u00f1os a la agricultura a la siembra de Chile dulce, pepino, berenjenas y frijol, comercializa sus productos en los diferentes mercados y ya tiene clientes establecidos, el esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de fertilizantes, abonos, semillas, herbicidas y mejorar el terreno que muestra en la fotograf\u00eda y asi poder tener mejores ingresos.","en":"Juan is 38 years old.

Here is her story:<br \/><br \/>\u201cMy name is Saikal and I am 19. Nine years ago my parents divorced. I live with my mother and my sister. My father has another family and doesn\u2019t keep in touch with us. My mother is such a person, who keeps the world turning. Not only was she able to raise us alone, but she also gave us an opportunity to go to the kindergarten and school.  My mother is a teacher in our village and says that education promotes individual freedom and empowerment and yields important development benefits. Yet millions of children and adults remain deprived of educational opportunities, many as a result of poverty. That\u2019s why she wanted to give us a good education and still does her best.<br \/><br \/>I studied at a simple school in the village, but had a great desire to enter one of the best universities in order to build a bright future. One year ago I was a finalist of AUCA\u2019s full Scholarship for the one-year-study program at New Generation Academy. There were 70 students from different parts of Kyrgyzstan who, like me, came from a poor family but were lucky to win this award.  It allows us to study, live, and eat for free. As a result, I understood the value of the education, which allows you to work where you want, travel where you want, and makes you confident of your bright future.<br \/><br \/>New Generation Academy made great changes in me and in my view for life. My big dream at the present is to get a degree, gain good knowledge in my sphere, and find my place in this huge world. AUCA is the place where I can get all of them, a place where I feel myself at home, a place, where I am respected by my lovely friends and brilliant teachers. I kindly ask Kiva lenders to help me with my tuition fee so that I may continue studying just as before.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1765739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Hajara Habila, like other members of Babban Gona, intends to use the extra income to provide food and clothing for her family, and hopes to ensure her children are educated and have professional jobs.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1636361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy food and clothing, thereby eliminating pressure to sell corn for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-12-28T05:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-11T05:30:05Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hajara Habila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":13532,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":13532}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-28T12:20:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":826774,"name":"Ishrat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ishrat is responsible mother of six children.

Due to insufficient financial means he is unable to buy a used van for his transportation services. Therefore Ishrat has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan Ishrat's husband can afford the cost of purchasing a used van easily. In this way he can provide better transport services to earn a profitable income.

She is 29 years old and a mother of one boy. She lives with her husband and in-laws in Churachandpur. As a hardworking mother, wife and daughter-in-law, she started running a business selling used clothes along the roadside in the hopes of building a better financial future for the family. Her husband is engaged in computer work and has been the main source of income for the family. Hmangaikim buys used clothes and resells them to customers for income generation, which supplements her husband\u2019s income. Selling and buying used clothes is very popular in the area because it is cheap and people can easily afford to buy them. Winter clothes are costly and customers flock to buy used clothes, especially during this season. The income that she gets from selling used clothes is spent on providing the basic needs of her son and other household needs. Her in-laws are also supported by them.

One of the members of this group is Dipika who has her hand raised in the photo. She is 24 years old and her family consists of her husband and a child.\r\n \r\nDipika has been running a mixture making and supply business in her house with the help of her husband for the last seven years. Mixture is possibly one of the most popular evening snack recipes in India. There are many variations to the classic mixture recipe with different ingredients that can be added. In a week, Dipika supplies around 100 kgs of mixture to the retailers. Her husband supplies mixture to the retailers of 10 nearby villages within a 10 km radius. Dipika earns a monthly income of 8,000 INR, which is not sufficient to materialize her dream. Dipika says looking into better quality and packing, there is a lot of demand from the locality but owing to less production due to the lack of stock of ingredients, she is not able to meet their demands. So by availing a loan of 12,000 INR through her SHG, she wants to buy more stock of ingredients to increase her production level to meet the demand and grab her customers.  Dipika will use the present loan to purchase raw materials like oil, besan (dough), peanuts, roasted gram, curry leaves, hing, soda, sugar, cashew nuts, etc. in bulk, which will reduce her purchasing and transportation costs. She can also produce mixture for a longer period.  Dipika is hopeful that this investment will definitely help her to get more income to materialize her dreams of the best education for her child, constructing a good house, purchasing some gold and helping her family to lead a better lifestyle. The other nine active members of the group are also doing small businesses like vegetable vending, Tiffin stall, poultry farm etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1790724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase oil, besan (dough), peanuts, roasted gram, curry leaves, hing, soda, sugar, and cashew nuts for mixture production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"SARDHAPUR, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2015-01-12T06:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-11T06:00:03Z","loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dipika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hiradri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laksmi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mithula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabetri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soshi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tilotama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-10T00:10:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":820421,"name":"Azra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Azra  is 45 years old and a married woman.

As this village is situated on the riverbank, vegetable cultivation and vending is the primary source of livelihood of most of the members of this group. Kasturi is also one of them. The lady sitting in front with her hand raised is Kasturi. She is a very energetic lady of 31 years.\r\n\r\nKasturi has a vegetable cultivation farm of one hectare. She and her husband manage the farm. Her husband is an active and cheerful farmer. They produce vegetables like brinjal, cauliflower, carrot, cabbage, chili, cucumber, papaya, ladies finger, onions, etc. on the farm. She sells her products to the traders of the nearest town who come to take vegetables from her farm. Kasturi says that she earns a minimum of 5,000 INR per month from this business, which is insufficient to meet the day to day expenses of her family as well as the farm expenses. Kasturi wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Kiva through Mahashakti Foundation. She will use the present loan to buy a water pump to lift water from the river, fertilizer, seeds and pesticides for her farm. She expects a good return from her business by expanding her cultivation. Kasturi dreams of constructing a house and purchasing a bike for her husband, which will help him to do the business very efficiently. She also hopes to give her whole family a bright future through her hard work.\r\n \r\nThe other 11 members of this group are also involved in businesses like vegetable cultivation, general grocery

Even so, the family doesn't have enough income to meet normal living conditions and cover even basic needs. \r\nAs a result, Inga requested a loan from local financial institutions several times to help her expand her agribusiness, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time, because the creditors did not find the existing family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program gives provisions for business startups and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who, regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, do not have access to credit products. With the receives credit, Inga will purchase bulls and make them work for barging the firewood. The family will provide their and nearby villages with firewood and will be able to generate more income, especially during the season.

Dushanbe. She has three children - two sons and a daughter. Her children attend a secondary school. Hafiza is involved in raising her children. Her husband works in the Russian Federation. Hafiza learned how to cut and sew women's clothing 6 years ago. It was not easy for her to learn this trade, but she learned it quickly in order to start earning money sooner and improve her family's financial situation. Hafiza used to wait for her husband to send them money and now Hafiza earns money by herself, some, but enough to cover her children's unplanned expenses.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to buy a cow.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Philip\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 5.5 acres of land and purchase a total of 5 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1738326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase two solar lights and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"kakamega south","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-01-12T07:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-11T07:00:03Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lijuma Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Trufena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":75100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-08T02:16:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katrina Drabeck","image":null}},{"id":820431,"name":"Shamshad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shamshad is 52 years old, married, and she has 2 children.

The eldest has just finished his obligatory military service.\r\n\r\nThey live in their own home, which is built from adobe and has drinking water, electricity and drains.  \r\n\r\nShe sells 'Api' which is a typical drink of the area.  This drink is made from purple or yellow corn, which comes from the valleys.  It is crushed and then you add sugar, cinnamon and cloves.  It is normally served hot so that it maintains its flavor, although some people also drink it cold.  It can be enjoyed with 'bu\u00f1uelos or fried pastry. It is delicious served on a cold day with one of these pastries to go with it.\r\n\r\nSusana says: \"the cold climate can be overcome by drinking my delicious 'Api'.  I have a lot of customers who come to me every day and have breakfast here in the early hours of the morning\".  \r\n\r\nShe dreams of improving her business.  To do this she would like to remodel a room so that she can use it as a selling point.  This would be the second loan from this institution in her seven years in the business.  She hopes that she will be able to have a nice room where she can sell her 'Api' and snacks."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":395.64,"image":{"id":1762397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

children and lives in the village of Kagumo in the Kerugoya area of Kenya. As a girl, she watched women in her village mobilize to replace traditional thatched roofs with waterproof corrugated iron. The memory of this collective effort led her to join Gakui self-help group. For the past year, Jane has been actively involved in mixed farming. Because she is from rural Kenya, gender roles still apply and women do the heavy work of fetching and carrying water and wood, in addition to household chores, childcare and tending crops. Many are left to run farms alone while their husbands migrate in search of paid employment. This has not been a setback because Jane has been making great profits in farming. Kerugoya is one of the places with conditions that favor horticulture farming: good climate, soils, transport system, and market. Jane has always wanted to diversify and start horticultural farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is lack of funds. She is therefore requesting a loan to start horticultural farming. Through the Gakui self-help group, whose members co-guarantee each other to secure a loan, Jane joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance organization that supports young and enterprising farmers. With your loan Jane intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers and potatoes. Proximity to an airstrip will allow her to transport the produce faster to an international market, hence enabling her to make more money. This loan will improve Jane's living conditions and secure the future of her children.\r\nJane\u2019s hopes and dreams for the future are to improve and climb the success ladder a step at a time as her family

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She has been married and is the mother of two small girls. The family of four people live happily in a small temporary house and rely on agricultural production for a living. Rice cultivation is the most important production in her family but the income from this doesn't cover completely all of the living expenses of her family. For that reason, Mrs. Loan steps up other production, such as growing corn, cassava as well as raising pigs and chickens. To have enough capital to expand animal husbandry, she has taken out a loan from the Anh Chi Em Program. This is the second loan she has received and she will use it to buy piglets and food for the pigs. Mrs. Loan hopes that her experience in breeding pigs, together with the knowledge she has collected from the training and the counselling of this program will make her investment go smoothly and improve her family's income significantly. She dreams that a more abundant life will soon knock her home's door and her children will have bright future.

Roberto aprovecha al m\u00e1ximo estos periodos para obtener las mejores ganancias. Durante las vacaciones, afortunadamente sus hijos y esposa lo acompa\u00f1an en los viajes. \n\nLa \u00fanica dificultad que enfrenta Roberto es la competencia en las distintas ferias donde trabaja, \u201cYa hay muchos panaderos y es muy dif\u00edcil obtener buenas ganancias aunque ya tambi\u00e9n son muchos a\u00f1os de experiencia y el buen sabor es el que nos identifica de los dem\u00e1s\u201d  coment\u00f3 Don Roberto.

He is 37, and has been married to his wife, Se\u00f1ora Jacqueline, for 17 years. The couple has five children, who all attend school. \r\n\r\nRoberto is the son of bakers, and from an early age was always working with the oven and firewood, and mixing sugar, flour, and other ingredients. He set up his own bakery when he started a family. Roberto had nothing back then, but his father provided an oven, some pans, and a small space where Roberto could begin selling bread at markets. Roberto worked diligently and within six months had returned everything his father had lent him. His business was off to a strong start, and in just a year he was selling bread at two markets. He now has spaces at four markets, each staffed by two employees.    \r\n\r\nDon Roberto is very pleased that he's able to provide jobs to a small group of people. But he still needs to be away from home for several days at a time, preparing to meet the demand from customers at the markets. Roberto takes advantage of these busy periods to boost his income, and is fortunate that the family can take vacations together. \r\n\r\nThe only problem for Roberto is competition at the various markets where he sells his bread. He observed, \"There are many bakers and it's tough to achieve good sales. Our years of experience and the great taste of our bread is what sets us apart from the competition.\" Roberto's grandparents had a wood-fired oven in their home, and their bread had a distinct taste. Bakers today use gas-fired ovens at the market site, and the flavor of their bread has changed. But Don Roberto has always striven to preserve the distinct flavor that has become a family tradition.  \r\n\r\nRoberto plans to use the funds from this loan to purchase flour, eggs, yeast, sugar, and other ingredients so he can sustain his market bakeries and achieve his goal: expanding the business and providing for his children, who want to study and prepare for professional careers. The oldest son is studying dentistry, while one of his younger brothers plans to be a doctor. One of Roberto's daughters wants to be a flight attendant, while the other girl hasn't yet decided on a career.

He takes care of the design with the use of software, and makes stickers of all sizes, with text that describes the business, names of musical groups, images for children, etc., to sell them. He does the work during the week in a room fixed up as a workshop and sales space in his house. \"Creativity is important in the design, and also one should be aware of brands, current musical groups, popular television programs, to design and print them, everything is important in the business...\" he says. His dream is to have a large business with a lot of sales. He wants to expand the business through the purchase of a plotter to work continuously. This is his first loan cycle with the institution in the 1 year he has been doing this work.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that David is asking for a loan to purchase a plotter to expand his business and have steady work.
