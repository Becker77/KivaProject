Meet Lydia, a fifty-two-year-old mum who is so humble, honest and a very hardworking. Lydia is a mother who really adores her family and will always do anything good so that they never go to bed with hungry stomachs. Lydia hails from the Kerugoya area of Kenya. Lydia never got the opportunity to advance her education and get a white collar job but this did not kill her dream of wanting to succeed in life. Lydia started farming and has been doing farming for the past six years. Throughout those years, she has gathered so much experience and all the farming techniques are at her fingertips. Lydia practices mixed farming on her farm and through the profits, she has managed to take care of her family's needs and give her children a good education because she believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success\u201d. \r\n\r\nLydia is also very enterprising. She is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 to start horticulture farming on her farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, Lydia wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits. \r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women like Lydia to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. Lydia hopes that through the loan, she will improve her living conditions. Lydia\u2019s dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year, she will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. Through this, she will be able to assure her children a secure future and uninterrupted learning because she will be able to pay tuition fees on time. Lydia is not a selfish woman and will also want to impact positively on society. That is why she will employ people to work for her on her horticulture farm, so that she can have an impact on society.\r\n\r\nHer hope is that 2015 will bring her success and good sales in

Ma'rifati is a young, single mother. She is divorced from her husband and has two small children to take care of. Her eldest daughter is 2 years old, her youngest is 7 months old. It is difficult for Ma'rifati to manage with two small children. She does not consider herself a single mother given that has two wonderful children.<br \/><br \/>Ma'rifati provides for her children by offering seamstress services out of her home. She takes orders for sewing women's clothing. She sews one dress for 35 Tajikistani Somoni (TJS). Ma'rifati is requesting a loan to repair her home and buy an overlock sewing machine.

For the past five years, she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been selling milk and crop farming. \r\n\r\nIrene passionately loves poultry farming. When asked what is most enjoyable about farming, her reply was, \u201cselling eggs.\u201d Her biggest challenge is the lack of funds to increase her poultry farming. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Poultry farming is the only business that thrives in the Kerugoya area because of the harsh weather patterns, so she wants to take full advantage of the poultry business. \r\n\r\nIrene is a member of Gatei Self-help Group and, through the group, she has received training in financial management and saving money. Through the loan, she will sell eggs to the local market and to her neighbors, hence improving her living conditions and getting out of the poverty situation she is currently in.

handsome husband, is blessed with 4 adorable children. For the past 6 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, farmers from their village and neighboring villages travel to her home to seek technical advice on the best farming techniques. Lucy is the breadwinner of her family, and this really pushes her to work hard so that her children will have a bright future and her parents will have a comfortable life. \r\n\r\nLucy is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming so that she can use the excess space on her land. She dreams of buying more land and increasing her  farm. Accessing funds is very difficult for a woman in Africa, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, Lucy is optimistic that her dream will be realized and her life will completely change. \r\n\r\nLucy will use the income to assure her children a bright future and will be able to pay tuition fees for her siblings who depend on her.

She is 46, single, and a resident of Tanza, Cavite, Philippines. She is a hardworking woman and has two types of business. She works hard to support herself and her aging parents.\r\n\r\nNilda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5-pesos-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells electronic pre-paid load for cellular mobile subscribers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of 2,500 PHP a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan that she will use to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda and other grocery stuff. With part of the loan, she will also pay for electronic load from leading telecommunication companies to sell at a retail price. She expects a higher demand for groceries and electronic load, especially this Christmas season. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial aid that will be given her, for it will surely help meet her everyday personal and household needs.\r\n\r\nNilda hopes to maintain and grow her business to sustain their needs. She wants to start saving for her old age. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1766501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Shaarkan has a secondary education. As an additional source of income for her family, she practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business in 1996 with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Shaarkan's hard work, she currently has 1 cow, 1 horse and 10 sheep on her farm. She also has a 1.92 hectare plot of land on which she annually grows beans, potatoes and perennial grasses for personal consumption and sale.

their families. They asked for a loan of 80,000 YER (Yemeni Rails) from AL-Amal Microfinance Bank.\r\nOne of these members is Zahra, who is 52 years old and very dynamic.

She lives with her husband and they work hard to be able to earn a living. It has been more than 15 years since Geghecik became engaged in cattle breeding, in aviculture, in breeding a livestock of cows, and in cultivation of several vegetables (wheat, potatoes.)\r\n\r\nWith the help of her husband, she realizes the agricultural products in the local market, which is a very important source of their income. To continue running her agribusiness in a sustainable way, Geghecik needs a loan of USD 2,000 to purchase 10 piglets and potatoes needed for the farm. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back. However, thanks to the hard work during the recent times, Geghecik was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Geghecik and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1766464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 10 piglets and potatoes needed for her farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Gyulagarak village, Lori region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2014-12-28T17:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-11T17:50:16Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Geghecik","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":101.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":102.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":104.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":104.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":105.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":107.43},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":108.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":109.14},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":110.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":112.06},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":112.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":113.93},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":114.36},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":116.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":117.18},{"due_date":"2016-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":118.26},{"due_date":"2016-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":119.74},{"due_date":"2016-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":120.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.9},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.86},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.06},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.52},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.93},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.36},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.58},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.18},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.26},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.74},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":820697,"name":"Melinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melinda is 60 years old and married with four children.

She is a lovely mother of three children who are currently in school.\r\n\r\nTo earn a living, she manages and operates a farming business on rice farm land which is located near her house. So far, she has been involved in this business for twenty years. On average, she is able to earn USD $2.00 per day.\r\n\r\nSan wants to gain access to household energy at a reduced monthly rate by purchasing a solar energy home system.

Through milk, eggs, maize, and a variety of food crops, he has been able to earn a decent income. \r\n\r\nOf all the activities he is involved in, dairy farming is close to his heart. He passionately loves dairy farming and to prove this he has even nicknamed one of his cows. Feeding his cows is his hobby. Waking up every day in the morning to milk his cows makes him feel fulfilled.

The importance of a chaff cutter is to cut hay and straw into small pieces before mixing it with forage to feed the cows. Through the loan his cows will never have digestion complications and also the cows will never reject food and hence he will have increasing milk productivity. With your loan his cows will increase milk productivity, and through increased income and profit margins he will meet the basic needs of his family. His family will enjoy an improved diet, and apart from that he will secure the future of his children by paying tuition fees for them since they depend on him.\r\n\r\nSupport Rufus with a loan today!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":334.27,"image":{"id":1791495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a chaff cutter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-12T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-11T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.21,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rufus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.78,"local_amount":2558.23,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2615.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262759},{"amount":32.69,"local_amount":2905.77,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2970.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264956},{"amount":34.78,"local_amount":3091.61,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3160.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601127},{"amount":32.94,"local_amount":2927.88,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2993.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459588},{"amount":35.97,"local_amount":3249.95,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3322.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.59,"payment_id":681378004},{"amount":36.12,"local_amount":3286.2,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3359.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.85,"payment_id":696587672},{"amount":124.78,"local_amount":11693.38,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":11954.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.77,"payment_id":711505986}],"funded_date":"2015-02-11T18:21:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tom D"}},{"id":826944,"name":"Manizha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manizha is a repeat client.

She is 46, a resident of Tanza, Cavite, Philippines and married with two children. She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs and to send her children to school. <br \/><br \/>Rosalita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of Php 900 a day. <br \/><br \/>To help her continue operations of her general store business she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda and other grocery stuff. She expects a higher demand of groceries this holiday season. Her earnings are their source to meet their daily expenses and to send her children to school. She thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. She wishes everyone a Blessed Christmas!<br \/><br \/>Rosalita hopes to sustain and grow her business to improve their quality of life. She strives very hard to send her children to school and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. <br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Maia has been approved for a loan within the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. She will purchase all needed tools and continue providing her lovely service.
