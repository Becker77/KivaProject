Unfortunately, because of a lack of economic resources, they couldn't study and they saw the necessity to work at an early age in order to help with the expenses of the home.\r\n\r\nCurrently, they fight for getting their family ahead and the emotional needs of their children. Thanks to her eagerness to get ahead, the coordinator is Tomasa. As an economic activity, she sells dairy products like: milk, cheese, fresh cheese, sour cream on foot and in her house. She works some ten hours daily, offering her products so that in the not-so-distant future she can obtain better income.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the loan is to invest in working capital and to buy more dairy products to be able to satisfy the demand of her customers. Las Palomas are thankful for the help that the Kiva investors bring to the people of scant resources and poor countries like Nicaragua to have a dignified means of work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1767455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She lives with her husband and two children. Ani, with the help of her husband, is engaged in the cultivation of wheat and breeding of cows, sheep, and calves.\r\n\r\nTo continue her agribusiness in a sustainable way, Ani needs a loan of $3,000 to purchase two cows and fertilizer. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, Ani was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments.

Therefore, Merry has applied for a Kiva loan. This loan will help her to buy the relevant items for her business purpose so that she can provide better services to her customers.

Excel Infant School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nExcel Infant School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

Maurice works as a business owner for a living. His community of Kitanda D village does not have access to clean water. The water that is used for drinking and cooking is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases. Maurice is a friendly member of the community, and has been elected Promoter by his village to help its members obtain safe drinking water.\n\nAs a volunteer Promoter, Maurice represents the community on Kiva\u2019s website and educates the community on how to protect their families from unsafe drinking water by using a chlorine dispenser system. Maurice and 2 other promoters in his community, namely Beverlyne and Grace, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Maurice wants to be a promoter because he believes that the chlorine will kill bacteria in water making it safe for drinking, thus alleviating water-borne diseases.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Maurice\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1791552,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To support an innovative water treatment technology - chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2015-01-12T22:40:54Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-11T22:40:54Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maurice ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beverlyne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1350,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-18T02:49:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":821896,"name":"Meteda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Meteda is an inspirational salesperson who lives on the Northern shore of Papua.

For the education in the village, they have up to 5th grade and for upper studies, students have to go to town or other villages. Included in photo, Daw San (second from right), is a farmer. She is married and her husband as well is a farmer. She lives together with four children who are all students. She mostly does cropping and plants seasonal foods by renting someone else's farm.

is a freshman at the American University of Central Asia, Department of Sociology. Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI applied for the Sociology Program. I believe that my profession will enable me to fulfill all my desires to help others, to continuously expand my knowledge base and skills. All my life I have participated in extracurricular activities at school including volunteering. I have striven for academic excellence, always wishing to make the most of my school education.\r\n \r\nLast year I finished the one-year program of New Generation Academy of AUCA. I was one of the 70 winners of a full Scholarship for this Program. Thanks to this Program I became stronger morally, purposeful, and it gave me a chance to enter AUCA. Also I was awarded a Best Effort Award for my academic excellence at NGA. \r\n\r\nMy family made many sacrifices to allow me to focus on my studies. Now I have an opportunity to become the first person in my family to attend university, though I am in need of financial aid. I have five siblings and I am the eldest one; the others study at school or go to kindergarten. My parents hadn\u2019t conditions to have a higher education and were forced to do always physical work. They grow vegetables and beans in the field and sell them at the local markets. So my family\u2019s income is unstable and depends on weather conditions. Recently my mother gave a birth to my youngest sibling and stays at home.\r\n \r\nApplying for a Kiva loan, I ask for help not only for me but also for my family, as we are one unit, and its future depends on each member of it. Getting a degree means for me changing the future of me, my parents and my siblings.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1789423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She travels by small boat cruising the longest river in the island to reach her students. Her village, Tumbang Malawan, is not covered by electricity. Even though the government has distributed solar home lighting systems to some households in the area, they still require portable solar lamps to check their farm at night and do other activities after the sun goes down.\n \nTo increase her income, Emeriana has joined Kopernik\u2019s Tech Kiosk network to sell solar lights and water filters. She will use the loan to buy stock and grow her business. \n\nEmeriana believes that when she sells the technologies, she is bringing positive improvements to the people she sells to.

The city is known for its beautiful beaches that are visited all year and for being an incomparably beautiful city with many tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nThis is where Gladys, age 72, lives.  She is in a common-law marriage, and they have ten grown children.  One of them still lives with them.  Her husband is a merchant.\r\n\r\nGladys is a woman who likes to make her own way.  She and her husband have a store selling provisions at their house.  She sells products like rice, sugar, cooking oils, detergent, fruit and vegetables, meat, fish, sweets, variety items, and many other products that meet her customers\u2019 needs.  Her customers can get everything at her store.  That is why her clientele increases more every day.  They work every day from 6:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m., and sometimes they work later.  They have had the store for over 30 years.  The business is how they earn a living.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to stock her store more.  She will buy rice, sugar, cooking oil, and detergent, among other products.  She has been in the communal bank since it started.  She likes it because of the help provided with the loans.  Her dream is to be in good health.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1790918,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, cooking oil, and detergent, among other products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2015-01-13T00:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-12T00:00:08Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1307.18,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":108.93},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":108.93},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":108.93},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":108.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":108.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":108.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":108.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":108.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":108.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":108.93},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":108.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.41},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.41},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.41},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.41},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":220.84,"local_amount":217.86,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":220.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611785713},{"amount":220.84,"local_amount":217.86,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:29:26Z","rounded_local_amount":220.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624232386},{"amount":220.83,"local_amount":217.86,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":220.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636218129},{"amount":331.23,"local_amount":326.79,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":331.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649569775},{"amount":220.82,"local_amount":217.86,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":220.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665050369},{"amount":110.44,"local_amount":108.95,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":110.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681348255}],"funded_date":"2015-01-18T16:19:56Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:51:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":818158,"name":"Geoffrey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geoffrey is a married man.

He has applied for a loan of 3,000,000 UGX. He is 41 years old and is a single father. His two children are 18 and 16 years old respectively and are both in school. He has no dependents.\n\nDennis is hardworking. He is a farmer of maize and beans and also trades in local brews (enguri) to supplement the income from agriculture. He works eight hours a day. His stall of local brew is in Mirambi, Rubirizi District, alongside the road. He started these businesses to raise money to support his family economically.\n\nDennis says he will use the funds from this loan to buy more local brews to get more after-sale profits.

She is 39 years old and has a civil union with 2 grown children, one of whom lives with them. Her husband is a businessman. Aid\u00e9 wanted to earn her own income so she has various jobs. She works in a house as a domestic employee but in the afternoons and weekends she has a small locale outside of her home where she sells snacks such as corviches (a seasoned fish nugget), empanadas (turnovers), juices and other food. She also prepares appetizers, sandwiches, and meals for parties and social events. She generally does this once per month, although this month because of the holidays she has many contracts to fulfil. She has more than 10 years of experience and her businesses are going well.<br \/><br \/>This loan will be used to buy supplies to prepare her food. She has been a member of the credit group for 9 years because she likes the loans as they are of great help.

According to her, farming will give her everything she has always dreamed of. Jackline is a smallholder farmer from Kitale in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. She owns a quarter-acre farm where she practices mixed farming. On the farm she keeps dairy animals and grows maize and vegetables. She has ten years of experience in farming. \n\nJackline is seeking a loan to expand her horticulture farm. She will buy good quality seeds of a variety of vegetables and fruits to plant. She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output. Loans for smallholder farmers with little, irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. A few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Jackline. Through a group of ten members called Excel Self-Help Group, Jackline has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. \n\nAccording to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholder farmers, both unskilled and semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Jackline because the institution believes that women, too, are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200.39,"image":{"id":1788262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy seeds for her horticulture farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-13T00:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-12T00:40:07Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.56,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1720.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1770.61},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1822.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1875.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1930.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1986.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2044.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2104.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2229.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2294.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2361.7},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2430.72},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2501.76},{"due_date":"2016-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2574.87},{"due_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2650.12},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2727.57},{"due_date":"2016-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2807.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.37},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.57},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.35},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.69},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.13,"local_amount":3923.07,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4010.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262726},{"amount":19.52,"local_amount":1734.78,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1773.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601091},{"amount":55.74,"local_amount":4954.82,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5065.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459556},{"amount":20.69,"local_amount":1882.3,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1924.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.49,"payment_id":696587641},{"amount":56.75,"local_amount":5317.18,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5435.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.07,"payment_id":711505950}],"funded_date":"2015-01-27T16:35:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":824247,"name":"Monica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Monica is a thirty-five-year-old hardworking and energetic mother of one lovely child.

Meet Geoffrey, a 44-year-old, enterprising, humble, and hardworking farmer. He is from Kitale, Kenya, an area known because it\u2019s the \u201cbread basket of Kenya.\u201d Geoffrey is a proud father of five lovely children, whom he really loves and adores and will do anything within his power to comfortably care for. Geoffrey has been practicing farming for the last five years. Through farming he has been able to earn a decent and honest income, and comfortably provide the basic needs for his family. Geoffrey practices mixed farming--that is, crop and dairy farming. Through these two farming activities, he always puts food on the table for his family.\n\nAlthough Geoffrey has been making profits by selling vegetables and milk to the nearby markets and neighbors, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious man. He has been facing a challenge of transporting his produce to the market and the timely delivery of products. Geoffrey sells perishable products, such as milk and vegetables, and he does not have proper storage facilities. Therefore, he needs to make sure that the products reach the market on time. Because of poor feeder roads and the transport network in his area, this is a challenge he has faced. That is why he is seeking a loan to buy another motorbike. The motorbike will help him in transporting his products to the market.\n\nAs a result of this loan, Geoffrey will be able to timely deliver his products. He will earn more profits, because he will be selling his products at a high price because they are still fresh. Geoffrey's dream is to be able to secure the future of his children and to be able to improve his living conditions. Through improved profits, Geoffrey is sure that his dream will be achieved. He will also have a positive impact in his society through creating employment, because he intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike. Geoffrey is patiently waiting for your kindness, so that he can realize his dream.\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1789247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy another motorbike to transport his products to the market while they are fresh","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-13T00:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-12T00:40:08Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Geoffrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":824350,"name":"Steven","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Steven is a first-time borrower at UGAFODE Microfinance and is a cattle keeper.

The profits from the business will be used to buy food for home consumption.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.
