The silver nitrate-infused ceramic element removes and destroys bacteria and similar agents of waterborne diseases. Va's village takes water from relatively shallow wells and from local streams; however, the water from natural sources in his village is dirty and unsuitable for drinking without treatment.  \r\n\r\nEven though some people in the village, including Va\u2019s, are able to buy bottled water, the water filter increases disposable income to users by decreasing the amount of money used to purchase bottled water.

The nearby villages also suffer from dirty and unsafe drinking water. Chai is excited that she, like her group members, was able to purchase a water filter. Most families report a threefold reduction in diarrhea after they begin using the filter; this is because the filter removes bacteria and other waterborne diseases. The water filter also increases disposable income to users like Chai due to the decreased cost of purchasing charcoal, by decreasing time spent foraging for wood, and decreasing  the amount of money used to  purchase bottled water. The filter is guaranteed for 2 years, though most find the filter works from 3-5

They all live in the same village and share very solid ties of solidarity.\r\n\r\nMs. Manding (standing to the right with her hand raised) is the star borrower of the group.

suffering from poverty and malnutrition. Most of the people make their livelihood by working as labourers in the agricultural fields belonging to farmers in neighboring and more distant villages. \r\n\r\nThomas has been practicing farming on a small inherited piece of land for the past six years. To afford a decent and comfortable life for his parents and siblings, he has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from his farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, he has been engaging in other small personal businesses. The Nyamira area has high demand for poultry products. Like many farmers from his region, Thomas finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and he stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d \r\n\r\nHis biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. He lacks funds to increase his poultry farming, so he is seeking a loan of 50,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being from a marginalized community, he finds that accessing funds is very challenging. However, through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, he feels relieved knowing that his dream will be achieved, and he will be able to buy more poultry. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, he will be able to provide more eggs and poultry products to his neighbors and to the local market.

Juntos han formado una familia con tres hijos de los cuales dos de ellos se encuentran estudiando el preescolar y el mayor su educaci\u00f3n primaria.\n\nHace siete a\u00f1os Alicia abri\u00f3 una peque\u00f1a tienda de abarrotes, en ella surgi\u00f3 la idea de tener un negocio porque de alguna manera quer\u00eda ayudar con los gastos de su hogar y vivir cerca de la calle m\u00e1s transitada de su comunidad resultaba ser un beneficio extra para el tipo de actividad. Para tener el capital suficiente, Alicia comenz\u00f3 a vender elotes preparados y esquites afuera de su casa en una peque\u00f1a mesita donde tambi\u00e9n colocaba una lona para cubrirse del sol. Durante seis meses ahorr\u00f3 todas sus ganancias que utiliz\u00f3 para comprar dulces y refrescos.

The members are pleased to belong to a place where the residents help one another.  <br \/><br \/>Do\u00f1a Alicia is a cheerful and hardworking woman who gets along well with the people around her.  She is 31 years old and in a common-law relationship with Sr. Ernesto, who works by building houses.  Together they have formed their family that includes three children, two of whom are studying in preschool.  The oldest child is in elementary school.  <br \/><br \/>Seven years ago, Alicia opened a small grocery store.  She came up with the idea to have a business because she wanted to have some way of helping with the household expenses.  Since she lives near one of the busiest streets in her community, she thought it would be an extra benefit to have this type of business.  In order to have enough capital, Alicia began selling corn on the cob and corn salad outside of her house from a small table that was covered by a tarp so that she could protect herself from the sun.  Over a period of six months, she saved all of her earnings and used the money to buy sweets and soft drinks.  Her earnings gradually increased and she formally started her grocery store.  <br \/><br \/>The loans from VisionFund have allowed her to keep her business stocked with merchandise such as bread, eggs, milk, sugar, dairy products, detergents, and other products.  Do\u00f1a Alicia is very pleased and appreciative of the opportunity and the support she has received through the loans.  Her dream is to grow her business even more so that she can continue contributing to the household expenses and, most importantly, to her children\u2019s educational expenses because she wants to see them become professionals.  <br \/><br \/>The other members of the group, just like Do\u00f1a Alicia, are extremely grateful to VisionFund and Kiva because of the loans they requested for their businesses over the course of several years.  Don Severiano, Irma, and Don Jos\u00e9 will invest in the raising and fattening of sheep.  This business helps them to improve their quality of life and that of their families.  <br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken near Don Severiano\u2019s house with his animals.

This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 6 years that she has been doing this work independently. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Isabel is asking for a loan to purchase a collar sewing machine to improve her creations.

The prevailing geological conditions of the village make it extremely suitable for dairy farming. The major challenge he faces is a lack of funds to push his dairy farming a notch higher.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. The additional cow will help in the use of pasture, and will increase milk production and availability to produce more byproducts. Through this loan, Paul will be able to challenge the existing norms and bring better and advanced dairy farming practices to his village, thus becoming a torchbearer for change in his village for others to follow.

Meet Jonah, a 31-year-old father of one adorable child who always brings a pleasant feeling when he is at home. He hails from the Kitale area of Kenya, an area that is the bread basket of Kenya because half the food Kenya consumes comes from this area.\r\n\r\nBeing a father comes with lots of responsibility, and feeding his family and siblings requires a lot of hard work; hence, Jonah has to put in extra efforts to comfortably take care of his family. Jonah started farming just after finishing high school since he never advanced his education. Because of the high unemployment rate, he ventured into farming, and he has never regretted this because of the profits he has been making.\r\n\r\nJonah practices mixed farming and is regarded as one of the hardworking farmers in his village because he is able to juggle between keeping dairy cows and also doing crop farming. Jonah is a visionary and an enterprising person and has always wanted to do dairy farming on a large scale, but one of the challenges he has faced is lack of enough capital. That is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan Jonah is confident that his life will be transformed and his dream of providing a secure future for his children will be achieved. Jonah is relieved to know that his life can be secured through partners such as Kiva lenders who help small-scale and aspiring men such as Jonah."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1791665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-13T14:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-12T14:40:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":41600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1789.14},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1841.43},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1895.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1950.63},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2007.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2066.31},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2126.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2188.85},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2252.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2318.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2386.42},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2456.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2527.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2601.83},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2677.87},{"due_date":"2016-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2756.13},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2836.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2919.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.43},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.27},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.28},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.72},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.86},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.71},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.58},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.47},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.39},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":827252,"name":"Las Emprendedoras Del Barrio San Antonio Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teresa (representante que aparece al lado derecho de la foto) es una mujer muy optimista, le gusta apoyar a su familia, ella se cas\u00f3 de muy temprana edad tiene ahora 26 a\u00f1os y tiene dos hijos uno de 7 a\u00f1os y otro de un a\u00f1o y cinco meses., vive junto a su familia en una comunidad de Solol\u00e1. \nTeresa con el af\u00e1n de ayudar a su esposo, para la generaci\u00f3n de ingresos econ\u00f3micos, pues desde hace cuatro a\u00f1os, se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de productos elaborada con mostacilla, pues por la misma necesidad que tiene su familia, la obligo a realizar este oficio ella lo aprendi\u00f3 con su suegra, pues es as\u00ed como Teresa ayuda a su familia  para salir adelante.\nTeresa como toda mam\u00e1, es responsable de velar por las necesidades de un hogar.

Her husband's a security guard.\r\n\r\nAida learned sewing and tailoring several years ago in an academy in town.  She started a small tailor shop in her home to earn her own income and make the most of her sewing and tailoring knowledge.  She earns a living making all types of clothing for women, men, and children, although she admits that what she likes most is making clothing for women or little girls because there are more designs and she learns even more from them.
