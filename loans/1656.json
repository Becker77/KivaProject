children. She has a high school education and has been working in agriculture and animal husbandry for about 10 years as the primary source of income for her family. Thanks to her hard work and purposefulness, she currently has 1.32 hectares of her own land where she grows cotton, as well as four cows.

He enjoys seeing clients coming back for more of his products and he really feels satisfied. Although Dominic has been making profits through farming, he has always wanted to do poultry farming. The main challenge he has encountered is a lack of funds to get his business off the ground. Dominic is seeking a loan to buy quality breeds of poultry. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Kitale and is a business that can be done on a part-time basis to earn extra income. Dominic does not worry too much about competition because the market for poultry products is good; chicken is a popular meal for many people and this can be seen if you visit any fast food joint. With this loan, Dominic is confident that his income will increase and this will allow a permanent change in his life. He plans to buy different breeds of broilers and layers and will be selling eggs and meat to the local market and other major markets in Kenya. He also plans to start breeding, which will help increase the number of poultry on his farm. Other than profits from selling eggs, poultry feathers, and poultry meat, Dominic will also benefit from using the poultry manure, which is an excellent source of nutrients for his farm. Through this loan, he will assure his siblings and large family of a secure future and improved living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1793487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-13T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-12T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.92,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dominic","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.47,"local_amount":3153.11,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824802},{"amount":16.78,"local_amount":1491.23,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1524.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264961},{"amount":16.78,"local_amount":1491.4,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1524.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601133},{"amount":18.4,"local_amount":1635.33,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1671.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459592},{"amount":17.64,"local_amount":1594.96,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1630.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.3,"payment_id":681378009},{"amount":18.68,"local_amount":1699.58,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1737.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.44,"payment_id":696587675},{"amount":97.33,"local_amount":8934.39,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":9133.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.18,"payment_id":731022807}],"funded_date":"2015-01-18T14:38:53Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":821945,"name":"Orlando Ivan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Orlando tiene 26 a\u00f1os de edad, es un joven  de car\u00e1cter tranquilo, el vive con su madre y unas hermana que asiste al colegio, Orlando reside en el campo en un lugar muy lejano a la ciudad, por este motivo Orlando comenta que su visi\u00f3n es de trabajar en la agricultura y la ganader\u00eda y mas no estudiar ya que sobre todo por motivo que su no cuenta con los recursos econ\u00f3micos para darle el estudio a su hijo, Orlando necesita el cr\u00e9dito para invertirlo en la compra de toretes para obtener sus ingresos y seguir ayudando a su madre en los gastos del hogar y apoyar a su hermana para que termine sus estudios.","en":"Orlando, 26, is a young man with a quiet disposition.

She says this is her second year in Pro Mujer and she joined by invitation through a representative of the institution who visited her at home.  The business she currently runs is sale of freeze-dried potato and potatoes, which she started 20 years ago.

He's working 12 to 14 hours a day to fulfill his dream. Charles lives with his wife and says that they only want to have more children when they are sure that they can raise them without worry of where their next meal will come from, or forcing them to leave school because they can't provide for them. Charles owns a small plot of inherited land on which he has been practicing mixed farming for more than 10 years. He grows a variety of crops and keeps dairy cows and poultry. The income he makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet his family's expenses. He needs to improve his income level, and that is why he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Charles passionately loves dairy farming and, as he likes to put it, \u201cdairy farming is close to my heart.\u201d He plans not to buy just an ordinary cow but to buy a quality breed of cow that will produce between 10-20 liters of milk a day. The additional milk will result in additional income and hence improved living conditions. The income generated from selling the milk will be used to fully repay the loan and also go towards the education of his children. He will also benefit from cow manure which will be used in increasing the fertility level of his farm, hence increasing productivity.

This ambitious father of two has one goal in life and that is to succeed. Daniel started farming five years ago and his primary income source has been milk and maize farming. He is thankful to God that his business has been profitable so far. Daniel is seeking a loan to jump-start horticulture farming. Land in Kitale is very fertile, so the major challenge facing farmers like Daniel is usually weed management. In a country characterized by food insecurity, Daniel sees a big opportunity to start a business growing vegetables and other food crops.

She is married to Angelo, a hotel housekeeper, and she has two children who are both in the elementary level. She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal, household needs and to send her children to school. \r\n\r\nLeamor operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store that sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 800 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan, which she will use to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda and other grocery stuff. She expects a higher demand for her grocery items this Christmas season. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her and for a good return on her investment. This will surely help her support her family's daily needs. \r\n\r\nLeamor hopes to maintain and grow her business so they can have a better life. She strives hard to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1770982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items, beverages and toiletries to sell.

With the loan from Kiva, he would like to buy fertilizer to grow maize. The profits from the harvest will be used to renovate his house.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

At the present time, Kobiljon is experiencing financial difficulties because livestock prices dropped, making it disadvantageous to sell livestock.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

He decided that he will be independent and contribute to his community by practicing mixed farming. \n\nRonald is blessed with four lovely children who he refers to as his \"heart beat.\u201d His primary sources of income are maize and poultry farming, as well as some personal business that he does to supplement his meager income. Deciding to practice poultry farming for Ronald was not difficult. \u201cI was brought up with chickens raised by my grandfather and grandmother,\u201d Ronald said. \u201cIt is in my blood.\u201d For the past five years, Ronald has been earning a decent income from poultry farming. However, the demand is overwhelming and he wants to increase his poultry, but the biggest challenge is lack of funds. \n\nHe is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. Poultry farming has become one of the most important aspects of agriculture in Kenya because it creates business opportunity for entrepreneurs and it\u2019s a kind of business that can never dry up. Poultry farming is a less strenuous activity that is profitable. Many poultry farmers find a sense of fulfillment having hens all over their homestead. The hens lay eggs that can be consumed or sold.

An investment by AgDevCo has allowed ECA to purchase a state-of-the-art maize mill, designed for use in rural areas, so it can process the farmers\u2019 crop before selling it on. \n\nThe group in total farms 15 hectares of land. All farming is done manually. The farmers require finance to purchase vital farming inputs - all of them purchase seed and some choose to also purchase fertilizer.\n\nAccess to a group loan of 28,460 Meticais (892 USD) equates to an average of 2,587 Meticais (81 USD) per participant- enough for the farmers to purchase from ECA the inputs they need.\n\nFarming conditions in the area are extremely tough with only intermittent rainfall. However, since becoming participants on the Chozvo scheme all the farmers report life becoming easier. They can afford good quality fertilizer, which is purchased from ECA. The farmers\u2019 crops are also bought by ECA every week - they come to their farms so the participants do not need to walk long distances to find a market for their crops.\n\nSince ECA\u2019s arrival into their community, and with access to funds to purchase the necessary inputs, the farmers have seen their yields and incomes increasing threefold. This is allowing them to invest in their farms, buy motorbikes and send their children to school. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1784802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To pay for farming inputs to increase maize crops yield","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Catandica, Manica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-18.25 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":261,"posted_date":"2015-01-13T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-12T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martinho Jairosse ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edson Q.

Meet Callen, a very hardworking, energetic young farmer. Although she has only farmed for the past five years, she is working hard and learning good farming practices. Through the profits she has made, she has been able to take care of her family and provide basic needs for her parents. \r\n\r\nCallen lives near Nyamusi in the Nyamira area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming. Maize is a very common crop in Kenya and is a staple food for many who regularly eat \u201cugali,\u201c or hard porridge cooked from maize. One can usually buy sifted maize flour in the market, but its cost is higher because of the processing. Flour can be less expensive, however, if it is milled directly using a posho mill. \r\n\r\nThe Nyamusi area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a great number of people. The main problem here is that the posho mill keeps breaking down so farmers cannot grind their maize. Callen intends to change this by buying another posho mill to serve the area. She will buy an electric, rather than diesel, posho mill, as they are more reliable. Hopefully breakdowns will be few and far between. \r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, Callen is applying for a 60,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy a mill. Profits derived from the mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan. In the next two years, Callen sees herself established and running more than one posho mill. She patiently waits for your kindness. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1793638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a posho mill","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-13T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-12T21:20:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Callen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":114.97,"local_amount":10219.74,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":10496.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262765},{"amount":560.03,"local_amount":49780.26,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":51130.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601138}],"funded_date":"2015-01-18T02:23:07Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":827380,"name":"Aigerim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aigerim is a freshman at the American University of Central Asia, Department of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

We keep in touch with my father, but he doesn\u2019t help us financially, he often helps us in other ways.\r\n\r\nDespite the small salary, my mother always  emphasized a quality education. She often bought us various interesting books, which subsequently had a positive impact on my great love of reading in the areas of  foreign classics and human psychology.  I am interested in human beings and want to learn how  people think and live.\r\n\r\nI finished the High School with advanced study of English, and with confidence can say that this school has provided a solid foundation of knowledge and skills, which helps me to solve life's problems. My dream is to get a degree at AUCA and be proud of my university and  knowledge.

Nana is an orange farmer with 30 years experience and supplements his income by growing cocoa. He sells his oranges to local fruit processing companies but sells his cocoa beans to neighbors. His wife supports him in his farming business, which Nana entered because his family gave him a large plot of fertile land. He hopes to increase his farm size in the next five years by reinvesting part of his farming income, but needs financial assistance to undertake routine farm maintenance and maximize crop yield and income. He has requested this loan to prune his orange trees, and buy fly traps and fertilizer.  Nana thanks all his lenders for their generosity.

","en":"Zarrina is a single 27-year-old young woman. She does not have a college education because her parents did not have a financial ability to support her university studies. Zarrina learned the seamstress profession by herself 5 years ago and started to earn a living. She sews women's national-style dresses at her home.

","en":"Gulzhazy is 34 years old, a widow and mother of 4 school-age children. Gulzhazy has a secondary education and has been been involved in animal husbandry and farming for 9 years. Today, Gulzhazy has 2 cows and 50 sheep. She grows beans for sales on 2.0 hectares of land. She knows the method of running an agricultural business and can effectively invest finances into it. Her combined monthly income amounts to about 10,000 som (KGS), and this money is catastrophically insufficient for Gulzhazy and her children to have a decent life. Because agriculture represents Gulzhazy's sole source of income, Gulzhazy plans to continue developing it. She requested a loan in the amount of 90,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy livestock feed. Gulzhazy intends to use the earnings from the loan to further develop her business, which will allow her to improve her family's welfare."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":516.67,"image":{"id":1790339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy livestock feed in order to grow her business and increase her income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Balbal village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-01-13T22:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-12T22:20:04Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":51.34,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulzhazy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":516.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":516.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":516.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":465.33,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":51.34,"payment_id":752025609}],"funded_date":"2015-01-17T13:38:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":827408,"name":"Saorb's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A local farmer living in Banteay Meanchey province, Saorb is 59 years old and a mother of one child.

My father is the only breadwinner in our family. He works at the judicial department. He serves as a good example for me and I want to be as smart as he is. Since the start of school times he has been supporting me, teaching, showing how to do something and doing sport together. This is why I think that it\u2019s my turn to do something for my father, by which I mean being a good, educated and well-brought up son of his. \r\n\r\nMy mother is a housewife. She does household work and helps my sister to do her homework. She is so attentive and she used to follow my achievements at school. Now I am also very active at AUCA. I took part in Initiation 2014, a New Year's charity concert for orphanages, Orientation Week 2014 and many other events. The most important event for me was a charity concert dedicated to one girl who had kidney cancer. We were able to raise money for her operation.\r\n\r\nI love AUCA. I feel myself and at home here. I am ambitious and have great plans for the future. I believe that AUCA will direct me to the correct path, which will help me to study, to live and to work in a proper way. I hope that after graduation I will be one of the youth leaders, a good specialist in my field and the caring son of my family and my

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I was in the first grade, I was [struggling] with a lot of appearance hang-ups, my grandfather used to teach me letters, and numbers extra from my school. Going to school was a big struggle for me as I wore old clothes because my family couldn\u2019t buy me new ones. I studied hard and became the best student in the class, which caused the change of my classmates\u2019 attitudes towards me. At that time I understood that education was my power and my protection.\r\n\r\nIn the 7th grade I went to the Turkish High School for girls and moved to the town. It\u2019s the time when I left my home and began living separate from my parents. It was so difficult to adapt at the new school, to meet new classmates, but I am too thankful to my high school for its good education and family spirit. It taught me to be strong in any circumstances, be a very goal determined person. My struggles paid off after graduation, because I got a Gold Certificate from the president of Kyrgyzstan for getting high scores in the national testing to enter universities.\r\n\r\nNow I am a freshman at AUCA, it is the most prestigious university in Central Asia, not everybody can pass its entrance exams. As we have for whole my life, we are short of money and I am applying for a Kiva loan to pay my university tuition. I think that AUCA will help me in realizing my dreams: to be a good lawyer and then to be a Minister of Justice of Kyrgyzstan. I want to fight for people's rights and make good changes in this sphere. I hope to get a loan and be able to act.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1793711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Introducing Margaret, a 25-year-old mother who is full of energy and a very hard worker. She hails from the Ndaragwa area of Kenya, an area with good and favorable weather patterns that support farming. She is the mother of three children who are under her care from her marriage. Margaret completed her secondary school education thanks to the financial support and effort of her parents, but never advanced. This never killed the spirit she has for succeeding in life. <br \/><br \/>Margaret has been farming for the past six years and through mixed farming, she has been able to take care of her family. She loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of her cows. Although Margaret passionately loves farming, she faces the challenge of water shortages.

The other farmers in the group are Muhammad, Agus, Mumu and Ari. They are standing in front of a BIRU bio-digester. Arul has a family with two children. All of them live in Benteng Gajah, a small village in Maros, Indonesia.\n\nArul is a member of Masagalae Farmer Group which is assisted by KSU Bulusaukang (a local cooperative \u2013 biogas construction partner of Yayasan Rumah Energi\/YRE). He has been running cow-fattening farming for more than a year. He also operates a small-scale vegetable farming in his garden. His business is going well. He was concerned to see the cow dung polluting the water in the surrounding neighborhood. He knew that with proper processing, the cow dung could be a valuable product.\n\nAfter socialized by YRE and KSU Bulusaukang about Household Biogas (BIRU) program, he was interested in using biogas. He become more convinced after hearing testimonies from his Masagale friends, who had already built BIRU bio-digesters and were satisfied with the result. Arul saw an opportunity to reduce his dependence on non- renewable cooking gas. In addition, he also wants to use bio-slurry (biogas residue) to produce vermin compost fertilizer and sell it.

In order to repay the loan Rudolfo will have the help of his wife as she earns money making costume jewelry (made of beads). \r\n\r\nRodolfo and his wife would support making payments on this loan. They do this because they love their family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":346.91,"image":{"id":1793900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She began this activity because she liked it, it was a small business which she was able to grow by buying more vegetables thanks to the loan she got from Adicla. She works in this activity because it has helped her generate the necessary income to help her parents. With her earnings she has been able to save a little to cover her needs.

She has the equivalent of a high school education.  Fifteen years ago, she became involved in animal husbandry, an activity which constitutes an additional source of income for her family.

She lives in a village where there is no piped water or electricity connection. <br \/><br \/>Naomi has been doing farming for the past eight years, and through profits from farming, she has been able to support her family. Naomi loves dairy farming. She has nicknamed one of her cows. She feels really proud whenever she is around her dairy cows. <br \/><br \/>Although she makes profits from farming, this humble mother is faced with challenges of harvesting rainwater. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy a water tank. The loan will assist Naomi to harvest rainwater that is always wasted, and will be able to use it during dry spells to water her farm. Through the loan, Naomi will have water for home consumption, and this will assist her to save time that she used to spend going to fetch water. <br \/><br \/>Naomi is very ambitious, and she plans to increase her vegetable production because she will have enough water to use in vegetable farming. Profits from selling vegetables will be used in improving her living conditions and also assuring her children of a secure future.<br \/><br \/>With your help, Naomi can get ahead!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":585.61,"image":{"id":1793736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a water tank.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ndaragwa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-14T01:40:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-13T01:40:31Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.2,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":158.27,"local_amount":14189.41,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":14449.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264964},{"amount":112.73,"local_amount":10107.18,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":10292.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459596},{"amount":120.1,"local_amount":10967.24,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":11168.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.23,"payment_id":696587681},{"amount":188.31,"local_amount":17239.25,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:38Z","rounded_local_amount":17555.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.97,"payment_id":752110995}],"funded_date":"2015-01-14T06:36:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":822084,"name":"Genoveva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Genoveva de 30 a\u00f1os de edad vive con su esposo y sus 2 hijos una ni\u00f1a de 3 a\u00f1os y un var\u00f3n de 11 a\u00f1os de edad en vivienda propia.
