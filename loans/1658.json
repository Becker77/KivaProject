He has a specialized secondary education. Sobirdjon is involved in animal husbandry. This is the primary type of activity, with which the village residents can earn a living. Sobirdjon grew up in a village not far from the town and absorbed all of the power from the nature and land that could be given to people living in a rural area. Because the village does not have large plants and factories, the air and water are not polluted with harmful substances. Sobirdjon loves his village. He is a very hardworking person. He also helps his elderly parents by raising livestock and earning a living with this business. He grows feed crops on a small plot of land. Sobirdjon needs a loan to purchase fertilizers and seeds for the sowing and preparation for the spring season. He hopes that he will be able to raise his family's financial status by obtaining the necessary amount from

","en":"Ismatillo is 47 years old. He has a specialized secondary education. Ismatillo works as a paramedic at the village ambulance. He provides medical aid to the village residents. He has two children. His oldest son attends a university and requires money to pay for the education.

Software Engineering. Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cA big family has big problems. We have seven in our family: my parents, my two older brothers, me and two siblings at school. My father and one of the older brothers are unemployed due to their health problems. My mother is the only breadwinner of our family. My second brother is a student at another local university. We have a lack of money all the time, always trying to save money and thinking about how to earn more. I try to help my family and work in summers, which is hardly enough to buy books and clothes for myself for the semester. We also have a field, and we grow vegetables and fruits, Part of it we eat, and the rest we sell at the markets.\r\n\r\nWe live in Issyk-Kul region in Kyrgyzstan. Last year I finished school and studied at the New Generation Academy of AUCA due to my full scholarship. It allowed me to study, live and eat for free, make me familiar with the American system of education and presented me with a lot of good friends and caring teachers. I met a new academic world where all students came from different parts of Kyrgyzstan with the same dream-to study and to enter AUCA. \r\n\r\nI know that AUCA is a special place, which can help me to defeat poverty in my family, be well-educated in order to achieve goals in the future, and be able to assist other needy people in my country. If I want to make the world better and establish peace in the world, I should start the improvements from myself. In this case I need a good education, which is possible just with the help of AUCA financial aid and a Kiva loan.\u201d

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

He is a married man with a three-year-old child who is not yet going to school. John has been farming for 18 years, and will use the loan from Kiva to buy fertilizers to use to grow maize to sell. The profits from the business will be used to pay his employees.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Imelda works as the town chiropractor and sees her patients in her house. Imelda and her husband have lived in the same home for over 15 years. They are very proud of what their hard work has given them. However, the tin roof they have gives them a lot of problems. The first one is the cold nights during winter and the lack of shelter the tin roof provides. The other reason is that Imelda thinks is it not the right environment to receive patients. They have been saving to replace the roof for a proper cement roof. They need the loan to finish buying the materials needed. Given the informality of Imelda's job and her age she has no access to credit from other institutions. They will receive technical training and supervision to make sure the construction meets all the quality and safety standards. Imelda wishes to finally have a place she can feel extremely proud of and where she can receive her patients.

is 32-years-old divorced woman from the city of Rustavi. She has a school-aged daughter and leads the family on her own. Khatuna works as a sales lady at the local store and generates 250 GEL monthly. As it becomes hard to earn a living with this insignificant income, Khatuna decided to start her own business and generate additional income. \r\n\r\nKhatuna requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program envisages provisions for business startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's poor people, who, regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, do not have access to credit products. With the received credit, Khatuna will purchase a stock of linens at wholesale prices in Turkey and will sell in her community with price mark-ups.\r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva startup loan, will significantly increase the family's income. Their income will double, and the family members will be able to improve their living conditions. Khatuna and her daughter rely on the goodwill of lenders and highly appreciate their help.

He is a farmer from a community not known for farming, but, nevertheless, he is earning a living through agriculture. He is happily married, and, together with his wife, they are blessed with a lovely family. \r\n\r\nFor the past 5 years, Benedict has been practicing mixed farming. And, because of his experience, Benedict both commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers and is regarded as a mentor. \r\n\r\nIncome from selling milk, eggs, and maize has allowed him to earn a decent income. Benedict passionately loves dairy farming, and he has named animals on his farm, such as Lelmet, his dairy cow. Milking and feeding Lelmet makes him very proud. By selling milk, he earns good returns, and the demand for milk has been expanding. Through extensive use of his mobile phone, he receives orders from customers and then sends his customers a text message when the milk is ready for collection. \r\n\r\nDemand has been overwhelming, and Benedict needs an additional cow to satisfy his orders. He is requesting a loan to buy a good quality dairy cow. Benedict does not intend to buy just an ordinary cow; he wants to buy a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce rich, creamy milk. The cow he plans to buy will produce between 15 to 20 liters of milk a day. \r\n\r\nThe increased milk production will translate into more income, and Benedict will be able to improve his living conditions and secure the future of his siblings going to school. In addition, Benedict hopes that if his milk selling business keeps growing at a good rhythm, he will be able to create at least one job on his farm for someone without job opportunities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1794315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-14T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-13T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.31,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benedict","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":42400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3000.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3088.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3178.73},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3271.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3367.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3465.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3671.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3778.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3888.89},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4002.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4119.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.98,"local_amount":3657.88,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3741.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262769},{"amount":37.73,"local_amount":3367.77,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3444.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264968},{"amount":93.3,"local_amount":8328.34,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":8518.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601143},{"amount":120.68,"local_amount":10898.46,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:10Z","rounded_local_amount":11147.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.41,"payment_id":681378018},{"amount":176,"local_amount":16147.55,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":16515.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.9,"payment_id":731022813}],"funded_date":"2015-02-13T17:36:46Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nathan Tichenor","image":28733}},{"id":822554,"name":"M\u00e1xima Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"M\u00e1xima, de 32 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 hasta noveno grado, la falta de apoyo econ\u00f3mico le obligo a no continuar su formaci\u00f3n acad\u00e9mica, es madre soltera y tiene un hijo, la relaci\u00f3n con su pareja no funciono y decidieron separarse, el ni\u00f1o va a k\u00ednder, ella lo lleva y lo trae a la escuela.- Actualmente, vive con su mam\u00e1 y hermanos, pero solo su hijo depende de ella. \n\nSe dedica al comercio de ropa usada, tiene un puesto en el mercado del pueblo, en el  cual solo vende los d\u00edas s\u00e1bados y domingos, ya que en esos d\u00edas es cuando m\u00e1s se logra vender,  ya tiene un a\u00f1o de dedicarse a este negocio, tener ingresos econ\u00f3micos para su hijo la llevo a tomar esta decisi\u00f3n.- Su mam\u00e1 le apoy\u00f3 en el inicio, comprando ella la mercader\u00eda y ella la vend\u00eda.\n\nLa distancia que recorre para llegar a donde tiene el puesto de trabajo es de 50 km, ya que es en otro departamento muy retirado de donde vive;

He wants to buy new instruments, but his financial condition does not allow him to buy them. <br \/><br \/>Due to his low purchasing power, Amtal requested a loan so that her husband can become empowered and can easily buy new instruments such as scissors, combs, a shaving machine, front mirror, and revolving chair.<br \/><br \/>Amtal hopes that this loan will work positively, and she would be able to make some savings for household expenses. Amtal thanks Kiva and field partner BRAC Pakistan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1794295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He is smallholder farmer based in Kericho, which is an agricultural center near the famous Rift valley. He owns a small piece of land, which he farms with his wife. They keep dairy cattle and grow maize, which they have been doing for 10 years. Their main income sources are milk and crops. To earn additional income, Peter recently ventured into a farm produce-motorcycle transportation business. \r\n\r\nPeter requested a loan for 30,000 KES, which he will use to expand his horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident from the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to provide Peter with access to a loan facility that will assist him to expand his horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. Peter\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":226.37,"image":{"id":1794372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to expand his horticulture farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-14T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-13T18:40:10Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.74,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.92,"local_amount":2564.36,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2728.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264970},{"amount":53.54,"local_amount":4589.25,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4883.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601145},{"amount":27.64,"local_amount":2399.08,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.35,"payment_id":681378020},{"amount":25.89,"local_amount":2262.99,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2408.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.51,"payment_id":696587685},{"amount":28.21,"local_amount":2539.42,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2702.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.42,"payment_id":711505998},{"amount":27.8,"local_amount":2451.34,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2608.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.8,"payment_id":731022815},{"amount":29.63,"local_amount":2596.18,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2762.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.66,"payment_id":752111000}],"funded_date":"2015-02-13T01:34:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":827787,"name":"King'atua Grazers Self Help Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In 2012 a group named Kingatua Grazers Self Help Group joined Hand in Hand Eastern Africa to be trained on savings management and financial management.\r\n\r\nBeth (shown raising her hand in the photograph) is one of the group members.

To support the needs of the family and to ensure that they are able to finance the education of their children, Angel helps her husband in managing their clothes store. \n\nBefore venturing in the clothes selling business, Angel and her husband previously owned and managed a shop that sold DVD tapes and mobile phone accessories. This business was not good for them, as the mark up on the goods are low and therefore giving them only a small amount of income. From their savings and the sales from the left-over stocks of DVD tapes and mobile phone accessories, Angel and her husband decided to invest in selling clothes. The business started off well and Angel was pleased to see that the income potential was also good.\n\nIn 2010, she joined SEED after being invited by a neighbor who is a group leader of SEED in the community. Consequently, she was able to avail a first loan of PhP 5,000 which she used to buy additional stocks for her clothing sales business focusing on ladies' wear such as blouses and dresses. With due diligence in repayment and savings, Angel was able to increase her credit line with SEED. To date, on her 8th loan cycle, Angel plans to buy additional stocks of jeans, dresses, and shirts. These items were highly demanded by her customers in time for the holiday season. Angel knew that her sales are going to be good in as much as people would rather buy from clothing stores such as hers in as much as she sells in bargain compared to malls and department stores.       \n\nAngel plans to finsih off the loan in just 18 months. By that time, it will be the season for school opening and she plans to invest in selling shoes and other footwear for school-aged children and teens. Angel expresses that she needs to plan ahead, study well the trends in her business, work hard and maintain her good credit and savings record for her to be able to operate her business with an increased return of income. With this, Angel is also assured that she and her husband will be able to continuously provide good education to their children and hopes that with it a better future for the whole family.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1763158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional stocks of dresses and shirts that are highly demanded by customers of her store during the holiday season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":389,"posted_date":"2014-12-30T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-13T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":5000.01,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595310095},{"amount":150,"local_amount":6666.68,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6708.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610700750},{"amount":150,"local_amount":6666.68,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":6708,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624384484},{"amount":150,"local_amount":6666.68,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:57:02Z","rounded_local_amount":6708,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636453867},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":4999.95,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5030.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649722681}],"funded_date":"2014-12-31T00:13:23Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T15:19:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":818844,"name":"Carmencita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In June 2014, Carmencita was able to acquire a PhP 15,000 loan from KIVA.

As she was able to stock ahead these items, Carmencita was able to maintain the price of her commodities even when other stores in the area have increased their prices. Consequently, Carmencita was able to not only retain but increase her customers and income.\n\nFor Carmencita, better sales is not the end all of the benefits of KIVA's loan extended to her. More importantly, the increased income has helped Carmencita to support the medical needs of her nephew who has a disability. To date, Carmencita is able to send her nephew in the country's biggest public hospital for therapy. Not only that, Carmencita was ablso able to support her brother who had medical needs after suffering from stroke.\n\nOn her third loan now, Carmencita is availing a PhP 17,000 loan. This time she wants to buy canned goods, toiletry items such as bath and laundry soap and soda drinks which are also highly demanded in her store. Having these items in her store would prop her income by 2 - 3% more of what she is earning today. \n\nCarmencita works hard to support her family who needs her most for their medical needs.

studying. \n\nAs Angustia's husband is earning only a meager amount which hardly suffice their daily needs, Angustia decided to put up her own business of selling bottled water. Starting up with only 10 gallons of water sold per week, Angustia patiently dealt with the business and learned the trade. At first, the income coming from the business helped Angustia to support the transportation expenses of her children going to and from the school. However, realizing that she can earn more if she can invest in other businesses, Angustia began looking for other sources of funds to invest for her planned business of a general store.\n\nIt was at this time, in 2010, that Angustia came across SEED through one of its employees conducting promotion activities in the area. Angustia completed the necessary orientation seminars and finally availed a PhP 4,000 loan at the start. With the funds now, Angustia was able to set up a general store in her house. Again, Angustia tried to learn the trade noting on competition and credit concerns among customers and with due diligence was able to repay back her loan. Angustia availed reloans thereafter which steadily increased the volume of her stocks. \n\nHowever, after a particular visit from an employee of SEED, Angustia realized that there are more potentials in terms of income should she invest in food production. The employee took time to coach her on the how much she could earn should she pursue her plan of producing food items. She listened and put into action what she learned. With this knowledge, Angustia began to study the production of dumplings and burger patties. On her 4th loan, Angustia funded this business and was more than happy with the income she earned. To date, Angustia earns a net of PhP 5,000 per day from her combined businesses of general store and food production. Not only that, Angustia was able to give employment to two neighbors. One was helping her with the actual food production while the other one was helping her as a sales staff in her business. \n\nOpening a branch in front of a public national high school where she lives, the demand for Angustia's products became higher. Students would often flock her stall buying food for snacks or lunch. It is in this context that Angustia needed to buy additional food steamers to process her dumplings and burger patties and a freezer to keep her stocks. These will be what Angustia is planning to buy on her 6th loan now amounting to PhP 30,000. \n\nIn the future, Angustia plans to open a business with which she can partner with and optimize her husband's skills in auto painting. For now, Angustia is intent to improve her current business, earn well and support her family's needs while also giving some employment opportunity in her community. Indeed, as Mark Twain once said and as Angustia's business history embodies, \"The success of getting ahead is getting started.\"

To help her husband, Marites worked before as a laundrywoman in their neighborhood. Earning from doing laundry, Marites made it a point to save a small portion of her savings. In 2012, with her savings, Marites ventured into business and sold poultry products. It was at the same time that she was invited by one of her customers to join SEED. Not knowing that there was this opportunity to avail a loan for micro-entrepreneurs such as her, Marites attended the orientation seminars and was accorded a first loan of PhP 8,000 eventually. The amount of her first loan was used by Marites to set up a general store that sells canned goods, cooking oil, and poultry products such as eggs and dressed chicken. \n\nWith succeeding loan, Marites was able to buy 2 cavans of rice which she rolls out in a month. Seeing that rice vending gives her lucrative income, Marites on her 6th loan cycle now wants to avail a PhP 30,000 loan to buy an additional 10 cavans of rice and sacks of white and washed sugar for her to sell in general store. Marites says that aside from individual customers, she can also supply other small stores within her community of these items and in turn earn more. \n\nWith business doing good and the extension of loan to her by SEED, Marites claims she was able to avail a house under a rent-to-own scheme. With this, Marites and her family is assured of security in housing. Marites dreams also of having her four other children finish their education.

She has been separated from her husband since her child was still small. Sadly, too, her only child who\u2019s barely 18 years old passed away due to kidney failure. \n\nBefore, Teresita used to be employed as a factory worker. However, in 2003 she was forced by her mother to resign from her job in order for her to attend to her ill child personally. Her mother gave her PhP 5,000 for start-up capital to open a general store. With this Teresita was able to earn while being hands-on in the care of her child. In 2013, Teresita was invited by a neighbor who happens to be SEED's group leader in the area. From then, Teresita was able to avail a first loan in SEED and used it up to increase her stocks of canned goods. Because of the additional income, Teresita was able to support the medical needs of her child which was then still sick. However, with her child's health failing, Teresita is now left alone to tend to her own needs.\n\nDuring her child's death, Teresita says she felt that she no longer needs to do business. However, she says that life should continue to go on. For one, she is no longer getting young and needs to prepare for the time that she will need to support her retirement. Also, she wanted to give support to her mother who has been her closest ally during the time that she was struggling with her child's ailment. Thus, Teresita saw it fit to continue running her store. \n\nOn her 9th loan now, Teresita plans to buy cooking oil, rice, sugar and coffee in volumes. In turn, she will have this commodities repacked and sold in retail in her store. Repacking makes it more affordable for her customers to buy those items which they normally could not buy in volumes in the market or on grocery stores.  \n\nTeresita says she is thankful that there are institutions like SEED who support small entrepreneurs like her. She says that with the loan being provided to her she was able to increase her savings.

She availed a loan and utilized it to  to put up a burger and snack stand for additional income of the family. Later on, as she feels her continuous success in her business, she thought of adding again items to sell in her store.

For her peanut butter business, she does her marketing once a month to procure peanuts and the bottle containers to be used in the packaging of the finished products. With due diligence, Myrna was able to improve her business. She was able to invest in equipments such as stoves, gas ranges and a display shelf. She was also able to open another branch of her burger and snack stand and due to this was also able to provide employment to a neighbor who works for her as a store helper. \n\nNow Myrna is on her 11th cycle and wanted to avail a loan of PhP 30,000. Of which, she wanted to buy at least 50 kilos more of peanuts, cooking oil and sugar. These are necessary to increase her production of peanut butter. Aside from selling these in her snack stand, orders are also pouring in as much as some of her neighbors are beginning to market her peanut butter in exchange of commission sales. \n\nIn the future, Myrna wants to add up another burger and snack stand. Myrna says she needs to work harder and earn more specially now that her daughter is on her junior year in college.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1763385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy at least 50 kilos of peanuts, cooking oil and sugar to produce more peanut butter covering increased orders.

On top of these, she was also able to procure bottled water in volumes which are highly demanded in her store. Annalita made it a point to repay her loan and knows that with a good credit standing, she have better chances of improving her business.\n\nOn her 5th loan cycle now, Annalita set up a new business venture selling out home-cooked viands. Sales from the new business increased with time. Annalita maintains that viand-selling is a hit owing to the location of her business which is situated in the commercial and industrial of the municipality.  With the initial capital invested in this business, Annalita was able to improve her income by 20% more. Likewise, Annalita is able to provide employment to four neighbors who work as helpers and cook in her businesses. With a new loan of PhP 80,000 Annalita will be able to buy pork, beef and chicken meat, fish and vegetables in volume to sustain and expand her eatery business. \n\nAnnalita says that loan extended to her as a small micro-entrepreneur helps a lot specially that these loans have low interest and have no collateral. This is something that Annalita keeps in mind as she pursues payment of her loan on time. She is fully aware that as her business continues to grow, her financial situation also improves.

52 years old, Winnie still works hard to support her family. Widowed and with 6 children, she sustains her family through her retail store which has been running since 2002. \n\nShe became a member of SEED in 2011 and availed a first loan of PhP 5,000 which she used as additional capital to her store. With subsequent loans, Winnie was also able to set up a small burger stand in front of her house. The increased income enabled Winnie to buy more value added items for her store to include refilled tanks of liquefied petroleum gas. \n\nOn her 8th loan now and with good repayment record on each previous loan cycles, Winnie plans to avail a PhP 25,000 loan. This time, she plans to invest on buying at least 5 more sacks of rice, bottled water and infant formula milk. These commodities are highly demanded in the community where she lives.

During the same year, Norhata encountered SEED through another Muslim neighbor who also benefits from SEED's programs and services. Norhata was happy to find an institution that not only provides capital for business to Muslims like her (where there are only a few microfinance institutions working with Muslims in the city where she lives) but more importantly provides important services to include business and social development training. Seeing the benefits, Norhata completed the membership process and availed a loan of PhP 10,000. The money she acquired was invested by Norhata on buying additional mobile phone accessories. With diligence and good repayment record, Norhata was able to avail reloans which she have used in the past to add more items to her shop including portable stereos and speakers. Also, Norhata was able to provide employment to one neighbor who assists her in manning her mobile phone accessories shop. \n\nOn her 5th loan cycle now, Norhata is planning to avail a PhP 25,000 loan to invest in equipments which will enable the repairs of mobile phones and other electronic gadgets such as tablets. Norhata claims that with this service, her business will be a one-stop shop for all those looking for affordable electronic items and repairs of the same. With this, she will also be able to employ another neighbor to do the repairs.

Even though it rains a lot in Borneo and most of the island is covered by ever green plantations and rainforests, it is hard to get drinking water. That is why he started looking for a filter. As he says:\n\n\u201c I started selling in 2010, I was looking for a water filter that makes water ready to drink, and that is of course, is cheap and easy to use. I browsed internet, that is how I started to know Nazava Water Filters.  I ordered one filter from another reseller and started selling them. \nAt first we were hesitant to consume water that has been filtered by a Nazava Water filter but to eliminate any doubt, we tested water that was filtered Nazava. We were really surprised and amazed after knowing the results of the lab that showed that the water was clean and germ free. I have been using Nazava Water Filters for 4 years now.\u201d\n\nNazava Water Filters costs less than 20 USD and provide and enable families to filter their well tap and rain water so it becomes safe to drink. Shipping water filters to Kalimantan is expensive, especially when you ship in small amounts. Mr Tahal wants to use the loan to ship 150 filter in one time which means he can significantly save on shipping costs.

is 36 years old and has been solely rearing her two children, aged 14 and 9, after she was separated from her husband. To make ends meet, Remy opened a small general store in their house and this has been the source of her family's income until now. \n\nAfter attending the orientation seminar of SEED, Remy availed a first loan amounting to PhP 6,000 which she used as additional capital for her store. As her business began earning well, and with the infusion of the loan, Remy added up other businesses to include a burger stand. Likewise, Remy made it a point that at the end of the day with each earning she makes, she is able to set up an amount to prepare her weekly payment for her loan and put also a portion to her savings. \n\nOn her 12th loan cycle now, Remy wants to avail PhP 30,000 which she intends to buy toys, slippers, and frozen meat products for her store. Remy notes that these items are highly demanded with the holiday season. Remy recounts that as early as October she had been receiving orders from her neighbors on those items which they intend to buy for themselves, their children or be made as gifts. Remy saw this as an opportunity to increase her income further.\n\nWith hard work, and alone at that matter, Remy was able to sustain the needs of her family. Not only that, she was also able to buy a television set and an electric fan which made her children enjoy more convenience. In the future, Remy wants to go strong with the selling of frozen meat products and wants to avail a freezer for that.

Her husband, works as a councilor in the Barangay (the smallest political and governing unit in the country) and earns only a monthly allowance which could hardly suffice for their needs if they will only rely on this.\n\nPrior to this, Rosie and her husband worked in a factory. In 2004, Rosie and her husband decided to resign and manage their own business. With the separation pay that they had after the resignation, Rosie opened a small \"sari-sari\" (general) store within their house premises. Rosie found it good that she and her husband is able to earn from the business and at the same time personally look after their children at home. \n\nHowever, with the growing needs of their family, Rosie's husband thought of going on fishing as their residence is located within the sea-strip of Cavite. It was at this time in 2012 that Rosie encountered SEED which at that time was performing an outreach program in their community in time for Christmas. In the beginning of 2013, Rosie looked for SEED's office and inquired on how to become a member. From there, Rosie was able to avail a first loan of PhP 10,000 which she used to buy a second hand motor for a fishing boat that she and her husband has earlier acquired. \n\nThe boat became operational and Rosie's husband was able to augment their income with fishing. With increased income, Rosie was able to roll out her capital further on her sari-sari store which enabled her to buy prime commodities such as rice. The sari-sari store also served as income buffer when Rosie's husband could not go out on the seas to fish specially, when there is a typhoon.  On the other hand, the fishing business of her husband also went well. To date they are able to provide income to 8 neighbors who help them in fishing wherein 2 are net maintenance weavers and 6 fishermen. \n\nHowever, the second hand motor they have bought is already failing. As such, on her 5th loan now, Rosie wants to buy a new motor for their fishing boat. To be able to buy this, Rosie would need at least PhP 30,000.

Cliff has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. Because of the hardcore poverty in his village, Cliff started practicing mixed farming and has been doing it for the past 10 years. Cliff's sources of income are vegetables, milk, tea and egg selling; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, and one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. \r\n\r\nThe Nyamira area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Cliff is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. \r\n\r\nCliff is very determined to succeed and because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans that through accumulated profits, he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and also for his grandchildren to come. Cliff's dream is to provide a secure future for his siblings through paying tuition fees for them.

The dairy business is an important source of income to small-scale farmers in Kenya. Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva to provide financial and technical solutions to poor farmers such as Julius, a father of four children in the Molo area of Kenya. Julius has been a mixed farmer for the past six years, and his primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and food crops.He also has a side business (motorcycle business).\r\n\r\n The Molo area has a cool climate, but sometimes experiences long dry spells, and this accounts for major crop failures which can lead to starvation. Julius is seeking a loan to purchase a high quality dairy cow. Easy availability of feed and fodder all year round makes dairy farming an ideal choice of investment in this region. Through the loan, Julius will be able to fully satisfy the demand for milk in his village and through increased income; he will be able to improve his living conditions. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be very important because it will not only improve Julius\u2019s life, but also, he will be able to get manure, which will be used on his farm and improve productivity. Through Juhudi Kilimo, Julius has been trained on how to save money, and he plans to use the extra income to expand his business and is planning to buy another dairy cow.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

All group members were born and live in the Chozvo area. The group sell their crop at a fair price to Empresa de Comercializa\u00e7\u00e3o Agricola Lda (ECA), a local agribusiness which both acts as a buyer and provides the farmers with quality farming inputs and technical advice. An investment by AgDevCo has allowed ECA to purchase a state-of-the-art maize mill, designed for use in rural areas, so it can process the farmers\u2019 crop before selling it on. The group in total farm 15 hectares of land. All farming is done manually. The farmers require finance to purchase vital farming inputs- all of them purchase seed and some choose to purchase fertiliser in addition. Access to a group loan of 28,210 Meticais (854 USD) equates to an average of 1,881 Meticais (58 USD) per participant- enough for the farmers to purchase from ECA the inputs they vitally need. Farming conditions in the area are extremely tough with only intermittent rainfall. However, since becoming participants on the Chozvo outgrower scheme all the farmers report life becoming easier. They can afford good quality fertiliser, which is purchased from ECA. The farmers\u2019 crops are also bought by ECA every week- they come to their farms so the participants do not need to walk long distances to find a market for their crops. Since ECA\u2019s arrival into their community, and with access to funds to purchase the necessary inputs, the farmers have seen their yields and incomes increasing threefold. This is allowing them to invest in their farms, buy motorbikes and send their children to school.

He has been married for 5 years. Stanley keeps three dairy cows and 20 head of poultry; has over 30 trees; and grows millet, sorghum, and a variety of other crops. At this point in his life, he is forced to work tirelessly to meet the family's growing needs. For example, his highest annual expense on his children's education alone is over USD $1,000.\r\n\r\nTo keep providing adequately for his family, he decided to think outside the box and came up with a good business plan with a favorable return on investment. He is seeking a loan of KES 60,000 to start an agrovet business. His vision is for the business to be a leading enterprise in its category in the Kericho area, offering farm inputs and animal feeds at affordable prices. He is anticipating many customers, as there is little competition in the area. He has already invested some of his own savings to get the business started. He plans to use your loan investment to purchase more items to stock the agrovet.

Her primary income sources are eggs, milk, and some personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. Generating an income through selling her harvest is the part of farming she enjoys most. Availability of labor is a major challenge for Victoria. She also keeps a dairy cow. Before joining Juhudi, Victoria could not access loans from banks since they considered her a high-risk client. She mobilized marginalized farmers and created the self-help group Gatei Pamoja. Through the group, she joined Juhudi Kilimo and learned about loan management and agribusiness. She also learned about Kiva. Victoria is seeking a loan for constructing a cow shed and to purchase farm implements. With your help, Victoria will introduce zero grazing (an environmentally sound method of cattle care) and purchase more effective modern tools that will make her farm activities much easier.

Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and other personal businesses she engages in to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nFrom her experience, dairy farming is not only profitable, but also enjoyable: all the animals on her farm are referred to by names. She has nicknamed her cows. The challenge, however, is that growth is constrained by limited funds\/capital. \r\n\r\nChristine is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. She has been keeping poultry for fun for many years. Recently, however, she was taught how poultry is a big business, if made commercial. She feared the high costs involved in setting up a commercial poultry farm at first, but after looking at the projections, she sees the point. \r\n\r\nInvest in Christine\u2019s future.

On the farm, she keeps 2 cows, 10 head of poultry and other animals such as sheep and goats. She has also grown crops such as bananas for food and trade. \r\n\r\nShe's very conscious of the environment, and as a result she has grown approximately 30 trees on the small farm. \r\n\r\nNkio is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to grow more bananas on her farm. Growing bananas can be very costly due to the labor required.

Don Wilson is the research coordinator at URACCAN (University of the Autonomous Regions of the Nicaraguan Caribbean Coast) in the town of Nueva Guinea.  <br \/><br \/>He has his own home, which was built with the help of loans.  Wilson is grateful to God that he is not lacking in work.  The loans have made it possible for him to have a nice house, but there are a few things that need to be completed at a later time.  His main priority right now is to buy quarry stones, cement, iron, a toilet, pipes, and to pay for labor so that a bathroom and sewage system can be installed in his home.  This is why he is requesting a Kiva loan.  Even with his family\u2019s combined income, the expenses are still too high for him to make this investment in his home.  It would be impossible for Don Wilson to take on this project with his income, so he needs a loan in order to fulfill his dream of providing better sanitation and privacy in his home.  <br \/><br \/>Not only has Wilson invested Kiva loans into his home, but he also used them for his professional studies.

He has dreamed since childhood of getting a good education and now his dream is coming to fruition. He lives with three generations of his large, loving family, including two brothers and his elderly grandmother and grandfather, who help out by caring for the youngest grandchildren.

He earns a living moving stones and rubble with his own tractor, a business he began right after finishing his high school education. At first he transported stones with a truck, and then he got a tractor. He now has regular customers and a monthly income of about 25,000 KGS, which can be higher in a good season. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Saparali's tractor has broken down, and so he has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 150,000 KGS to buy parts so he can repair his tractor, which is the only means of earning an income for his family. He plans to put profits from the loan toward buying a bigger tractor, which will help his family's standard of living in the

He is the father of a 2-year-old daughter and makes a living commercializing balloons. His business idea arose when he was working in changing balloons for scrap or recycled material which he then sold. But he considered that it would be more profitable to offer the balloons to local stores. He launched his idea and it was viable. Since then, his main customers are the shops and corner stores who make payments in cash, and he also offers them ease of payment. Cristobal currently has 10 years of experience in this activity and he works Monday to Sunday, 7AM to 5PM. He is very committed to his work because he wants to give his son an excellent level of well-being. He wants to expand his business to other parts of the city. Since his working capital is insufficient he is applying for his first Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

With the loan from Kiva, he would like to buy fertilizers grow beans and maize. The profits from his harvest will be used to renovate his house.\n\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

En sus negocios todo marcha sobre ruedas y el \u00fanico reto que enfrentan es la competencia, pero ellos siempre procuran ofrecer los mejores precios, calidad y sobre todo un buen trato. \n\nUna de las grandes metas de la pareja es poder ver realizadas profesionalmente a sus hijas, para ellos, el hecho de que sus hijas logren titularse podr\u00e1n tener m\u00e1s oportunidades de trabajo. Tambi\u00e9n quisieran hacer mejoras a su vivienda porque la han descuidado mucho ya que por el momento gran parte de sus ganancias las destinan a la educaci\u00f3n de sus ni\u00f1as. \n\nEsta vez, con su pr\u00e9stamo Do\u00f1a Sol invetir\u00e1 en sus zapatos, Do\u00f1a Teresa en sus borreguitos y Don Javier en sus frituras y Botanas.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en un peque\u00f1o parque en el municipio donde habitan los integrantes. Sol viste un su\u00e9ter verde.","en":"The \u201cEl Tibur\u00f3n\u201d (\u201cThe Shark\u201d) group consists of three members who are bound by family ties; Teresa and Sovelva are mother and daughter, and Javier is the husband of Sovelva. They live in a very simple and peaceful Mazahua community which is rich in traditions and culture.\r\n\r\nSol, as she is affectionately called in her community, is 43 years old and has been living with Javier for 24 years. They are the parents of two women, one of which is studying towards a degree in accounting. \r\n\r\nJavier began his life as a trader selling fried food and snacks. \u201cIt was due to necessity, to the lack of fixed employment\u201d, he commented. A while ago the couple was living in Mexico City and the opportunity to buy second-hand shoes at a reasonable price presented itself to them. So they invested the capital that they had and returned to their community with a great quantity of shoes, which they began to sell at the street markets. \u201cThe first time we were very embarrassed, but it went really well for us so we were motivated to continue with the business\u201d.\r\n\r\nCurrently Sol is in charge of selling shoes and Javier is in charge of selling fried food and snacks; they both work six days a week and only rest on Saturdays, which they make the most of for doing other activities since the two businesses absorb all their time during the week.\r\n\r\nSol and Javier have been with VisionFund ever since six years ago when they decided to request their first loan. VisionFund\u2019s support has enabled them to continue buying their merchandise. They are very happy with, and grateful to, the institution since with their effort and the capital they have managed to have greater stability and to buy two trucks for transporting their products easily from one place to another. In their businesses, everything goes like clockwork and the only challenge they face is the competition, but they always try to offer the best prices, quality, and, above all, good service.\r\n\r\nOne of the couple\u2019s big goals is to be able to see their daughters become professionals. To them, the fact that their daughters will manage to get degrees would secure more work opportunities for them. They would also like to make improvements to their home because they have neglected it a lot since at the moment most of their profits go towards their girls\u2019 education.\r\n\r\nThis time Sol will invest the loan in her shoes, Teresa will invest it in her sheepskin linings, and Javier will invest it his fried food and snacks.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in a small park in the municipality where the members live. Sol is wearing a green sweater.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3400,"image":{"id":1772374,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more second-hand shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"La Virgen, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-30T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-13T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":3400,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sovelva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Javier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5745.36},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5882.77},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":6023.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6167.52},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6466.06},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":6620.71},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6779.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":390.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400.03},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":409.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":419.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":429.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":439.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450.21},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":790.76,"local_amount":11628.75,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":11691.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980702},{"amount":829.03,"local_amount":12191.65,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":12256.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423854},{"amount":869.16,"local_amount":12781.78,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":12850.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769185},{"amount":911.05,"local_amount":13397.82,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":13469.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649763945}],"funded_date":"2015-01-01T20:43:57Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eloise Minogue","image":null}},{"id":822535,"name":"Mohammed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammed is a married mother of three children who are under her care and all attend school.

Algunas conocidas me recomendaron vender ropa porque seg\u00fan se obten\u00edan buenas ganancias\u201d y as\u00ed comenz\u00f3 la actividad. Todos los d\u00edas Isabel sale a vender ofreciendo la mercanc\u00eda casa por casa y en otros lugares de la comunidad, adem\u00e1s ofrece a sus clientes facilidades de pago para que ellos tengan mayor oportunidad de adquirir la ropa, en ocasiones tambi\u00e9n le hacen encargos especiales. \n\nDo\u00f1a Isabel est\u00e1 muy agradecida con VisionFund y KIVA por los pr\u00e9stamos otorgados hasta ahora porque han sido de gran ayuda ya que el mayor reto es la falta de capital para comprar m\u00e1s prendas. Cada que recibe su cr\u00e9dito, lo aprovecha al m\u00e1ximo buscando los mejores precios y ofertas lo que le ha facilitado conservar su negocio y con las ganancias logr\u00f3 ofrecer lo m\u00e1s necesario a sus hijos.

On a cold afternoon, it's a great idea to make and share a glass of traditional punch with loved ones. It is made with tejocote [type of fruit], guava, tamarind, cane sugar, apple, cinnamon, and powdered brown sugar. The flavor is even better if it is served in a clay pitcher.\r\n\r\nIsabel is the representative of the group. She is a hard-working woman, who is quick to smile but a little reserved. She is 39 years old and married to Riberino, who works as a public servant. The couple has three children, although now only one depends on them. He is in high school.\r\n\r\nFor 5 years now, Isabel has sold clothing for a living. She mentions that she started her business because at that time, her children were in high school, college, and junior high. Her husband's job was unstable and costs kept going up. \"I needed to help cover the household costs and my children's education. Some people I know suggested that I sell clothing because they said I could make good money,\" and that is how she started the business.\r\n\r\nEvery day, Isabel heads out to sell merchandise from house to house, and in other areas of the community. She also offers payment plans to her customers so that they are better able to get clothing. Sometimes they request special orders.\r\n\r\nIsabel is very thankful to VisionFund and Kiva for the loans they offer because they have been a great help, as her biggest challenge is a lack of capital to buy more clothing. Every time she receives a loan, she gets the most out of it that she can, looking for the best prices and sales. This has allowed her to maintain her business, and with her earnings, she has been able to give her children what they need most. For now, she is not thinking of stopping her work - not until her youngest son becomes a professional. Smiling, Isabel remarks, \"In the future, I would love to have a permanent location where I could sell clothing.\"\r\n\r\nThe other group members are also very happy and thankful to VisionFund and Kiva because they will be able to invest in their business.

One child attends school. He has farmed for 5 years and will use the loan from Kiva, to buy fertilizer. The profits from the business will be used to pay his workers.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Nevertheless Vladimar, upon finishing his studies, began working on the La Cumbre project where he decided to specialize in arc welding, in order to be a qualified welder and receive the associated income that will enable him to support his mother and three siblings. Vladimir is thankful to the people who through their economic resources will permit him to continue studying and help him accomplish his dreams of being successful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1771709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She works Monday to Sunday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Her sales are made for cash, likewise she pays for her purchases, which she makes at warehouses, in cash.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a Kiva loan, her first loan, through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With this loan, she will buy supplies like flour, oil, eggs, and other ingredients for the preparation of her products. Her production will benefit from this investment and so will her sales, because at this time of the year, her sales increase because of the Christmas festivities. \r\n\r\nEilenn is a woman with clear goals for her future: she wants to have her own house, and to expand her commercial activities.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":344.23,"image":{"id":1759914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Juanita works selling haberdashery and stationary products.  Her business was born out of her own necessity.  The distance from her home to the local stationary store was very far, and there were times when one of her children forgot some material for their homework late at night and it was too difficult to go get it.  Motivated to remedy this inconvenience that others in the community also suffered with, she started a small stationary store that also included haberdashery and gifts.  She was able to use a space in her home and with her earnings, she invested in purchasing more merchandise to expand her offerings to her customers.  She currently also sells beverages and ice in the same store.\r\n\r\nJuanita is in need of a loan to purchase elastic, thread, buttons, zippers, gift wrap, ribbons, pens, pencils, notebooks, acrylic paints and other commonly purchased products.  Her husband and children's unconditional support have been essential in the continuity of her business.
