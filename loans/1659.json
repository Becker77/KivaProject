She likes that the interest is low and there are few steps to access credit.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1794085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2015-01-14T22:40:27Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-13T22:40:27Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shirley Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1395.64,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":139.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":139.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":139.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":139.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":139.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":139.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":139.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":139.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":139.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.99},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.99},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.99},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.99},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":280,"local_amount":279.12,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:45:25Z","rounded_local_amount":280,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611785765},{"amount":280,"local_amount":279.12,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:29:30Z","rounded_local_amount":280,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624232412},{"amount":279.99,"local_amount":279.12,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":279.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636218155},{"amount":279.98,"local_amount":279.12,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":279.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649569801},{"amount":280.03,"local_amount":279.16,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:19:56Z","rounded_local_amount":280.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665050395}],"funded_date":"2015-01-14T23:09:43Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:19:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lara Roy","image":1665294}},{"id":817685,"name":"Irma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Irma payed her first loan on time and now is asking for a second loan that she will use to expand the space of her business and accommodate the machine that she acquired.

The majority of the roads are surrounded by hills and a lot of vegetation, especially sugar cane plantations. A group called Ebennecer was formed here; the name, of Hebrew origin, means \"helping stone.\"\n\nVisionFund helps the members continue with their jobs by granting them loans. The members and their businesses are Claudia, cosmetics sales; Celia, nutritional supplements sales; Eluteria, pig sales; Cidronia, cargo transportation driver; and Ernestina, clothing sales.\n\nEluteria, 76, is a great woman. Her native language is Mazatec and she also speaks Spanish.  She wasn't able to go to school and, since she lost her husband 20 years ago, she has been father and mother to her children, who currently help her financially. She lives with a grandson, 23, and a great-granddaughter, 10, who still attends school.\n\nEluteria likes to raise animals. She has about 25 hens, 3 roosters, a parrot, and some pigs, which she decided to start raising for sale three years ago. With her earnings and her previous loans, she buys little pigs, which she sells when they weigh about 80 or 90 kilos. She also buys feed. She covers her personal expenses and has some savings, because twice a year she visits her children who live in other cities.\n\nAt the moment Eluteria has three pigs. They're already under contract for sale, so she has requested another loan to buy three pigs older than a month old to raise. \"With the earnings from the sale of my three pigs I'm going to buy a female pig to raise. The good thing is that the plot of land is big\". That way her profits will be a little higher. Eluteria said her grandson helps her wash the pigsty because they have to draw water from the well.\n\nThe group is grateful for the new opportunity they're going to take advantage of in their jobs and making their payments.\n\n*In the photo Eluteria's wearing an apron, which she says she takes off only to sleep.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1760080,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy three one-month-old pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Localidad El Zapote, Municipio Acatlan Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-01-14T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-13T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eluteria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cidronia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ernestina Suzette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":308.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.34},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":308.34,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4520.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980688},{"amount":308.34,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4520.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423840},{"amount":308.33,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4520.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769171},{"amount":232.26,"local_amount":3389.78,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3405.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649763932},{"amount":308.67,"local_amount":4504.87,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4525.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597479},{"amount":384.06,"local_amount":5605.35,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5631.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682140889}],"funded_date":"2015-01-17T15:27:17Z","paid_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":820058,"name":"Maranura Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal MARANURA, el banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Maranura, provincia de La Convenci\u00f3n y departamento de Cusco.\nLa socia Frida tiene 49 a\u00f1os de edad tiene 05 hijos y es casada, la socia alterna sus actividades diarias dedic\u00e1ndose al negocio de tienda de abarrotes, la socia lleva buen tiempo dedic\u00e1ndose a su negocio el cual le va bien gracias al empe\u00f1o que le pone cada d\u00eda a su negocio, la socia desea poder seguir trabajando para de esta forma seguir apoyando a su familia, la socia vende arroz,az\u00facar,leche ,gaseosas entre otros para todos sus clientes que le solicitan, siendo de esta manera que la socia saca adelante a su familia.\nLa socia solicita el cr\u00e9dito para la compra de leche, az\u00facar entre otros.\nLa socia se siente agradecida por el cr\u00e9dito otorgado y se compromete a cumplir con sus cuotas establecidas.\nLos dem\u00e1s socios se dedican a la agricultura, crianza de animales, venta de cereales.\n","en":"This is the Maranura communal bank, located in the Maranura district, La Convenci\u00f3n province, Cusco department.\n\nFrida, age 49, is married and has five children.

She loves farm animals for the social and economic benefits they provide. Currently, she has two cows and five heads of poultry on her one-acre farm. She also owns a motorbike that she uses for transporting farm goods and passengers over short distances. One of the major challenges that Joanina faces is lack of adequate feed for her cows. This challenge usually results in poor health for her animals and lowered milk production. In severe cases, it may lead to death of the animal due to illnesses caused by malnutrition. She is seeking a loan to secure adequate feed for her farm animals.

Her loan request was approved within the framework of a joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provisions business start-ups and restart-up credits with easy terms for the country's rural poor, who are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, and lack of access to credit products. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she will start selling clothes, and her husband will help her. They will buy clothes from Tbilisi at wholesale prices, and sell them in nearby towns for a markup.

Desde peque\u00f1a, Do\u00f1a Matilde observaba a su abuela y a su mam\u00e1 elaborando servilletas bordadas para envolver las tortillas y conservarlas calientes. Recuerda que solo las elaboraban para uso propio y a Do\u00f1a Matilde se le ocurri\u00f3 que ser\u00eda una muy buena opci\u00f3n ofrecerlas a las amas de casa que simplemente no tienen tiempo para elaborarlas. Su trabajo ha sido reconocido en su comunidad por la calidad y la puntualidad de las entregas cuando le hacen pedidos grandes para celebraciones y fiestas. Hace algunos d\u00edas entreg\u00f3 recuerdos para una boda y las ganancias las utiliz\u00f3 para comprar m\u00e1s comida para su familia. \n\nMatilde ocupa sus tardes para bordar una vez que ha terminado sus actividades del hogar. A pesar de que este es el segundo ciclo en que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo a VisionFund, est\u00e1 agradecida porque podr\u00e1 comprar tela, aros, agujas, hilos y estambres de varios colores para continuar realizando lo que tanto ama.

They even talk to each other in their mother tongue, a situation that does not happen in other neighbouring communities.\r\n\r\nMatilde is the group's representative. She is 41 years old and is married to Hermenegildo, who makes a living working in the fields. Together, they have formed a family with five children, only one of whom is their dependant and goes to elementary school.\r\n\r\nEight years ago, Matilde began making embroidered handicrafts such as napkins, tablecloths, and the like. \"My children were very young; my husband used to work in the fields alone, and his pay was too low, so I decided to help out with what I do best, and which I also love,\" [she says.]\r\n\r\nFrom a very young age, Matilde used to watch her grandmother and her mother make embroidered napkins to wrap tortillas to keep them warm. She remembers that they only used to make them for their personal use, and Matilde came up with the idea that it would be a very good option to offer them to the homemakers who were too busy to make them. \r\n\r\nShe has been recognized in her community for the quality of her work and the punctuality with which she delivers large orders for celebrations and parties. A few days ago, she delivered some wedding souvenirs, and she used the profits to buy more food for her family.\r\n\r\nMatilde spends her evenings embroidering once she has finished her household chores. Even though this is the second time that she is requesting a loan from VisionFund, she is grateful because she will be able to buy fabric, embroidery hoops, needles, thread, and yarn in an assortment of colours to keep on doing what she so much loves to do. In addition, she says that the previous loan allowed her to invest in the purchase of animals such as chickens and turkeys, which she is about to sell, and, in this way, she will have a little extra money for her family.\r\n\r\nMatilde has a new plan in mind. She would like to improve the coop she has in order to start selling the eggs that her hens may lay. However, her greatest dream is to continue increasing her sales to be able to make improvements to her home.\r\n\r\nLike Matilde, the other group members are very happy and grateful for the loan because they will be able to invest it in their businesses. Eleuteria, Felipa, and Mariana will invest in napkins while Silvia and Sof\u00eda will invest in chickens.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken on the stairs of the municipal bandstand. Behind the group members, part of the Catholic church can be seen. Matilde is the one sitting right in the middle of the group*\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":1772419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy fine-checked fabric, thread, needles, and the like.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Mavati, San Felipe del Progresi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-31T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-14T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":3125,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eleuteria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Matilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":46000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.32},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.32},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.32},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.32},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1171.88,"local_amount":17250,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":17325.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980705},{"amount":781.25,"local_amount":11500,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":11550.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423857},{"amount":976.56,"local_amount":14375,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":14438.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769188},{"amount":195.31,"local_amount":2875,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2887.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649763947}],"funded_date":"2014-12-31T13:18:04Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Flores","image":null}},{"id":827984,"name":"Los Urpichas De Huancaro Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cLOS URPICHAS DE HUANCARO\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

She is a 42-year-old smallholder farmer based in Kerugoya, which is a small rural town in Central Kenya. Jane and her husband have been blessed with two children. For 10 years Jane has been a mixed farmer. She keeps dairy cattle and poultry on her farm. She also grows maize, among other crops. Despite prevailing animal diseases, she finds dairy farming to be the most enjoyable commercial farming activity. Besides dairy farming, she has a deep connection with gardening. In African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive, hobby for women. You really don't have to be born with a green thumb to give life to a glorious garden; any woman with a homestead and a few square feet of earth is doing her best to make her little corner of the world more gracious and beautiful. Jane, however, is taking this a little step further \r\n\r\nJane is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming. This is a big deal for her.

a young man with a positive attitude.  He is married and the father of one child.  He truly loves his family with whom he lives in a small village.  In spite of his young age, Jasur works very hard to provide for his loved ones.  He works in agriculture.  As an additional source of income, he also has another business:  he owns a few head of cattle, which he raises for further resale.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Jasur would like to expand his business, particularly his crop farming activity.  However, he currently doesn't have the means to buy seeds for sowing.  For this reason, he has turned to MDO Arvand and requested a loan to buy seeds.  He is looking forward to a positive outcome and thanks MDO Arvand in advance for their

After working at a flower shop for several years, the owner closed it down, and instead of looking for another job, Fernanda and her sister decided to open their own.

Since that time, she has gone to cosmetology school and graduated from a prominent beauty academy in 2012.\r\n\r\nThis mother of two initially worked out of her home, doing hair for her friends and family.  She was forced to stop for almost a year due to some heath complications, but now that she is healthy, she is looking to putting a renewed focus on her business.  She is hoping to direct a lot more energy towards working from her home, with the ultimate desire of opening her own salon in the future.\r\n\r\nFernanda will use the loan to purchase the essential equipment and inventory for her business such as a chair, industrial dryer, dyes and colors, product, and some marketing materials.\r\n\r\n\u201cI love to make people feel good about themselves and

Meet Ruth, a hardworking, very honest and warmhearted farmer who hails from the Nkubu area of Kenya, an area that has one of the best weather patterns on earth that favors farming. Ruth is the proud mother of one lovely child that she really loves and adores and always protects. Ruth\u2019s upbringing was very challenging and because of this, she promised herself that she would work hard and get out of the poverty situation. That is why she started farming 10 years ago and through farming she has been able to earn a decent income. Ruth is the breadwinner in her family and this really pushes her to work hard so that her angel will have a bright future and her parents will have a comfortable life.\r\n\r\nRuth is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming so that she can use the excess space on her land and she dreams of buying more land and increasing her horticulture farming.\r\n\r\nAccessing funds is very difficult for a woman in Africa but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, Ruth is optimistic that her dream will be realized and her life will completely change.\r\n\r\nThrough the income from horticulture farming, Ruth will assure her child of a bright future and she will be able to pay tuition fees for her siblings who depend on her. Through your loan, the promise of supporting small scale farmers will be achieved.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1794648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-15T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-14T03:30:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.83,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":6369.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":6555.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6747.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6944.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":7147.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":7356.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":7571.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":7792.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":8020.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":8254.72},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":8495.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":8744.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.97},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.16},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.72},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.4},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":161.33,"local_amount":14519.78,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":14715.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262776},{"amount":150.21,"local_amount":13519.09,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":13701.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601156},{"amount":163.19,"local_amount":14872.45,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:12Z","rounded_local_amount":15073.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.06,"payment_id":681378029},{"amount":162.4,"local_amount":15350.41,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":15557.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.16,"payment_id":711506007},{"amount":345.04,"local_amount":31738.27,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":32167.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.61,"payment_id":752111009}],"funded_date":"2015-01-19T03:26:30Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":827929,"name":"Sopio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sopio is 24 years old, and she lives with her parents and brother in Senaki district. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is her father's and brother's monthly salary working as hired workers.

She has 10 years of experience in the business and regular customers who provide her with very good personal and work references. The current loan will be used to buy more animals like pigs, ducks, chickens, among others, and also to make repairs and maintain the place where she raises them (corrals). With this, Miriam hopes to offer a greater variety of animals to her customers, and in that way satisfy their tastes and preferences, which she will see reflected in a higher level of sales, which will allow her to improve her and her family's quality life.

It erodes human rights of the affected, whether women or men. Poverty subjects an individual to a state of powerlessness, hopelessness, and lack of self-esteem, confidence, and integrity, leading to a situation of multidimensional vulnerability.  As many people in Kenya are poor, with the women bearing the brunt of it, reducing its impact as well as breaking its vicious circle requires a concerted effort and a gender perspective in all the interceptive strategies. The commitment of Juhudi Kilimo to eradicate poverty is manifested in its current strategy to make available loans to women smallholder farmers.\r\n\r\nLenders! The above picture presents to you Jane, 36 years of age. She is very ambitious and enterprising, and a go-getting woman who hails from the Kerugoya area of Kenya. She is a proud mother of two, and has been doing mixed farming for the past five years. Her primary sources of income are maize selling, crop selling, and some personal business that she does to make ends meet. Jane loves farming and has even nicknamed her cow, and she really takes good care of her dairy cows. \r\n\r\nThe Kerugoya area has favorable conditions that favor horticulture farming; good soils, good climate, a good transport system and a ready market for horticulture products. Jane wants to take advantage and start horticultural farming. She is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming, and through improved income she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children. The financial benefits that Jane will reap are almost immediate, and hence she will be assured of a secure future. She plans to start exporting her horticulture to international markets once she has accumulated more profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400.87,"image":{"id":1794690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He is the last born in a family of six. He got educated only up to the secondary level before having to drop out to make ends meet. He started farming two years ago. On a 2-acre piece of land, he keeps 1 cow, 2 goats and 13 heads of poultry. He also employs irrigation techniques to grow crops both for food and to sell in the market. \r\n\r\nAs the planting season draws closer, Benjamin is worried about not being able to afford pricey farm inputs such as fertilizer. This threatens his food security and income since animals in his farm also rely on feed for milk production.

El negocio pertenec\u00eda a sus padres pero ahora ella es la encargada. \"Desde peque\u00f1as mis hermanas y yo ve\u00edamos c\u00f3mo se esforzaban, nos ense\u00f1aron todo acerca del negocio porque dec\u00edan que era lo mejor que nos pod\u00edan brindar\".\n\nAntonia necesita un pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en su peque\u00f1a tienda y comprar leche, huevo, pan, az\u00facar, sal, frituras, aguas, refrescos etc. Est\u00e1 muy agradecida con el apoyo porque cada vez que recibe el dinero tiene la oportunidad de comprar m\u00e1s variedad de productos para mejorar el servicio a sus clientes. Desafortunadamente, en la comunidad de Antonia hay tiendas m\u00e1s grandes y eso ha provocado que sus ganancias sean cada vez menos, pero tampoco quisiera cerrar su negocio. \u201cPor eso mismo hemos recurrido a los pr\u00e9stamos, para no dejar caer nuestros negocios\u201d. Normalmente, con sus ganancias adquiere cosas personales como ropa, zapatos, alimento, etc. y tambi\u00e9n apoya econ\u00f3micamente a su mam\u00e1. \n\nAs\u00ed como Antonia, las dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo est\u00e1n muy contentas y agradecidas porque han podido hacer crecer sus negocios y adem\u00e1s porque en estas fechas sus ventas son a\u00fan mejor y necesitan del capital para invertir. Rosa Aurelia invertir\u00e1 en la venta de ropa y Elisea en sus artesan\u00edas.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en las escaleras del quiosco del municipio. En la foto ellas aparecen con algunas piezas artesanales de Elisea. Antonia es quien viste el su\u00e9ter blanco.\n","en":"The \"Colin\" group is composed of three hard-working women. Rosa and Elisea are very outgoing, and Antonia is more reserved; however, they have a close-knit relationship, and they always support each other.\r\n\r\nAntonia is 51 years old. Currently, she lives with her mother, and, in spite of being a reserved woman, she enjoys being in touch with the people she already knows. For the past 30 years, she has been running a small grocery store, to which she has added the sale of dried hot peppers. The business used to belong to her parents, but now she runs it. \"Ever since we were very young, my sisters and I used to see the efforts they made; they taught us everything about the business because they used to say that it was the best thing they could ever give us.\"\r\n\r\nAntonia needs a loan to invest in her small store and buy milk, eggs, bread, sugar, salt, beverages, deep-fried snacks, soft drinks, and the like. She is very grateful for the support because each time she receives the money, she has the opportunity to buy a wider variety of products to improve her customer service. Unfortunately, in Antonia's community there are larger stores, a situation that has caused her profits to decrease. However, she wouldn't want to close her business. \"For this reason, we have resorted to take out loans so that we don't let our businesses go under.\" Usually, with her profits she acquires personal items such as clothes, shoes, food, and the like. She also supports her mother financially.\r\n\r\nLike Antonia, the other group members are very happy and grateful because they have been able to grow their businesses and also because around this time, their sales are even better, and they need the money to invest. Rosa Aurelia will invest in selling clothes and Elisea in her handicrafts.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken on the stairs of the municipal bandstand. The group members appear with some of Elisea's handicrafts. Antonia is the one wearing a white sweater.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3675,"image":{"id":1772505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy milk, eggs, bread, sugar, salt, deep-fried snacks, beverages, soft drinks, and the like.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santa Ana Nichi, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-31T05:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-14T05:10:02Z","loan_amount":3675,"lender_count":104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":54000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":9000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:59Z","rounded_local_amount":9055.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980708},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":9055.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423860},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":9055.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769191},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:55Z","rounded_local_amount":9055.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649763950},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":9055.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597486},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":9055.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682140893}],"funded_date":"2015-01-19T16:58:47Z","paid_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Flores","image":null}},{"id":827963,"name":"Hanane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanane is a married woman and a mother of three children.

The loan will be used to stock enough clothes for the store so as to attract more customers, and will help Esther to generate greater profits. Esther takes care of her family, so some of the capital will be used to pay for rent where they are staying. Esther hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business into a bigger store that will include even men's clothes. \r\n\r\nEsther is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Meet Eunice, a 59-year-old mother who is so humble, honest and a very hardworking woman on this planet Earth. Eunice is a mother and she really loves and adores so much her family and will always do anything good so that they never go to bed with hungry stomachs. Eunice hails from the Kerugoya area of Kenya. Eunice never got the opportunity to advance her education and get a white collar job but this did not kill her dream of wanting to succeed in life. Eunice started farming and has been doing farming for the past three years. Through those years, she has gathered so much experience and all the farming techniques are at her fingertips. Eunice practices mixed farming on her farm and through the profits she has managed to take care of her family's needs and give her children a good education because she believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success\u201d. \r\n\r\nEunice is a woman who is very enterprising and she is seeking a loan of KES 50,000 to start horticulture farming on her farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, Eunice wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits.\r\n\r\n Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women like Eunice to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. Eunice hopes that through the loan, she will improve her living conditions. Eunice\u2019s dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year, she will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. Through this, she will be able to assure her children a secure future and uninterrupted learning because she will be able to pay tuition fees on time. Eunice is not a selfish woman and also wants to impact positively on society. That is why she will employ people to work for her on her horticulture farm, hence having an impact on society."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":511.04,"image":{"id":1794730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-15T05:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-14T05:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.06,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.08,"local_amount":7916.58,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":7943.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262780},{"amount":85.72,"local_amount":7792.32,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":7818.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601160},{"amount":87.23,"local_amount":8029.63,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:13Z","rounded_local_amount":8056.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.1,"payment_id":681378033},{"amount":93.1,"local_amount":8889.4,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":8919.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.68,"payment_id":711506012},{"amount":148.85,"local_amount":13830.17,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:43Z","rounded_local_amount":13876.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.28,"payment_id":752111013}],"funded_date":"2015-01-15T16:39:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":827967,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To purchase fish and resell them in the local market.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She has an eight-member family and they don't have any significant income for their existence. The family belongs to the subsistence poor category and lives in poverty. The family members get social assistance from the local government. Apart from this, they have a small agricultural activity. In particular, they own a milk cow and four calves, and they sell cheese and milk locally. In addition, Leila's family owns a small plot of agricultural land where they grow potatoes and haricot.\r\n\r\nLeila has a great desire to do her bit for her family's welfare, and to somehow increase their income. To realize her plans, she requires financial support and has obtained credit from local financial institutions. Leila requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions provisions for business start-ups and restart-up credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, and lack of access to credit products. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, she will purchase a minibus and will rent it out daily to generate a stable income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family's income and the family members will be able to improve their living

He is married to Yolanda, a housewife, and has two children. He works hard to provide income for their everyday expenses. <br \/><br \/>Silvestre owns and oversees operation of his jeepney service. He has one (14-16 person capacity) jeepney. Jeepneys are the most common form of public transport throughout the many islands of the Philippines. Most of the time, the jeepneys are constantly packed with passengers. Jeepneys offer one of the cheapest ways of getting somewhere. They are one of the remnants of the American military presence in the Philippines during the second World War and are still to be seen throughout the Philippines, in many colors and all over the place. Originally, jeepneys were old American jeeps. They were used in the war against the Japanese army which occupied the Philippines for several years. After the Japanese army was defeated and the American military mission was completed, the jeeps were left by the tens of thousands on the islands in the Philippines. The Filipinos saw possibilities to make out of these jeeps. They saw a real transportation means by making these jeeps about two meters longer and by putting two long seats in them, one on each side from the front to the back. Since then, jeepneys have been used as small buses for cheap transport of people, goods, and even sometimes little animals. Jeepney transport service is one of the stable businesses in the Philippines. <br \/><br \/>To help Silvestre continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan which he will use for repairs and maintenance of his jeepney. It is very important that his unit is always in good running condition to ensure efficient service. He is assured that his jeepney is well taken care of. His earnings from his service is their means of living. He thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given him. He wishes evryone a Blessed New Year!<br \/><br \/>Silvestre hopes that their transport service will continue to be successful. He dreams for his children to get the best education. Every week, He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies. <br \/><br \/>* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She is able to generate income for her small family. Alicia makes traditional skirts called \u201ccortes\u201d that she later sells in the region\u2019s big textile market. Her business enjoys increased sales during the busy season of the year, especially for special events, and so she has additional employees to help out. But most of the year, she works alone.

She wants to increase her income and profits, with the goal of seeing her children complete their education. Alicia is very aware that education is key to a successful and prosperous life.\r\n\r\nKIVA investors are much-appreciated partners for these women.

He is 37 and a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. He is married to Maribel and they work very hard to sustain the family needs and business.<br \/><br \/>Julian operates a tricycle. His tricycle carries up to four passengers. In the Philippines, especially in the provinces like Silang, a tricycle is a common means of transportation. Jeepneys and buses are limited. Very few people own a vehicle. The town people usually ride a tricycle from their homes to market, church, to their friends' homes and to other destinations within their community. They even transport from one town to the other. He earns a minimum of PHP 500 a day. <br \/><br \/>To help him continue his transport business, he is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan which he will use to pay for gas and maintenance of his tricycle. He is positive that this will boost his income as tricycle transportation is really a necessity in their place.

Miguel used to pile it up outside his farm, where it was smelling bad, attracting flies and contaminating underground water sources. He also used to spend an important part of his income on the purchase of LP gas to cook and heat water in the house, as well as chemical fertilizers for his field. By investing in his biodigester, he is transforming these two operational challenges into an opportunity to become more self-sufficient. Indeed, he will be able to produce his own biogas and organic fertilizer by inputting his cows' waste in the biodigester, thereby also treating the waste.

Here the people work in farming and cattle-raising.\r\n\r\nAnd it is here that 44-year-old Juana lives. She is married and has four children with her husband. Two of the children are now adults and study at university while the youngest are twins and are in school. Juana's husband is a school teacher.\r\n\r\nJuana likes to work and earn her own living and thus help her husband with household costs and paying for their children's education. Juana has a small grocery store that is well stocked even though it is quite small. Juana also works selling Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes and women's accessories). She sells Yanbal from her shop and door-to-door. Juana starts work at 7am when she opens her shop. She sells Yanbal products on credit and collects payment every eight days.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy supplies to stock up her shop, perfumes, creams and cosmetics. Juana has been with the loan group for five years and she likes it because, with the loans, she is able to move forward in life.

The nearby villages also suffer from dirty and unsafe drinking water. Suan is excited that she, like her group members, was able to purchase a water filter. Most families report a threefold reduction in diarrhea after they begin using the filter; this is because the filter removes bacteria and other water borne diseases. The water filter also increases disposable income to users like Suan due to the decreased cost of purchasing charcoal, by decreasing time spent foraging for wood, and decreasing the amount of money used to purchase bottled water. The filter is guaranteed for 2 years, though most find the filter works from 3-5

She remembers that she had to walk 10 minutes and wait for a shared taxi or bus at the side of the highway. The trip was long, and she did something to change the situation. \r\n\r\nShe began the store with a few kilos of beans, sugar, cheese, and soup, but with her earnings and the loans that she has requested, little by little her inventory has expanded. Currently, she needs to purchase more soup, rice, beans, oil, sugar, cheese, eggs, chilies, onions, tomatoes. corn, cookies and soft drinks, which is what her customers consume the most. \r\n\r\nRosa is very satisfied with her business since in addition to getting earnings, she keeps busy with something productive and doesn't neglect her family. Among her plans for the future are establishing a larger retail space despite there being two other stores very close by. To attract more customers, Rosa always looks to have a variety of products in her store, offer them friendly service, and to serve people even if they come looking for her after 8:00 at night, which is the time she closes. \"I well know that my store is not a commercial center, but it meets the needs of my customers.\" Rosa is grateful for the opportunity to get a new loan to maintain her work. \r\n\r\n*The photo was taken at Teresa's house.

Anteriormente, el acceso a la comunidad era muy restringido, fue entonces cuando naci\u00f3 su negocio facilitando a sus clientes el acceso a la mercanc\u00eda. Los precios, el surtido y el trato a sus clientes es lo que hace que su negocio contin\u00fae activo.\n\nHace poco menos de un a\u00f1o, Gloria incorpor\u00f3 algunos productos de papeler\u00eda a su tienda ya que noto que la \u00fanica tienda de este tipo en la comunidad tiene horarios muy limitados.

For the past 20 years, she has worked selling groceries, outfitting a space in her house with her husband's help. She began the work with the strong purpose of helping with the household expenses. Previously, access to the community was very limited, it was then that her business was born, helping her customers access merchandise. The prices, assortment and customer service are what make her business continue.\r\n\r\nA little less than a year ago, Gloria included some paper goods in her store since she noticed that the only store of this kind had very limited hours. Some of her neighbors also can purchase sheets of paper, pencils, pencil cases, white out, pens, notebooks, cardboard, bond paper, glue, highlighters, and tape, these being the merchandise in highest demand by the students. \r\n\r\nNow she needs to invest a little capital in her grocery store again, since she wants to purchase rice, sugar, oil, beans, corn, soup, tuna, cookies, coffee, milk, flour, canned chilies, cookies, sweets, and soft drinks, which are the products that she sells the most. \r\n\r\n*The photo was taking in Yenssy's house.
