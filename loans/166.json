(Osh region, Kyrgyz Republic).  He is married and has four children.  Shirinbay was born into a simple family of a shepherd.  He was the oldest among his brothers and, thus, devoted the most time taking care of the household and helped his father to take care of livestock.  After finishing school, he was drafted into the army in 1979, where he served two years.  After the army, Shirinbay went to the agricultural college in the city of Osh to learn the profession of a grain production technologist.  He also got married that same year.  At first, he lived with his parents in his native village and got a job in the agricultural collective.  Having saved some money, Shirinbay bought a small house in the Kara-Dobo village (Panfilovsk district, Chuysk region, Kyrgyzstan) in 1991.  The family grew vegetables and kept livestock on the land allotted to them by the collective farm.  As Shirinbay's family grew, so did their needs, and they decided to move to the Novonikolaevka village because it is located near the city of Karabalta (Jayilsk district, Chuysk region, Kyrgyzstan), which is the center of the district.  Their business gradually developed.  Shirinbay used the profits from selling livestock litter and milk to buy himself a car, which he uses to this day to provide people with a taxi service.  Also using income from animal husbandry, Shirinbay married off his daughter, two older sons and helped one of them to buy a house nearby.  Currently, thanks to Shirinbay's entrepreneurship and persistence, his business has 20 dairy cows.  In order to continue increasing livestock headcount, Shirinbay requested a loan in the of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.  In the future, Shirinbay dreams to eventually marry off his youngest son and bring his friendly family with grandchildren together at one big table in his home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":869938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Novonikolaevka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shirinbay","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":15822},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":16051},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":16452},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":16863},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":17285},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":17527}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":352.04},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":357.13},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.06},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375.2},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":384.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":389.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":352.04,"local_amount":15822,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:28:49Z","rounded_local_amount":15873.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232751292},{"amount":357.13,"local_amount":16051,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":16102.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238555516},{"amount":366.06,"local_amount":16452,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":16505.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244514679},{"amount":375.2,"local_amount":16863,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":16917.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722483},{"amount":384.59,"local_amount":17285,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":17340.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125416},{"amount":389.98,"local_amount":17527,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":17583.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250562}],"funded_date":"2011-09-17T21:43:58Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T08:43:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":339645,"name":"Marlene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marlene tiene 41 a\u00f1os, se destaca por ser una mujer muy din\u00e1mica y trabajadora, convive con su pareja y el menor de sus hijos, pues los tres ya son mayores e independientes.

She is married with 5 children aged between 1 and 14 years. They all go to school. She is a farmer and she has been growing maize for the past 6 years. Also her husband is a farmer. With the loan from Kiva, she would like to pay workers who harvested maize. The profits from the business will be used to improve her welfare and pay school fees of her children and to buy a cow.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She has owned a general store for a year. She took advantage of the fact that her house is located in a very busy area by a central highway that travelers and truck drivers alike constantly frequent to purchase her products. Her neighbors also shop at her store, which is why she gets up very early everyday to attend to her customers. On weekends she goes out to purchase goods to restock her store with everything her customers need. In the future, Amanda would like to convert her store into a mini market. This is the first time that Amanda requests a loan from MFP, and she is very enthusiastic about working in a solidarity group in her microfinance institute.

One of her children still attends school. She has been practising mixed farming for over 30 years in Kisii town, Western Kenya. Her farm produces maize, beans, tea leaves, millet, chicken and vegetables, which she sells at the local market and at the Kenya Tea Development Authority. She also earns income by selling both new and second-hand clothes and operating a kiosk.\r\n\r\nBelibetua has requested a loan of 30,000 Kenyan Shillings from Juhudi Kilimo to expand her cereal business.

WCSL Primary School was founded in 1942 by the Weslyan Mission to help educate the children of Kalangba Chiefdom. Currently, the school is staffed with 21 teachers and 422 pupils. This school is proud of the many doctors, teachers and other professionals that have passed through it.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that this school has applied for from SMT\/Kiva lenders. Daniel M. M. is their leader and headmaster at the school. Daniel, age 53, was born in Kalangba village and has been in the teaching profession for 35 years now. He is married and has nine children: four in secondary school, three in college and the rest are now grown-ups and living on their own accord. \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. With the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers repay their loan out of their monthly salaries.

Angela is very content because she is able to help her husband with the school expenses of their youngest son, who still lives with them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":804249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purcahse a new grill and kitchen implements.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2011-07-13T12:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":503.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221712532},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:50:36Z","rounded_local_amount":503.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227082932},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":503.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232844559},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":503.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238659432},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":503.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244613520},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:44:13Z","rounded_local_amount":503.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250828731}],"funded_date":"2011-07-18T20:57:37Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:44:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":319154,"name":"Rufina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rufina is 63 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She is married and has 2 adult-aged children. To making a living, B\u00ecnh owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. B\u00ecnh has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately VND 5,000,000 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, B\u00ecnh joined Kiva's partner, SEDA, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. B\u00ecnh has successfully repaid a previous loan of VND 4,256,000 from SEDA. This previous loan was used to renovate the existing shelter for her livestock. B\u00ecnh is now requesting a new loan of VND 6,048,000 which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This will be the sixth loan B\u00ecnh has borrowed from SEDA. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nB\u00ecnh l\u00e0 43 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

The juice that comes out is put into jerry cans. Sorghum is mixed and covered in a previously dug hole for a week or two and the end result is Tonto. For waragi, the tonto is again put into metal cans and placed on a fire with a tube that connects to two more metal cans from which the boiled tonto moves and is cooled to make waragi. <P>\r\n\r\nIn a week, Jane can make and sell 10 jerry cans of tonto and 10 of waragi as she also sells to her daily customers who drink at her home.

For economic reasons, he had to remain at his father's side to help him support the family.  In order to enter the working world (having never gone to school), he decided to make an income notably through commerce in seeds and pesticides.  In addition to selling the items cited above, he does spraying in gardens and houses.  He learned how to do this from his uncle over a two-year period.  In his search for supplemental financial resources, he has decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program, with which he is on his first loan. \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, he intends to buy 40 packets (bags of different seeds) and 3 boxes of pesticides to spray houses and gardens. \r\n<p>\r\nHe gets his supplies in Bamako (the capital of Mali) from establishments specialized in this domain.  With customers composed of public organizations and of individuals (gardeners and owners of villas), he makes his sales in cash or on credit.  His sales figures are high, and he envisions realizing a monthly profit of 35,000 francs CFA, which will essentially be used to expand his enterprise.  His ambition is to become a wholesaler one day.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

He is married and has a son who is 20 years old.  His plans for his family are to finish construction of his home since they lack secure doors, repair the wall, and tile the floor since it is currently exposed dirt, so that his family may live in better conditions.  Francisco has been employed as a taxi driver for 10 years through which he provides transportation services to various clients of the capitol.  He began the business with a loan to purchase a taxi unit and was able to do so.  His goal in business terms is growth.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has been a member of the Baye Laye savings institution since November 2009 and has already had one loan. He supports his family, is married and father to two children of 17 and 22 years old; he also has responsibility for four other people. As a result Mr. D. has been developing a small business for over 20 years. It is an activity he chose out of love and also because of its lucrative aspect. He is requesting a loan of 100,000 francs to buy millet, corn, peanut and other food products which can be sold on the market. He has no fixed place in the market but when he gets back from his travels he places his products immediately with his customers. This loan will allow him to increase his profits by 35,000 francs per week and per trip. The increase in his earnings will allow him to resolve his rent problems and manage his daily expenses better.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":547077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Strengthening of working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-05-28T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djiby","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:27Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971420},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708710},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922741},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-04T14:22:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189256},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484675},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620919},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-27T11:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188758492},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-19T11:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191495395},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195923366},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201365786}],"funded_date":"2010-05-29T02:42:10Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:19:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":208529,"name":"Paz En La Tormenta Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En uno de los Centros Focales de Pro Mujer Panamericana, se re\u00fane la Asociaci\u00f3n Comunal PAZ EN LA TORMENTA, con 8 integrantes. \nUna de las integrantes y presidenta  es Mar\u00eda F.

Parda is 55 years old and is married with eight children. His wife works as a teacher in the local school.\r\n\r\nFor many years, Parda has lived very happily in his small house surrounded by his plantation and the \"Good Morning\" of a beautiful sunrise every day. He rises before sunrise and, with love and hope, he works the field that generates his family's income.\r\n\r\nParda is applying for a loan of 4,500 Somoni with which to buy the supplies necessary for the maintenance of his crop, including seeds and fertilizer. These supplies will guarantee the quality of the harvest to which he has dedicated many hours of work during many months.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Otilia is 57 years old, and has six independent children. She never went to school because her father did not consider it important. Mrs. Otilia is a native of Huancabamba (Piura), which is where she met the man who is now her husband. She went with him to live in Cascas, where they had farmland that her husband irresponsibly sold.  They then went to live in Trujillo with their six children; she felt the need to work now that her husband did not contribute to the home. That\u2019s how she started her business selling snow cones, fruit, and sandwiches in the streets of the city. Sometime later, some friends told her she could do better by selling assorted frozen novelties, so she switched gears. \r\nCurrently, Mrs. Otilia lives in the Huanchaco district in the department of La Libertad and devotes herself to selling popsicles and gelatin desserts; during the summer, she employs three other people in selling her products. During the winter, she sells used clothing in the La Libertad sierra and in cities in the junble. With her first $100 credit that she obtained from the interim group \u201cRadiant Sun\u201d of Manuela Ramos, she purchased candies to sell; she did that for a while, but had to give it up because the city police constantly moved her away from the area where she sold on foot.  With this loan from Manuela Ramos for $250 to be paid in four months, she will buy sugar for next summer. Mrs. Otilia dreams of having savings enough to retire comfortably in her old age. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Shannon Skoglund, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Otilia tiene 57 a\u00f1os de edad, no estudi\u00f3 porque su padre no lo consider\u00f3 importante.

Eliza thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

D., who was born in 1974 in the city of Managua, is married; her husband works as a security guard, supporting  Maritza and covering the monthly household expenses.They live in the Waspan Norte neighborhood. Maritza is the mother of 5 children, only 2 of whom still depend on their parents. Maritza works in the eastern market in Managua, selling fast food and beverages. She prepares the food in her house and carries it to her food stall in the market. The worst misfortune that has occurred in Maritza's life has been a loan that she requested 4 years ago. As she left the bank with the 5000 US dollars in cash, she was assaulted. The experience stripped her of the hope of working to improve her life and the lives of her family members.  To repay the loan that was stolen from her, she had to sell her market stall and restart her business from scratch. These days she wants to try again to improve her sales. With the new loan she will buy a freezer for the beverages and will imcrease her inventory of raw materials. This investment will benefit her economically; the increased earnings will be used for new projects in the family's lives.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":476196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase raw materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-01-23T21:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariza Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":185.58,"local_amount":3839.51,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3878.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874574},{"amount":88.46,"local_amount":1830.11,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1848.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639909},{"amount":92.6,"local_amount":1915.95,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1935.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821692},{"amount":91.37,"local_amount":1890.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1909.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561700},{"amount":90.18,"local_amount":1865.7,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1884.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770628},{"amount":176.81,"local_amount":3658.39,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3695.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204518}],"funded_date":"2010-01-23T22:47:27Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Corcoran","image":65927}},{"id":175333,"name":"Kanda Sellers Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pictured here are members of the Kanda Sellers Group.

Miranda, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a clothing sales (RTW) business. Her husband, Donato J., is 49 years old and works as a vendor and also helps in his wife's business. The couple has five children between 15 and 26 years old. Mariluz joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mariluz has been lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. One of her previous loans of 19,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP, greatly improving the family\u2019s standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan, Mariluz is requesting a loan of 19,500 PHP to use as additional capital to buy more clothing to sell so that she can continue to save for future home repairs. Mariluz  J. is a Project Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward achieving her dreams.\t \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable).

The school is staffed with five teachers and has enrollment of 72 pupils. \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other school's staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans.  With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise have not been able to accomplish with their salaries alone.  But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children.  Others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in a business.  At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries.  The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayments to SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\n47 year old Juliet is the leader of this group of teachers.  Juliet was born in a place call Siama, in eastern Sierra Leone.  She is married and has two children, one of whom is in college.  Juliet has been in the teaching profession for 26 years now.

His farm brings him a good income. There is no waste produced by the farm, as any by-products are used to feed the animals. Since a new cattle feed supplier has opened, he has started raising meat cattle. He fattens animals and sells them for meat, which provides him with a good income. He would like a loan to support his business. It is important to purchase feed and more cattle now, as prices will increase closer to winter. Siyarkul would like a loan to purchase cattle feed wholesale, and a few heads of cattle that he can fatten up in time for the holidays. He is hoping for the generosity of kind people.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":115404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Ndigwako would like to purchase material and accessories to sew new items to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-01-16T21:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ndigwako","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-30T22:45:59Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":34285.71,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-31T09:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":34380,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145853},{"amount":30,"local_amount":34285.71,"processed_date":"2008-03-31T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-31T09:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":34380,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":170121},{"amount":30,"local_amount":34285.71,"processed_date":"2008-04-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-31T09:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":34380,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196953},{"amount":30,"local_amount":34285.71,"processed_date":"2008-05-31T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-31T09:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":34380,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":224210},{"amount":30,"local_amount":34285.71,"processed_date":"2008-06-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-31T09:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":34380,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":253257},{"amount":25,"local_amount":28571.43,"processed_date":"2008-07-31T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-31T09:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":28650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":282197}],"funded_date":"2008-01-16T22:45:59Z","paid_date":"2008-07-31T09:07:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":35628,"name":"Yusuf","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yusuf H. is 35 years old, married and has two children.

Two years have passed since Rossy made that decision and she rents her tables to pool enthusiasts, who rent them for hours, providing her with the money to sustain her family.<p>\r\nThe little corner where Rossy puts the tables has become too small, her customers have to wait until the other players finish their games, or they simply find somewhere else to go. Now she wants to expand, spruce up the environment and purchase two more tables. To accomplish her goals, she is requesting a this loan. Though she failed one, Rossy got back up and keeps pushing forward--help her.<p>\r\n\r\n<b><p>Translated from Spanish to English by Laura Jung, Kiva Volunteer<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nRossy es una mujer valiente, tiene 32 a\u00f1os y la juventud que posee la utiliza al m\u00e1ximo; en la atenci\u00f3n de sus hijos, en su casa y en su trabajo. Hace a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s inici\u00f3 un negocio de venta de comida, pero el momento de las alzas de alimentos y la poca demanda la llevaron al fracaso. Tiempo despu\u00e9s, ocasionalmente, le ofrecieron dos mesas de billar usadas, las que compr\u00f3 con lo poco que le hab\u00eda quedado de dinero, han transcurrido dos a\u00f1os de esa acertada decisi\u00f3n y Rossy viene alquilando sus mesas para que aficionados a este juego se las alquilen por horas y as\u00ed obtener el dinero para el sustento familiar.El rinconcito donde Rossy puso sus mesas ha quedado chico, los asistentes tienen que esperar a que otros acaben su juego, o simplemente se van a otro lugar. Ahora ella desea ampliar, arreglar el ambiente y comprar dos mesas adicionales, para ello es que est\u00e1 solicitando este pr\u00e9stamo. Si una vez fracas\u00f3, Rossy se levant\u00f3 y ahora sigue adelante, ay\u00fadala."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":180077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"Improve her business environment and purchase two additional Billiard tables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-07-16T18:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rossy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-01T12:37:04Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":285.6,"processed_date":"2008-09-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:14:30Z","rounded_local_amount":296.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":313108},{"amount":105,"local_amount":285.6,"processed_date":"2008-10-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-02T07:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":296.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":344287},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":278.79,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:18:01Z","rounded_local_amount":289.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335312},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":283.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":293.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9956490},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":283.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:59:27Z","rounded_local_amount":293.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10226746},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":283.35,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":293.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422025}],"funded_date":"2008-07-18T12:37:04Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T20:01:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":60208,"name":"Ang\u00e8le Afi","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Mrs. Angele D. was born in 1964 and is originally from the city of Aneho.

Thanks to the support that the agrarian reform offered, she obtained land and with her own efforts she managed to establish a pineapple farm.  The most difficult problem for her is that she does not have sufficient capital to maintain her crops, since they are affected by plagues.  If she manages to apply all the necessary fertilizers she will be able to have a good crop to repay the loan and provide profits to improve the conditions of her dwelling.

Third, the diligence and long hours one employs in that business directly benefit the entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nBefore this happy mother of 6 set forth in her food sales business 20 years ago, she took the time upfront to explore and evaluate her prospective business and goals. Then she drew up a well thought out and comprehensive business plan to ensure she reaches her goals. Her pro-activeness, perseverance and resolve have come in handy in helping her notch up many successes.\r\n\r\nJuliet sells high flavor foods and crops such as coffee, beans, ground nuts, maize, etc. at one of the biggest food markets in Rukungiri. Before she took root in this business, she worked in housekeeping. On the side, she has a modest retail outlet. She says the gross sales income from this business totals 250,000 Uganda shillings a month.\r\n\r\nThis is the third loan cycle for Juliet's borrowing group.

This group-lending method strengthens social needs in the community and helps ensure that members cooperate to help one another repay their loans and invest wisely in their businesses and families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":51720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Equipment for business expansion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"San Pedro de Macor\u00eds","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2007-07-30T21:55:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-14T12:19:27Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-09-14T09:23:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-15T10:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":54606},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-10-14T09:24:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-15T10:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":67378},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-11-14T10:25:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-15T10:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":81473},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-12-14T10:26:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-15T10:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97076},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2008-01-14T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-15T10:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":115575},{"amount":130,"local_amount":130,"processed_date":"2008-02-14T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-15T10:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":130,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":135217}],"funded_date":"2007-07-31T12:19:27Z","paid_date":"2008-02-14T10:19:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":19259,"name":"Ramiz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Ramiz is a vulnerable, low income person.

He is 44 years old, married to two wives and father of 7 children -- their ages are 8, 10, 16, 16, 17, 19 and 21 respectively. Besides his own children he also supports a nephew by sending him food.  Financial difficulties lead Artur to quit school after completing the 7th grade. In 1980, he moved to the Maputo province by himself to look for work; there he worked as a housekeeper, and later he worked for the national institute of social sciences. In 1984, he joined the Mozambique\u00b4s defense armed forces and, in 1994, he began his business activities -- he has been involved with many types of businesses since then. Aside from his armed forces career, he also runs a commercial establishment that sells many different kinds of products; beer stands out because a case of it can be bought for 230,00mt and sold for 280,00mt, generating a monthly net income of 1500,00mt. This will be Artur's third loan through Hluvuku and first through Kiva; the previous two loans were used to purchase parts for his vehicle. He wishes to pay back the loan before its term date so he can request another loan that will be used for  home restoration purposes.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice,

T. is from the village of Usocan, Plaridel, Misamis Occidental. She is 39 years old. Fe is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Fe owns & operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Fe has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fe joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fish to sell. Fe is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Fe from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Myrna is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like beverages and canned goods.  This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Myrna from HSPFI.

She lives with her partner, Dan, with whom she has two children ages 16 and 14. They have their own home. Berita is a seamstress, a job that she learned at a very young age. She helped her cousin to to this work for three years, during which time she has been able to learn everything she needs to know to do this work, gain clientele, and become known. Then, she became independent and opened her own workshop in her home. Her customers' demand has increased, and she has now been working alone for six years. She enjoys being able to count in an income with which to cover her household costs, since her husband travels a lot--he is a gold miner and works in the jungle rivers. Berita does not enjoy the physical strain caused by the long hours of sitting in the same position, but this does not discourage her and she keeps working. In the future, she wants to expand her business and open a boutique in her home. This is her fourth loan with MFP. She feels comfortable with the members of her communal group; she considers them to be responsible and united people. With the amount requested, she will invest in the purchase of materials for sewing, such as fabric, thread, elastics, and buttons."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":913975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, thread, and buttons.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-11T17:40:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Berita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":229.79},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":238.35},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":237.43},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":256.09},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":265.65},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":272.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.36},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.02},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":88.09,"local_amount":229.79,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":238.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621990},{"amount":91.36,"local_amount":238.35,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":246.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836072},{"amount":91.02,"local_amount":237.43,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":246.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245832},{"amount":98.17,"local_amount":256.09,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":265.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385865},{"amount":101.83,"local_amount":265.65,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":275.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098955},{"amount":104.53,"local_amount":272.69,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:09Z","rounded_local_amount":282.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713087}],"funded_date":"2011-11-17T16:48:50Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":364328,"name":"Amani Shg Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Amani Group in Western Kenya!
