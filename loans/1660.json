The store's primary customers are their neighbors. \r\n\r\nAlexander has been able to manage the store successfully and to finance his family's daily needs with the help of Paglaum Cooperative, which he joined in April 2012. Alexander was able to avail himself of two loans and repaid them religiously. He has now applied for a loan of 10,000 PHP to finance additional stock for the store.

On average, she is able to make an income of USD 2.00 a day.\r\n\r\nChrep wants to improve the general living conditions of the entire family by having a latrine to use, because there is no latrine in her house now. Therefore, she is asking for a loan from KIVA to build a latrine. By doing this, she can help her family members gain access to sanitation, promote their health, and help to lessen environmental deterioration.

He has the equivalent of a high school education and works in the city market selling spare parts and tools such as hammers, pliers, nails etc. for a living.  The money he makes selling these items is the main source of income for his family.  Dilmurod's wife works out of home sewing Tajikistani dresses for women, and his children are in grade school.

Here is her story:<br \/><br \/>\u201cI was born and finished the 2nd grade in Oi-Bulak village in Issyk-Kul region of Kyrgyzstan. After that we moved to Bishkek due to my father\u2019s work. We rented a house, saved money and just in 2012 were able to buy a flat here. There are four in our family: my father, my mother, my younger brother and me. My mother is a housewife and my father is the only breadwinner in our family. The salary of my father is hardly enough for our daily expenses, as we eat, pay utilities and pay for our education. My brother studies at one of the local high schools. We have two more members of our family, two daughters of my uncle, who died in 2001. His daughters study at school and my father supports them in order to give them an education, so that they could be able to be independent in the future.<br \/><br \/>I had hard school-days when I transferred to the school in Bishkek in the 3rd grade. I felt the significant difference between the education system of rural and town schools. I had to study more than others, train extra at home, and catch up with my classmates. Thanks to God and my mother\u2019s help, I was able even surpass my classmates and in the 9th grade entered the Kyrgyz-Turkish High School for girls. I learnt Turkish and English, became an Olympiad participant and graduated successfully.<br \/> <br \/>I think I live when I study and learn more about the world. I look at my father and see how hard he is working and only just meeting the ends.

the father of two children, the great desire to see them all grow up to be professionals is what fills Hillary with enthusiasm and inspiration. Hillary is 30 years old and works tirelessly to raise animals. Through these humble tasks, he aspires to offer all of his children a university education. Hillary learned to do farm work at a young age, thanks to his parents. He has a tiny plot of land to live off \u2013 just under half an acre \u2013 and has always struggled to support his family. Hillary has developed the farm in the sloping undulating terrain by successfully adopting suitable soil and water conservation methods such as stone pitched bench terracing and digging rain water storage pits. For over five years his income source has been from selling milk, poultry, and vegetables. He supplements the meager income by doing other personal business. Hillary passionately loves dairy farming. Milking and feeding his own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. He is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in his village. Dairy farming is close to his heart and every day he wakes up to milk his cow and that makes him very proud. Although he makes profits through milk selling, he lacks a proper dairy unit and he is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan he will have a humble time milking his cow and also feeding it. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from getting diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Hillary believes that through this loan his living conditions will change because he is going to have an increase in milk production. He will save money that he used to spend on treating his cows because he lacked a good dairy unit. <br \/><br \/>He is hoping for a great year in 2015 in which he can generate employment In his dairy business"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1795177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To build a modern dairy unit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-15T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-14T19:10:04Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hillary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4300.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4426.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4555.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4689.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4826.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4967.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5112.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5261.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":5415.43},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":5573.7},{"due_date":"2016-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":5736.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":5904.28},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6076.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6254.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6437.17},{"due_date":"2016-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6625.3},{"due_date":"2016-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6818.92},{"due_date":"2016-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7018.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.57},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.95},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.8},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.81},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.01},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":828209,"name":"Namig","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Namig and his wife have been married for seven years and have two children.

He is married and a father to five children and a grandfather to ten grandchildren. For the past twenty some odd years, Abdulotip has practiced crop farming. He has had a love of nature since he was a child, when he and father would work in the fields and take care of cattle. After the death of his father, Abdulotip decided to continue his business. Now he has over 15 hectares of land on which he grows fruits and vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, melons, and apricots. After gathering the crops, he transports the entire harvest to the market and sells it. Despite his age, Abdulotip is always spry and full of strength. He wants to buy seeds to plant and organic fertilizers for treating the soil. However, he does not have the entire amount of needed money. This is why he turned to MDO Arvand for financial support.

Due to the extreme poverty in which she lived with her parents, it was impossible for her to study.  For that reason, she does not have an academic degree. When she reached legal age, she decided to get married. Now she has two children who go to school. The first goes to second grade and the last to kindergarten. Her husband does not have an academic degree either, and he works in agriculture and selling bread.\r\n\r\nNolvia has worked for many years taking care of the home and, at the same time, when she got married to her husband, he taught her how to farm and in that way she learned about agriculture. Now they also work selling bread. She gets up very early to carry out the household chores and later at six in the morning she goes to sell bread to neighboring homes. Her husband also goes to sell bread and he does it in another zone in order to generate more profit and cover the basic needs of the household.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy a motorcycle to go sell bread to neighboring communities, and in that way make it easier for her husband to transport himself.\r\n\r\nNolvia\u2019s dream is to grow her bread sales, to generate more profit, and to be able to give her family a better quality of life, and also to have her own bakery, since the one she works in now belongs to a neighbor."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1772474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a motorcycle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-12-31T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-14T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nolvia Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":42.32},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":43.61},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":49.13},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":46.45},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":49.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":53.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":53.01},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":56.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":57.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":60.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":61.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":62.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":66.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":66.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":69.55},{"due_date":"2016-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":71.06},{"due_date":"2016-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":73.71},{"due_date":"2016-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75.48},{"due_date":"2016-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":77.79},{"due_date":"2016-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":80.69},{"due_date":"2016-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":82.46},{"due_date":"2016-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":98.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.13},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.62},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.47},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.06},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.93},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.36},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.88},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.55},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.06},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.71},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.48},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.79},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.69},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.46},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauren Potter","image":1606278}},{"id":822974,"name":"Eladio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eladio tiene 65 a\u00f1os, es viudo.

He would like to invest in the purchase of raw materials, including ebony wood, and to bring on more carvers at his workshop.\r\n\r\nBright has been selling through NOVICA since 2012. This is his story:\r\n\r\nI am a wood carver who is objective and respectful. I started to learn the skill of carving at age 12 when I\u2019d go to visit my father at his workshop when I returned from school. I observed closely what he and his team made and, I must admit, I was surprised at how they could turn wood into such beautiful items. I developed an interest in knowing more and was willing to learn how I could try my hand at it. \r\n\r\nI was a business student in senior high school but upon completion, my father could not further my education due to financial reasons. I worked with my father at his workshop for about three years. During this period, I was allowed to sell the items I could craft and this offered me the opportunity to buy my own tools to be able to set up on my own. I finally got a place of my own in a location where lots of people come to purchase hand-carved items. I did very well at this market through the sale of my work, which afforded me the opportunity to further my education, and also assist my younger siblings through school. \r\n\r\nThrough this craft I have been able to build a shelter for my family. I have also had the opportunity to train several students who study art in school and want to improve their skills. My inspiration comes from my  wife, children, and friends. My hopes, plans, and dreams for the future are to build an art and crafts college where interested youths can be trained to improve their standard of living in the country.\r\n\r\nI thank you for this opportunity. It will go a long way toward helping me craft more sculptures and increase my inventory.\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Bright's hand-carved sculptures on the NOVICA site:\r\n<a

Three years ago she took over the care of her nephew, whom she loves as if she was his mother.  Karina learned to make tortillas by hand when she was a little girl.  Her mother taught her, and she has been selling this traditional Mexican food for 2 years.  Mondays through Saturdays she gets up at 5am to wash the corn that she cooked the previous evening, and later she grinds it, turns on the light, and opens her business.  Each day she sells about 500 tortillas.  Karina must take good care of her hands, since they are her main work tool.  In addition to this activity, Karina also rents her mill to other people who make their own tortillas.\r\n\r\nWith her earnings, Karina covers the bi-monthly payment that covers the electricity that the mill uses, and she also buys firewood and contributes to the household finances.  As with her previous loans, she will buy corn at wholesale and a new griddle, and she will also do maintenance work on her mill so that she can keep her business running.  \"I'm thinking about starting up a new business, so that I can make use of my free time in the afternoons and increase my income.\"\r\n\r\nNote: the photograph was taken in front of Francisca's house.

Almost all of the fields are covered with this fruit, although one also tends to see lime, papaya, and orange trees.

She is married to Filiberto and has three children. The youngest of her children is 15 years old. She does not know how to read or write due to the fact that she did not study. Therefore, she unfortunately had to start working from a very early age to help her parents take care of her siblings. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda R. used to make a living by buying and reselling bread with the purpose of giving her children the quality of life that she did not have. \u201cI will never forget the day in which my son told me: \u2018Mom, why don\u2019t you make bread to sell instead of buying it?\u2019\u201d she says. When Filiberto arrived at the house after a day of work, she told him the little one\u2019s idea and that was how they started their own bakery 5 years ago. The invested their savings to buy materials to build a stone oven where the bread is cooked over a wood fire. They also bought flour, sugar, butter, and food coloring. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning, Mar\u00eda R.\u2019s biggest fear was to not be successful and that her investment would be in vain. Today, her bakery employs 7 people. She, her husband, and her brother-in-law prepare the bread. \u201cI like to sell. For this reason, after I finish making the bread I carry 80 pieces in my basket and I go out to sell them to the neighboring communities,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nThanks to the two loans that she received before, she was able to buy baskets, sugar, butter, flour, and firewood, continuing her bakery in this manner. Due to the fact that the coldest months in the region are arriving, the inhabitants tend to buy more bread. For this reason, Mar\u00eda R. needs to buy more ingredients and materials to take advantage of the season. \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in Ma Filiberta\u2019s house.

He studied through high school and currently is 19 years old. He is the youngest of three siblings. The three of them work in the carpentry business, which they learned from their father who has more than 30 years of experience. A little while ago, between the four of them, they made one of his mother\u2019s dreams come true by rebuilding their house.\r\n\r\nEver since Ir\u00e1n was little, he was interested in his father\u2019s work. For this reason, in his free time he went with him to whatever project he was working on at the time. This helped him quickly learn all of the processes, and just a year ago he also started making a living in this line of work. He uses the salary that he receives for his services to buy tools for work. He helps his parents with the household expenses and he takes care of his personal needs. Every once in a while he also paints houses. Many times, they are the same houses that he helped build. \u201cWe are not only a family. My brothers and I are a great team on the job,\u201d he says. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Ir\u00e1n wants to update his work tools and he needs to invest in a level, a tape measure, a mallet, a chisel, wire, a shovel, a pick, a drill, and a polishing machine to continue facilitating his work. Although in the moment his family works together on their projects, Ir\u00e1n has not discarded the idea of giving work to two or three people so that they can work under him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you for trusting us. We will not break the trust that you have placed in us. On the contrary, we will take full advantage of this great opportunity,\u201d Ir\u00e1n comments.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in the main street.

Los integrantes del grupo consideran que el mayor atractivo de la comunidad es un ojo de agua ubicado en el cerro.\n\nEl nombre del grupo lo eligieron pensando firmemente en lo que ellos quieren alcanzar con cada una de sus actividades.

The group members consider that the community's main appeal is a spring located in the hill.\r\n\r\nThe members chose the name of the group believing very strongly in what they wanted to achieve with each of their businesses. The group members are the following:\r\n\r\nAngela \u2013 sells fruits and vegetables\r\nSalome \u2013 sells shoes by catalog\r\nMaribel \u2013 sells cosmetics\r\nDelfino \u2013 sells hot dogs\r\nSusana \u2013 sells typical Mexican snacks\r\nEstela \u2013 sells tacos\r\n\r\nEstela is married to Herminio, with whom she has two children: an 11-year-old girl and an 8-year-old boy. Fifteen years ago, seeing that they needed more income to cover their household expenses, she began to sell steamed tacos outside her home. With the help of her husband, she set up an awning, three tables, and a crate where she kept the steamed tacos warm. In view of her success, now she sells other types of tacos such as tripe and meat marinated with hot peppers.\r\n\r\nHer customer service and the flavour of the meat are what makes it easier for her to keep on selling. Furthermore, she is the only person in the community with this type of business. Other people have ventured into this field; however, they have been unable to carry on with the business.\r\n\r\nWith her profits, she has helped out her husband with the family expenses. She reinvests in the purchase of meat, napkins, vegetables, tortillas, and soft drinks. \"My family is my driving force because by having their support, I have been able to keep myself motivated and eager to continue with my business.\" \r\n\r\nThis time she needs to buy more meat, hot peppers, tortillas, and soft drinks, which are the inputs that she uses the most.\r\n\r\nEstela is grateful for the support to keep on granting the loans that will make possible for the businesses of all the group members to flourish.\r\n\r\n*In the photo, which was taken at Maribel's, Estela can be seen holding her nephew.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":1767448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is married to Angeline, a house helper and he has children. He works hard to support the family's daily expenses and the schooling of his children who are still in the elementary level.\r\n\r\nRaymund operates a buy and sell business. He buys various products such as plastic ware, household items, slippers, and toys from wholesalers and sells them for a little profit. He goes around their town and customers are attracted to buy because of the low price and convenience. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 900 (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations, he is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan to buy additional products and merchandise to expand his product inventory. This will definitely boost his earnings and enable him to meet the family's daily needs and to support his children's education. He wishes everyone a Blessed New Year!\r\n\r\nRaymund desires to have a place of his own to display his items. He wants to give his family a better life and send his children to good schools.

three children. He has fifteen hectares of his own land, where he grows crops. He grows fruits and vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, cucumbers and fruit trees, on his field. Muhadamin gathers the entire harvest by himself and transports it to a market for sale. His product always sells well because Muhadamin grows his crops with love and care. He has three small children, and he works tirelessly in order to save money for this children's future. Muhadamin wants his children to get a good education and be able to provide for their lives.

She is 26 years old and lives happily with her family in a community called Guineales. Each passing day, Manuela is always thinking about her future and, also, in the wellbeing of her children. This woman, to help her husband, had the idea of starting a small store with staple products.  The store was successful, but it was very small and lacked many products that her customers asked for, so she made the decision to expand the store. Thus, she sought a loan to buy more products to satisfy customer demand, and she gave thanks to God that she received a loan. However, the demand in her store increases every day, and again Manuela has decided to look for a loan to be able to invest more. She uses the income she generates to make up what is missing to pay household expenses. Currently, her goal is to put in a second store and, with her earnings, she will some day be able to buy land that her children, when they are older, could inherit.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Salvador earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house and his regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. Salvador has a charming personality so people prefer to buy at his store. He earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him improve his income, Salvador is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan to buy grocery items such as sacks of rice, corn, charcoal, sugar, cooking oil and beverages. He thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given him and for a good return on his investment which will greatly help provide for his family's needs and his children's school needs.\r\n\r\nSalvador dreams that his children will become professionals. He aims for his store to grow so he can provide a better life for his family. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of his work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1795277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items, beverages and toiletries to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-01-16T14:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-15T14:40:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salvador","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:11:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2671.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757463},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2671.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200600},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3339.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186880},{"amount":30,"local_amount":1333.29,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1335.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535908}],"funded_date":"2015-01-16T20:45:14Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":828284,"name":"Amina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amina lives in Kampala, Uganda.

is 39 years old, married, and has two children. He is a farmer from Kiamuthambi village, situated in the central province of Kenya. He is dedicated to his work and only thinks about going forward and delivering good products. He knows that many people consume his products, and because of this, he is determined that his products are pure and of good quality. \r\n\r\nAnthony lives on a small piece of land where he keeps cows and grows a wide variety of crops, which he has been doing for 10 years. His primary sources of income are milk and horticultural produce. His biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals, to prevent these diseases. Anthony joined Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help him improve his farming activities. \r\n\r\nAnthony requested a loan, which he will use to expand his horticulture farm. This loan will enable him to expand his operations to increase the overall output. The additional income from the expansion will go toward his children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is increasingly becoming prohibitive to low-income communities, especially in the rural areas. As a result, children are forced to drop out to start working to contribute their earnings to their families. With this loan, Anthony's children will acquire quality education that will act as a strong foundation for their future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":329.27,"image":{"id":1795314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

It is commonly sold as street food in the Philippines. <br \/><br \/>Neriza is asking for a loan to purchase ingredients like sugar, flavoring, ice cream cones and many others. These ingredients will be used in  producing more ice cream and could reach a huge volume of output. It could create higher earnings and she would be able to roll over her capital. In the long run, she will be able to manage her income and start to settle her obligations.<br \/> <br \/>She would be grateful that she could slowly recover from her previous situation and hopefully these results would be more productive and she is willing to exert much effort in expanding her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1795136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Meet George, a hard-working, 54-year-old go-getter. He hails from KiIne, a remote village in the Kerugoya area of Kenya. This area has harsh weather conditions and to survive, you must be tough. George has defied all the odds and has been engaged in farming for the past three years. He keeps dairy cows, poultry for eggs and grows maize and vegetables to sell. He also engages in small businesses on the side whenever an opportunity crosses his path. Despite the rapid fluctuation of prices in the market, George is very passionate and optimistic about the future of horticultural farming in Kenya. George is seeking a loan for his horticultural farm. This move is quite a big deal for him. With your loan, George seeks to continue growing different varieties of crops, but on a greater scale. The demand for vegetables and other greens in Kerugoya and other parts of the country is very high. Income from this venture will negate the high farming expenses he has to deal with currently. In the long run, with increased income, he will finally be able to satisfy his family\u2019s basic needs. He stated, \u201cIn the future, I will be able to provide food for my family and also educate my children.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge is a person who has had to overcome a lot of adversity in his life. However, he has always had the strength to move forward for the sake of his children. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":184.73,"image":{"id":1795346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To grow his horticultural farming business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-16T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-15T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.74,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.21,"local_amount":1707.75,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1752.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824826},{"amount":15.68,"local_amount":1394.13,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1431,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262785},{"amount":16.76,"local_amount":1489.69,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1529.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264982},{"amount":16.25,"local_amount":1444.62,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1482.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601168},{"amount":36.78,"local_amount":3310.18,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3397.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.46,"payment_id":681378040},{"amount":18.87,"local_amount":1709.4,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1754.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.36,"payment_id":696587700},{"amount":18.26,"local_amount":1703.75,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1748.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.91,"payment_id":711506018},{"amount":19.8,"local_amount":1809.56,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1857.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.56,"payment_id":731022829},{"amount":20.38,"local_amount":1851.86,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1900.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.45,"payment_id":752111020}],"funded_date":"2015-01-17T21:49:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":828330,"name":"Srorem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Srorem is an 18-year-old freshman who is pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree, majoring in hotel and tourism at university.
