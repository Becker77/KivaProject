In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store that sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 400 a day. <br \/><br \/>To help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan, which she will use to buy grocery items such as sacks of rice, charcoal, soda, and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment and the financial help that will be given her.<br \/><br \/>Vilma hopes to maintain and grow her business to give her family a better life. She strives hard to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. <br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He is a smallholder farmer from Kerugoya in the central region of Kenya. Abraham owns a one-acre farm. On the farm, he practices mixed farming. The loving father keeps dairy animals and grows maize and vegetables. He has seven years of experience in farming. Abraham is seeking a loan to expand his horticulture farm. He is very hardworking and determined to increase his farm's output. Loans for smallholder farmers with little irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Abraham. Through a group of 10 members called Gakui self-help group, Abraham has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which uses the group-based savings as collateral. According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Abraham because the institution believes that men, too, are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry. With your help, Abraham will be able to pay for his children\u2019s education, which is one of his biggest dreams."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":187.36,"image":{"id":1795364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To expand his horticulture farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-16T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-15T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.16,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abraham","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.97,"local_amount":3286.61,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3373.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262786},{"amount":33.84,"local_amount":3008.04,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3087.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601169},{"amount":36.75,"local_amount":3306.52,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3393.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.45,"payment_id":681378041},{"amount":36.57,"local_amount":3413.35,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3503.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.83,"payment_id":711506019},{"amount":40.07,"local_amount":3640.02,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3736.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.88,"payment_id":752111021}],"funded_date":"2015-01-18T11:16:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":828361,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna is 56 years old and from Estancia, Iloilo.

She has five family members and they don't have any significant income for their existence. The family belongs to the subsistence poor category and lives in poverty. They have a small agricultural plot. In particular, they own a milk cow and own a small plot of land where they grow potatoes. Liana has a great desire to do her bit for her family's welfare, and to somehow increase their income. \r\n\r\nTo realize her plans, she requires financial support and has obtained credit from local financial institutions. Liana has requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions provisions for business start-ups and restart-up credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, and lack of access to credit products. With the received credit, she will purchase a minibus and by helping her husband she will begin trading in fruits and vegetables. Her husband will be a driver and they both will be involved in their family business. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family's income and the family members will be able to improve their living

He resorted to farming after buying a piece of land from his small savings for he is a teacher and he earns a monthly salary. He immediately started planting tea plants so that he gets an income for his family. He borrowed UGX 2,000,000 only to buy fertilizer for his tea plantations so he can trade in green tea leaves. Most of his clients are tea factories i.e. tea traders. He hopes to educate all his children and be financially stable later in life.\r\n\r\nHis source of income is affected by the drought (dry season) where outputs are not promising and yet the demand is too high. Again another challenge is price fluctuations which leave farmers in shock.

That's because all the members of the group had received training and gained knowledge about caring for pigs in the right way.\r\nEntering the sixth loan, there is a change in management to provide a new atmosphere in the group. Ni Nyoman, the former leader, was replaced by Ni Ketut and Ni Nyoman has now become treasurer.

I remember with much gratefulness a companion in the first workshop where I worked. He took a lot of time to teach me things I never imagined possible to do with my hands. Now I spend some of my time teaching the young people who work with me.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to thank everyone who supports artisans like myself. With this microcredit I will be able to buy the raw materials and tools I need to increase sales and improve my family's quality of life. May God shower you all with many blessings.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Diego's hand-carved wood art on the NOVICA site:<br>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/8047\">http:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/8047<\/a>"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":445.5,"image":{"id":1245207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to invest in a bulk purchase of wood as well as new equipment for his workshop, including a grinder and a lathe","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2015-01-16T23:20:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-15T23:20:23Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diego","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":13.41,"local_amount":13.41,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":13.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636433590},{"amount":35.33,"local_amount":35.33,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":35.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649702192},{"amount":66.33,"local_amount":66.33,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:59:13Z","rounded_local_amount":66.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665191279},{"amount":31.84,"local_amount":31.84,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T16:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":31.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681497880},{"amount":23.59,"local_amount":23.59,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":23.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696704558},{"amount":48.51,"local_amount":48.51,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T17:45:05Z","rounded_local_amount":48.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711636698},{"amount":156.49,"local_amount":156.49,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:32:42Z","rounded_local_amount":156.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731141899},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752228911}],"funded_date":"2015-01-17T04:52:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":7,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brian Arens"}},{"id":828649,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita is a 59-year-old mother who has two adult-age children.

Soungan\u00e9 is passionate about raising cows, and has been doing so for 5 years. He wants to grow his livestock business. In order to do so, he contacted RMCR. His loan will allow him to purchase skinny cows in order to fatten them for sale. He purchases his stock at the local markets and resells his cows at the large livestock market in the capitol, Bamako. In 4 months, Soungalo can make 35,000 CFA francs per head of cattle, which will allow him to ensure his children's well-being (food, clothing, school fees). \n\nThe organic fertilizer created by the cows will increase the productivity of Soungalo's cereal fields, which is another source of motivation for him. Contagious diseases affecting animals are often a problem for him in his business. \n\nHe thanks RMCR for the financial support and asks that they help him to do even better in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1771544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

At the end of that harvest, she obtained 50 quintals of coffee, which she sold at a very good price in the market in spite of decreasing prices.

He is able to make a good profit per day. \r\n\r\nHe is now requesting his sixth credit from Tujijenge Tanzania. He has paid back all of his previous credits successfully. Raphael normally uses his credits to improve his service; making sure his stock of cooking items is full (bought cooking oil, rice,beans, maize, baking flour and cooking stoves together with charcoal). He used the extra income as a father to cover school fees for his kids and family expenses. In the coming years, he would like to build a nice family house for his family.\r\n\r\nGenerally, his business has grown more after Kiva's loan support.

Her income from her store is a stable source to sustain her family's basic needs and for the education of her children.

She is based in Tinga village in the Nyamira region of Kenya. Her upbringing was difficult. She never managed to finish her primary education, but she is very determined to give the best life to her children. Fifteen years ago, Alice started farming on her husband's two-acre farm. She did it mostly for subsistence until recently. She now keeps a dairy cow that gives her 10 litres of milk to sell every day. She also grows vegetables that she uses to prepare food and to sell. Alice is seeking a loan to buy rabbits and start rabbit farming .The advantage of this type of farming is that rabbits grow fast especially if fed well, reaching maturity at 5 months and slaughter weight at 3 months. They also require less land (space) with diminishing land size; Therefore, they can be kept in the backyard. This investment will not only double the income that Alice is making from rabbit meat selling, but will also mitigate risks associated with having just one business. The additional income will enable her to comfortably handle her family's food and education costs, which happen to be her highest expenses. Please consider providing a loan to Alice to help her improve her economic activity. Support this mother who does the impossible to support her children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":144.73,"image":{"id":1795967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start rabbit farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-17T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-16T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.42,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1061.59},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1092.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1124.55},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1157.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1191.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1226.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1261.89},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1298.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1336.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1375.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1416},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1457.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.05},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.58,"local_amount":2449.95,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2607.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262791},{"amount":27.22,"local_amount":2332.93,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2483.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601174},{"amount":27.64,"local_amount":2399.37,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2554.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.35,"payment_id":681378045},{"amount":27.98,"local_amount":2517.99,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2680.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.4,"payment_id":711506023},{"amount":30.89,"local_amount":2704.8,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2879.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.67,"payment_id":752111025}],"funded_date":"2015-01-17T15:44:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":828590,"name":"Miguel Enrique","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miguel siempre se ha distinguido por ser un hombre muy creativo y responsable que sale a rebuscarse el sustento de su familia,  conformada por tres hijos y su se\u00f1ora, lo dif\u00edcil es que vive en una zona donde escasea el empleo y ahora que Interactuar lleg\u00f3 hasta esos rincones quieren sacar el m\u00e1ximo provecho del excelente proyecto que trae para ellos, confiando y brind\u00e1ndoles la mano cuando m\u00e1s lo necesitan.\nMiguel quiere solicitar un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de cerdos, adecuar un corral e iniciar formalmente un negocio en el que espera tener buenos resultados para poder darles a sus hijos una excelente educaci\u00f3n.\n","en":"Miguel has always distinguished himself as a very creative and responsible man who searches high and low for ways to support his family, which is composed of his wife and three children. \r\n\r\nThe difficult thing is that he lives in an area where jobs are scarce; and now that Interactuar has come to this corner of the world, he wants to make the most of its excellent program, which is bringing trust and lending a hand when it is needed most.\r\n\r\nMiguel wants to request a loan to purchase pigs, to set up a pen, and formally open a business.

Made up of eight women and two men, the members are all very hard-working and, with the help of loans, are hoping to move forward with their businesses, thus improving their families' quality of life. The members have different kinds of businesses.\r\n\r\nOne member of the group is 27-year-old Ver\u00f3nica. She has a partner and two children, ages six and three years old; the eldest in school. Ver\u00f3nica's partner is a lab technician.\r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica is a very good mother and partner who has always liked to work in order to get ahead and raise her children. She makes a living selling Avon products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and women's accessories). She works three days per week, spending two to three hours going round selling her goods. She sells on credit and collects payments once a week. Ver\u00f3nica has been doing this work for two years and it is going very well. Her highest selling products are perfumes and cosmetics as they are good products.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy perfumes, creams and cosmetics. This is Ver\u00f3nica's first loan cycle with the group and she likes it because the loans are very quick. Ver\u00f3nica's dreams are to continue moving forward with her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4925,"image":{"id":1795786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy perfumes, creams and cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2015-01-17T11:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-16T11:00:03Z","loan_amount":4925,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evelin Jasmin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amparo Piedad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ginger Liceth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario Yaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Yolanda Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara Maribel Reylima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jason Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jennifer Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Byron Xavier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ver\u00f3nica Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4917.13,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":491.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":491.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":491.71},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":491.71},{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":491.71},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":491.71},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":491.71},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":491.71},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":491.71},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":491.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":492.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":492.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":492.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":492.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":492.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":492.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":492.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":492.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":492.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":492.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1477.5,"local_amount":1475.13,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1477.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611785795},{"amount":985,"local_amount":983.42,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":985,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624232427},{"amount":984.99,"local_amount":983.42,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":984.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636218170},{"amount":984.98,"local_amount":983.42,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:42:15Z","rounded_local_amount":984.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649569816},{"amount":492.53,"local_amount":491.74,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:20:00Z","rounded_local_amount":492.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665050410}],"funded_date":"2015-01-17T14:53:29Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:20:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":828736,"name":"Iluminada","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of three children, Iluminada works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a restaurant business in the Philippines, and also earns an additional income from working in a general store.

Rural farmers in Kenya use such motorcycles to ferry passengers and transport farm goods to and from the market. This motorcycle is going to make one such farmer, Jonah, turn heads in the village and feel very proud.

He lives with his wife, Naomi, who he married over two decades ago. The couple has four children aged between 15 and 22 years old. \r\nAndrew owns 1.5 acres by the river on which he has been farming for close to 19 years. He keeps four cows, three chickens, two goats and one pig. He also grows coffee and 20 trees on this small piece of land. \r\nAndrew's biggest challenge is lack of rainfall over long periods of time. This has resulted in crop failures in the past. However, the assets Andrew is seeking financing for will help him to avoid losses due to unpredictable weather. Andrew is seeking a loan to buy animal feed and water pipes. The extra animal feed will build his inventory to carry Anthony's livestock through dry spells. The water pipes will become part of the irrigation system that he will use to provide his crops and trees with sufficient water for healthy growth. Andrew is very disciplined financially. He keeps a budget which is reviewed monthly, tracks every expense, and clears all his debts on time. His credit risk score is attractive and he has successfully serviced all his previous loans, the last being for 70,000 Kenyan shillings (KES).\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":537.01,"image":{"id":1796071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for animal feed and water pipes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-17T12:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-16T12:20:04Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.97,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3785.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3895.71},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4009.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4126.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4247.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4371.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4499.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4630.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4766.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4905.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5048.7},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5196.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5348.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5504.42},{"due_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5665.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.91},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.02},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.27},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.31},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.9},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.53},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.21},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.94},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":127.48,"local_amount":11514.48,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:36Z","rounded_local_amount":11641.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824829},{"amount":63.15,"local_amount":5703.96,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5766.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264985},{"amount":126.42,"local_amount":11418.35,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":11544.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459611},{"amount":104.47,"local_amount":9609.54,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":9715.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.92,"payment_id":696587702},{"amount":110.52,"local_amount":10258.22,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":10371.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.05,"payment_id":731022832}],"funded_date":"2015-01-22T14:56:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Seiji Humphries","image":null}},{"id":822193,"name":"Reina Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Reina es una mujer muy comprometida con su familia y desea continuar apoyando a mejorar sus condiciones de vida.

Moses is a 40-year-old farmer based in Mwirua location found in Central province of Kenya. He has a wife called Teresia and 2 boys and 1 girl aged between 6 and 15 years old. Family is everything to a man such as Moses. He takes utmost pride in being the head of his family and the chairman of Mwereri Horticultural Self-Help Group.\r\n\r\nThe group consists of smallholder farmers from his village who are struggling to grow their rural enterprises with lack of access to financial services offered by financial institutions. The aim of the group is to empower each member to grow financially. They achieve this through running their own table banking, and seeking financial services from organizations that accept group-savings as collateral. One such organization is Juhudi Kilimo. \r\n\r\nMoses is seeking a loan to purchase a water pump that will enable him to irrigate his land and grow more tomatoes. This investment is a life-changer to Moses since he will no longer suffer crop failure due to drought. If anything, this asset will change his fortune since he can grow as much tomatoes as he wants and guarantee that they will be well watered regardless of the unpredictable weather. \r\n\r\nMoney that will pour in in future from this investment will enable him to uplift the living standards of his family and take his children to schools with better learning facilities.

Gujarat. She is pictured third from left in the photograph. She runs a retail cloth-selling business that caters to the demand of the residents in her locality. The cloth is obtained from a wholesaler and when Zetunben sells the cloth at the retail price she makes a small profit that translates into her savings. Saris, dresses, drapes, pillow covers and other home textiles complete the range of items she offers for sale. In a typical month, her profit margin is roughly Rs. 3500 (~$58), give or take a few hundreds. \n\nNeither the pressures of life nor time have managed to slow her down. However, credit on reasonable terms is a constant impediment that prevents her from growing her small business. She is now in search of a loan that will help her purchase larger quantities of cloth and offer a greater variety to her customers. She anticipates that her income will see a quantum jump to Rs. 5500. In the absence of social security, this is her best path to maintaining a life of dignity and independence.\n\nMerjaben, who joins the other women in this group, runs a retail cloth-selling microenterprise like Zetuben. Saparaben, a mother of two, runs a vegetable vending business and Rasidaben is the proprietor of a small-scale fruit-vending  business. Your support will help them bring marked improvements to their lives, the lives of their families, and their local

She is married, 48 years old, and a mother of ten children, five of whom are currently in school while five do not study.\r\n\r\nShe launched her business with capital obtained from a local cooperative. She has sold palm oil and tomatoes for ten years. She will purchase forty liters of palm oil and two baskets of tomatoes. Her spouse is unemployed.\r\n\r\nShe wants to obtain further loans to increase her sales, send her children to school, and feed them. In conclusion, she thanks Hekima for its support to entrepreneurs excluded from traditional banking. It\u2019s worth mentioning that another client is carrying her baby in the picture.

Sonia purchased some materials and started renovating the workplace, but she hadn't saved enough money for all of the salon equipment. \r\n\r\nSonia requires financial support and applied to local financial institutions to get a loan. Her loan request was rejected several times because she hasn't enough income or business experience. The start-up program, a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, enabled her to get 2,400 USD for her new activity. The program gives people a chance to start or re-start their own businesses. Sonia will use the loan to purchase all needed equipment and to make a sign advertising the salon. The business will be a great help for this motivated woman and her family as the salon will be a significant source of income for them and will give them a chance to have financial stability.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Margaret\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 6.5 acres of land and purchase a total of 6 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1748787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase two solar lights and to gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-01-17T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-16T20:40:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ronald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonface","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":92500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-17T23:24:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":828822,"name":"Ratifa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ratifa is an active client of Humo.

He will utilize the benefits of this loan to buy leather and imitation leather in bulk, which will reduce his costs.

She works and studies at the same time, as she is enrolled at the Tajik State University of Commerce where she is majoring in accounting and audit.  She is a good student and enjoys the subjects that she has chosen.  \r\n\r\nThis year, Nargiza has also started to work as an operator at a local bank.  She successfully manages to combine her work and her studies.  The only thing that could stand in the way of her pursuing her studies is a lack of money to pay her annual tuition fees.  In order to solve this problem, she has applied for a loan.  She is looking very forward to receiving your support.  She wants to complete her studies at the university and receive a higher education degree.

The family gets income from selling milk products and nuts at the local market, however the income isn't enough for an 8-member family. Tamar takes care of her 4 children and doesn't have her own activity. The family also generates income from an agricultural business.\r\n\r\nIn the region there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make living.  So, she decided to start a clothing trading business with a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Tamar\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times as she was unable to satisfy their requirements.\r\n\r\nShe received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, a Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.

sewing women's national dresses from home. Muhayo is a kind and smart woman and she works very well.  She learned to design and sew women's clothes eight years ago and she is still involved in this activity, which she loves.\r\n\r\nMuhayo turned 48 this year.  She lives in the city of Khujand with her husband, her 23-year-old son and her mother.  Unfortunately, her husband is away from the family at the moment (he works in Russia and sends money to cover the needs of the family, every month). Thanks to the fact that she's making a living through her own work, Muhayo feels like an independent woman.  What she likes about her job is the income that she earns every day and the new contacts that she makes.  \r\n\r\nMuhayo is now taking a loan to buy a new embroidery machine which will help her to improve her working conditions and to attract a large number of customers.
