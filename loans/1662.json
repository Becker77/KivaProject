The family owns a commercial space, where Tamar plans to start that activity.\r\n\r\nNow, she needs financial support to purchase a stock of products and to have money for working capital to start trading. Tamar has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products.

She sells vegetables daily starting from early morning until late in the evenings for sustenance. She works very hard to be self-reliant and her motive in life is being independent in financial matters as long as she is physically fit. Hatneilam, the profiled borrower, is the lady pictured with her hand raised. She lives with her daughters in Tuibuong village, which lies at the outskirts of a mini-town. Her daily activities include buying vegetables from suppliers and reselling them in the market at slightly higher rates. She draws her income from fractions of profit she makes by selling vegetables. The income is used to provide all the household expenses. \r\n\r\nFinancial difficulty occurs at the time of school admission for her daughters at the beginning of new sessions. She desires to meet the educational expenses of the children by selling more varieties of vegetables, which is not possible without the help of an external source. With the Kiva loan, she will buy stock of vegetables including cabbages, tomatoes, potatoes, mustard leaves and others.

the Republic of Congo, to support his family of three. In order to help grow his business, Fabrice joined HOPE Congo in 2014 and became a member of the community bank group Les Bonnes Volontes (2). Within Les Bonnes Volontes (2), Fabrice helps lead a subgroup of eight other micro-entrepreneurs and is currently on his fourth loan cycle. \r\n\r\nThrough his previous loans, Fabrice was able to overcome the difficulty of having a stable supply of power to keep his meat and produce fresh, by purchasing a generator. Now Fabrice would like to take out a loan of 250,000 CFA to purchase additional chicken, fish, drinks and vegetables for his restaurant. In the future, Fabrice would like to be able to open a second and possibly third restaurant in Brazzaville.

For nearly sixteen years Simone has run her own grocery store from her home. In order to help grow her business, Simone joined La Restitution (2) last year. Now on her third loan cycle, Simone would like to take out a loan of 450,000 XAF. With this additional money, she can begin to buy items like vegetable oil, gasoline, rice and soap in bulk.<br \/><br \/>Simone and her family live in a more remote neighborhood of Brazzaville, and so Simone has a plan to become a wholesaler.

Drawing in clients with a clean, welcoming business, Roselyne always inquires after how her clients are doing. Little by little with the increase in her profits Roselyne has been able to build her home. She hopes to able to complete her home and open a second business selling drinks. Eventually she hopes to be able to travel to France or Benin to start a business in commerce. Roselyne also dreams of being able to send her children abroad to study and finish their education. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7650,"image":{"id":1796306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase clothing and towels in bulk to sell individually ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo (Rep.)","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2015-01-18T03:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-17T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":7650,"lender_count":260,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.04,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roselyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Michel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alban","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jocia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ange","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blandine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jules","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":4300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":7650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":315200},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":322400},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":329900},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":337600},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":345200},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":352700},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":361300},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":369800},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":377700},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":387000},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":395700},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":405500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":560.76},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":573.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":586.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":614.14},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":627.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":642.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":657.9},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":671.95},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":688.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":703.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":721.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1125.29,"local_amount":637600,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:54:22Z","rounded_local_amount":639266.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.04,"payment_id":624251124},{"amount":1187.53,"local_amount":667500,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-21T11:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":669244.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636253344},{"amount":1241.62,"local_amount":697900,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":699724.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649588430},{"amount":1300.68,"local_amount":731100,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":733010.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666509029},{"amount":2064.43,"local_amount":1160400,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:25:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1163433.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681367361},{"amount":721.41,"local_amount":405500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:32:00Z","rounded_local_amount":406559.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696577737}],"funded_date":"2015-01-19T16:29:50Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T14:32:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elise Addis","image":null}},{"id":828967,"name":"Mdidimua Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Richard, who is in his late 40s, is married with five children and all of them are grown-up.

Topics include accounting, budgeting, pricing, marketing, customer service and indebtedness. Other subjects discussed are hygiene, health, nutrition and the use of medicinal plants. The ladies gain knowledge as well as self-esteem and empower themselves. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d and it is truly effective.\r\n\r\nRosalinda and the nine Trust Bank members are anxious to begin their new loan cycle in order to work toward achieving their goals and dreams. They are hopeful that KIVA investors will have enough confidence in them to offer the additional loan capital they need.  The  members of the \u201cDulce Corazon de Maria\u201d Trust Bank are extremely grateful to the KIVA investors for their on-going support! We look forward to providing a follow-up report in the very near future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5175,"image":{"id":1796332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy beauty products and furniture including special salon chairs, hair dye and other supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Quetzaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.833333 -91.516667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-01-18T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-17T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":5175,"lender_count":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virgilia Menchu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Viviana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eloisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladis Mariela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Alba Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilia Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor De Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria Azucena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Florinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":39500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":5175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4939},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4939},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4939},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4939},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4939},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4939},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4939},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4927}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":647.08},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":647.07},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":647.07},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":647.07},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":647.07},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":647.07},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":647.07},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":645.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1294.15,"local_amount":9878,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":9902.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624231098},{"amount":647.07,"local_amount":4939,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4951.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636216828},{"amount":647.07,"local_amount":4939,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4951.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649567029},{"amount":647.07,"local_amount":4939,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4951.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665049185},{"amount":647.07,"local_amount":4939,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4951.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347044},{"amount":647.07,"local_amount":4939,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4951.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696557401},{"amount":645.5,"local_amount":4927,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4939,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711472361}],"funded_date":"2015-02-14T20:43:06Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T14:37:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katrina Drabeck","image":null}},{"id":828990,"name":"Ubaldo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ubaldo is 61 years old and has worked in his car repair shop for more than 35 years.

In order to reduce his operating costs and to protect his environment, Isidro decided to invest in his own Sistema Biobolsa biodigester, which will allow him to use his cows' manure to produce biogas and organic fertilizer. With these two environmental-friendly resources, Isidro will be able to improve his farm's productivity and save money by displacing the external inputs.

He started his business, HarryDz, nearly eight years ago in Portland, Oregon with a hot dog cart.

It was then that he developed a special sauce to make the pulled pork taste very unique, and his sauce also became a huge hit.\r\n  \r\nHe and his wife moved to San Diego in 2013 to be closer to their newborn grandchild and started the business over again.  HarryDz has become very popular at the Imperial Beach Friday Markets, where he sells his sauce and sandwiches to local barbecue lovers. \r\n\r\nHarry is also a gospel rap singer and has a website (www.harrydzfood.com) where he shows his farmers market stall and a video interview, which have made him a celebrity in his community.  \r\n\r\nNow, he would like to manufacture his barbecue sauce in larger quantities and needs capital to meet a minimum order.

She has a dream of giving a good education to her son and saving some money for her daughter\u2019s marriage."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1796600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase bangles, cosmetics, talcum powder, wafers, nail colours, shampoos, etc. for her variety store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhadrak, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2015-01-18T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-17T07:00:15Z","loan_amount":2925,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basant","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sailabala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bimalini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santilata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Panchali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janaki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanjukta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuntilata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kanakalata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":180000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":180000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":829177,"name":"Analyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Analyn is a married woman with one child whom is in school.

She lives in a village close to Bhadrak city in the Bhadrak district in Odisha. Sonali got married to a fisherman when she was 20 years old. Like other village folk, her husband was a fisherman who went to a nearby lake and river for fishing. Unfortunately, she lost her husband's mental and partly physical condition in 2009 in an accident when he went fishing. Since then, she has been working hard to support her children. She started the business of selling fresh fish and dried fish. \r\n\r\nDrying the fish is a way of preserving the fish for future use by drying them in the sun until the water is completely evaporated. Dried fish has a storage life of several years. Dried fish is used in different delicacies as fresh fish is and is very popular in the region. She buys fish directly from the local fishermen and sells some fresh and dries some to sell as dried fish. She purchases 10 to 12 kg of fresh fish and 18-20 kg of dried fish and sells it by roaming door to door in the nearby villages. She earns 4,000 INR per month. \r\n\r\nShe, along with her group, has applied for a loan of 195,000 INR so that she can use her portion to purchase the fish in a bulk to make more dried fish and stock up during the monsoon season. There is a huge demand for dried fish during the monsoon season as not much stock is available in the market. So she can get a better price as well. This loan will help her to increase her working capital to run her business by increasing her revenues almost 50%, giving her 5,000 to 6,000 INR per month. She wants to save enough to give her children a good quality of life and send them to college.

She is married with one 13 year-old son. Norma makes women's jackets. She is independent, enterprising, constant, responsible, and hard-working. She runs her business in the Villa Victoria zone, an area located in the hillside of the city where the streets are steep. The majority of the residents are ex-miners from different areas who were relocated. The climate is cold and dry, with a temperature that varies during the day between 2 and 14 degrees celsius. \n\nNorma is dark-skinned and short, with long black hair pulled back. Her mother tongue is Aymara, which she speaks with her family. For business, she speaks Spanish. She dresses traditionally (hat, shawl, and full skirt). She shares her life with her husband, who works in commerce, and her children, who study and work. They live in their own brick home which has drinking water, electricity, and plumbing. \n\nHer business is making jackets for women. She buys fabric of all kinds. The fabric is impermeable, and some is solid-coloured and others have designs. She sews the fabric into jackets of all styles and sizes. She does this work in a room of her home outfitted as a workshop. Her husband takes care of the sales, selling in various markets and commercial areas of the city.\n\n\"Women's clothing is constantly consumed more frequently than men's clothing. This is why I make women's clothing\", she says. Her dream is to make clothing wholesale for companies.\n\nNorma wants to purchase sewing material wholesale: fabric, clasps, buttons, threads, etc. This way, she will always have materials to work with and can take advantage of the season's festivities.

She is married and has four children, ages 12, 9, 6, and 2. She works selling cold cuts. She is a good mother and an entrepreneurial, independent, responsible and hardworking woman. She works in \u201cEl Torno,\u201d a place known for its great population growth due to the immigration of people from the country\u2019s western region. The city has warm tropical weather and a temperature of 30\u00b0C [86\u00b0F].\r\n\r\nMayer has a dark complexion, and long black hair tied back. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, but she speaks Spanish due to cultural reasons and because she uses it at work (she is standing in the center and is wearing a gray sweater and a black purse). She is married and her husband works in transport. Her three oldest children go to school, and the youngest one is still a baby. They own a brick house, which is served with electricity, drinking water and sewage.\r\n\r\nShe has a strong will to get ahead, which is why she led the creation of a communal bank where members have different activities, such as selling tomatoes, selling clothes, making dresses, selling fruits, selling empanadas, selling cosmetics and selling fish. This would help them to request loans and expand their businesses. Mayer sells cold cuts, such as ham, mortadella, and liver paste. She works at home, where she has a cold cuts store. She does not have a refrigerator, which is why she has to purchase small quantities in order to fulfill the daily demand. This results in a waste of time, expensive transport and even in ruined products because of the intense heat.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan from the institution and she has been in business for three years. Her dream is to see her children become professionals. She would like to expand her business by buying a display refrigerator in order to store her products and be able to display them to customers. This will help her to decrease her transport and have more time for her family.\r\n\r\nThis is why Mayer is requesting a loan to expand her business by buying a display refrigerator and be able to

She works in \u201cEl Torno,\u201d a rural community located 45 minutes by car from the city [Santa Cruz de la Sierra], and known for its agricultural products, which attract farmers and businesspeople from the city. It has warm and humid tropical weather, with an annual temperature that ranges between 21 and 35 \u00baC [70-95 \u00baF].\r\n\r\nEloina has a dark complexion, and long black curly hair. Her and her family\u2019s mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, but she uses Spanish at work. She is the third one from the left and is wearing a black tank top and pink pants. Her husband works in the construction sector and her son goes to school. They own a brick house with corrugated iron roof, served with electricity. The water they use comes from a well. \r\n\r\nThinking of a better future for her family, she led the creation of a communal bank, with members that work making leather purses, in the transport sector, selling meat pies, making skirts, renting videos, selling tableware and selling mobile phones. This would help them to request a loan and continue with their activities. She sells meals to people who work in offices, during their breaks. She sells cheese-and-mortadella, egg, beef, and chicken sandwiches, and hamburgers during the morning and afternoon breaks, properly wrapped. \u201cI start by baking the bread, for which I use an industrial oven I have at home,\u201d she says. Her dream is to supply all the offices and stores in the area during their breaks.\r\n\r\nShe wants to expand her business and buy different types of flour (e.g. rice and corn flour) by the quintal. This is her second loan with the institution, but she has been in business for thirty years.\r\n\r\nThis is why Eloina is requesting a loan to buy different types of flour by the quintal in order to

She develop her business in an area called \"Plan 3,000\", which is known for it's cultural diversity including indigenous Ayoria people and miners who relocated to the west of the country and settled there. The area was also settled by families affected by the droughts, poor settlers from the east, poor people from the west who were born in the remotest corners of the country and who went to the new neighborhood of Guaran\u00ed and also Chiquitanos among many other ethnicities. The area has a hot, tropical climate with an average temperature of 30 degrees centigrade all year round. \r\nYakelin has a dark complexion and long black hair. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed and she speaks Spanish in general and for her business. (In the photo, she is in the center, wearing pants and a black sweater). She lives with her children who are in school and the eldest works. They live in the house of some relatives, which is made of brick with a zinc roof and has drinking water, electricity, and city sewers. Her desire to overcome challenges lead her to become leader of the bank group comprised of people who run businesses such as: machine knitting, technical services, selling furniture, making chicken coops, selling quilts, making leather wallets, and selling empa\u00f1adas. They are requesting a loan to grow their businesses. Her business is selling drinks and sandwiches. The drinks she sells are sodas, bottled juices, and natural drinks made in the area. The sandwiches she sells are beef, chicken, and egg with avocado and sausages. She sells from an improvised stall on the edge of her house. She does this every day of the week. \"I decided to open my business because I saw there was nowhere selling food in the area. My customers come every day\", she tells us. Her dream is to have her own restaurant. She wants to grow her business by buying tables and chairs so that she can serve her customers in greater comfort. This is her second loan from the institution in 10 years of developing this business. \r\nIt is for these reasons that Yakelin is requesting a loan to buy tables and chairs. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1772558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables and chairs so she can serve her customers in good conditions.

She lives with her partner and has an 8-year-old son and a 4-year-old daughter. She works making dresses. She is a good mother, and an entrepreneurial, independent, responsible, and hardworking woman. She works in the southern part of the city, where around a thousand artisans get together in the \u201cLa Alasita\u201d fair to sell all kinds of miniature objects, which people hope will one day become real things.

She lives in a brick house with corrugated iron roof, served with electricity. The water they use comes from a well.\r\n\r\nThinking of expanding her business, she decided to start a communal bank with people that work selling groceries, meat, handicrafts, beverages, books, sandwiches and clothes. This will help them to request loans and improve their businesses.

She is 25 and is a resident of Tanza, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Abel, who is a production man. Together with her husband, Mary Ann manages her own household and makes and sells \u201catsara\u201d (the Filipino equivalent to pickle relish) and peanut butter. She works hard to augment her family\u2019s income to meet their daily household expenses. Atsara is an appetizer made from grated unripe green papaya and often served as a side dish for friend and grilled foods like pork barbecue. Mary Ann\u2019s peanut butter is also a favorite spread of the Filipino household. She sells per order and on demand for special occasions and holidays.  Mary Ann\u2019s regular customers are her neighbors and local community members and she earns a minimum of 700 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nMary Ann is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to buy ingredients such as green papaya, sugar, carrots, garlic, peanuts, oil and other items needed to make atsara and peanut butter. Her loan will help her continue with her business. Mary Ann is happy for the positive feedback about her relish and spread.

Azizmoh loves her work and copes well with it. She thinks it is convenient to sew from her home, as she in addition can do household work and look after the children. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Azizmoh will start a long-awaited renovation of her home, in order to improve the family's living conditions. She can see that she does not have enough money to purchase the building materials, and therefore she applied for a loan.

Sagynbubu is a college graduate; she works as a primary school teacher. As an additional source of income for her family, she raises livestock and grows farm produce, having launched this business in 1994. Thanks to Sagynbubu's hard work, she now owns four cows, 15 sheep, one horse, three goats and one colt. Sagynbubu's husband works as a private taxi driver. Her son works in construction. Sagynbubu's monthly salary is about 13,000 KGS; her revenue from her farm is about 5,000 KGS. In order to develop her farm further, \r\n\r\nSagynbubu has turned to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to buy young bulls for fattening and resale. Sagynbubu plans to invest her revenues in a further expansion of her farm, which will allow her to build an animal shed and eventually save up for her son's

She has four children; one is single and lives under her support while the other three are married and live independently. To make a living and support her family, she manages and operates a farming business on a small rice farmland which is located near her house. So far, she has been in this type of business for almost thirty years. On average, she is able to make an income of USD 4.00 a day.\r\n\r\nShe wants to improve the general living conditions of the entire family by having a latrine to use, because there is no latrine in her house now.

For Elias, it is a very nice job, and what he enjoys most is serving children.\r\n\r\nIn the community where Elias lives, there is not much work. This is one of the reasons for which he works outside his community. To arrive on time, he gets up early every day, and he does not have an established return time. The end of his work day varies because they depend a lot on the customers' demand.\r\n\r\nMuch of the time, it is hard for Elias to return because he can't find transportation. To maintain his position and not worry about how to return home, the solution is to have his own mode of transportation. He decided to request a loan to purchase a motorcycle.\r\n\r\nHe will pay off the loan with the support of his wife. She makes traditional clothing for a living. With this income, his wife will help cover some of the family's necessities while Elias can put a part of his income toward paying back the loan.\r\n\r\nElias' greatest dream is to use his experiences gained as an employee to one day open his one barber

Margaret also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Margaret's Group will be able to receive a total of nine solar lights, as well as farming supplies to plant a total of four acres.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1749693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-01-19T16:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-18T16:10:04Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladwell","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harrison","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dianah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Metrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":84160,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84160}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-19T20:57:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":829478,"name":"Margaret's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret's Group is formed by 12 farmers in Matete District and is being represented by Margaret, who is the group leader pictured above.
