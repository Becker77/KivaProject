Meet Priscilla, a youthful 55-year-old shosho (old mum) and a wise farmer whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Nkubu, in the central region of Kenya. Priscilla is happily married and together with her husband, is blessed with six lovely children. For the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been growing maize, cabbage, and tomatoes. She also keeps goats and poultry. Priscilla has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up and she says, \u201cI have to do something for my family.\u201d \r\n\r\nPriscilla mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. Priscilla is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. Perishable products such as milk, vegetable, and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price. Priscilla is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone to ride a motorbike and help with farm work. \r\n\r\nPriscilla is requesting a loan to buy a motorbike from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders. Her loan will help her achieve her dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Priscilla feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of her loan are astronomical. Priscilla will never suffer losses due to a delay in delivery of produce to the market and also, she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market and increase her income. With your loan, Priscilla will improve her living conditions and assure her children and grandchildren of a secure

He is very excited about this addition because now he will be able to have an overall improved quality of life.\r\n\r\nUsing this loan, Douglas's Group will purchase a total of 6 solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 5 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1745724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light, as well as hybrid seeds and fertilizer to improve their maize harvest.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-01-19T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-18T17:10:06Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Douglas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reuben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Purity","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonface","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sulumena","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vivian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jotham","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcyline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":82100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-17T18:10:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mindy D","image":1196705}},{"id":829570,"name":"Medina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Medina is a freshman at the American University of Central Asia, Department of Economics. Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow I have an opportunity to become the first person in my family to attend AUCA, though I\u2019m in need of financial assistance to realize what have been a long-term goal for me and a dream for my family.\r\n\r\nTill 2011 my father worked as a manager in one of the banks in our country, but then was fired illegally. Since then the financial situation of my family deteriorated sharply, because he was the only breadwinner in it. My father knew his job perfectly and was respectful by his colleagues. The happened issue worried us a lot and he is seeking for a new job, but it\u2019s hard to find a good job for him as the unemployment rate in our country is so high.  My mother is a housewife. Sometimes, she goes to the local market and helps my aunt in implementation of man\u2019s trousers. As we live in the village in Naryn region, we have livestock and we grow vegetable and fruit in our garden. According to the fact that our family\u2019s income is not stable, we always save money on everything, since this amount is very small for a living.\r\n\r\nAfter getting a Kiva loan, my goal is to continue to apply the same diligence to my collegiate studies as I have to this point, making education and service to others is my top priority. I will represent American University in Central Asia well during my years in the university and beyond. Please, know that this financial assistance will make a significant positive impact on my ability to continue in university and will greatly appreciated. I try to become an active member of the Society for university. I can assure you that I will be a dedicated professional that you will be proud to count among your ranks.\u201d

Later on, during my secondary and high school career until now, I have been receiving big support from my eldest brother.<br \/><br \/>Spending one exchange academic year in the USA gave me an opportunity to make improvements in myself and develop the other sides of me. As a result of my extremely active student life in Adrian High School, I was awarded with the Scholar Athlete award in Southeastern Conference, where I was honored with first place for participating in tennis. My maintained 3.25 better grade point average partly helped me to become the captain of my team and achieve the Sportsmanship Award. Also, I\u2019ve been presented with varsity letters in swimming, gymnastics and tennis. <br \/><br \/>Moreover, taking volunteering clubs such as American National Honors Society, I have worked on a voluntary basis for the Alexander Elementary School in Michigan, Adrian for a month. My missions were accomplished as a co-teacher to physically and mentally handicapped children for three months, and as a reader to blind children. <br \/><br \/>All of the above are some tools I have collected.

There is a lack of work in the village, as after the USSR collapse, many factories were destroyed or closed, and people began farming and growing livestock. We also have a small field, where we grow vegetables and fruits for ourselves and for sale, which serves as an additional income for us. My mother is unemployed due to her health and does household work. My elder brother is a student at the university, and the other two siblings are schoolchildren. Unfortunately, there is no work for students at all, and even many people with high education are forced to migrate to Russia in order to support their families.<br \/><br \/>I am a smart and hardworking student. I do believe that a university education is necessary and decided to apply for a Kiva loan to be able to get a degree at AUCA.<br \/><br \/>One of the main reasons for my choosing AUCA is that there is no corruption in it, and students are strongly judged just according to their academic performance and efforts. This gives a chance to me to be one of the best students of AUCA and reach my goals. After graduation, I don\u2019t want to be one of thousands in my country who have a diploma and can\u2019t find a job. AUCA provides its students with the best knowledge and critical thinking, gives them a chance to do an internship abroad, and enables them to continue studies at the Western universities; (this is)

Highlands of Guatemala. The climate is quite cool here. The majority of the population is Maya-kiche. They are very proud of their culture and wear their traditional clothing that is quite beautiful and colorful.\r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMacadamia\u201d was formed in Olintepeque by seven ladies. One of them is Damaris, who is a single mother of two children. At 31 years of age, she is very motivated and hardworking. Her time in school was interrupted when she gave birth to her first child. Damaris had to find work and was unable to secure formal employment, so she decided to sell used American clothing. Somewhat later, she decided to open a bookstore. The business has been growing, as it is close to a school. \r\n\r\nDamaris dreamed of even more expansion and joined the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank to obtain a loan to maintain her copy machine. She decided to buy school supplies, and purchased pencils, pencil sharpeners, crayons and notebooks.

She has a primary school education.  Since she was young, Estela has been involved in textile production and creates the beautiful and traditional textiles of the area.  Over the years, she has managed to save toward investing in more merchandise inventory in order to increase her income.  However, now she needs to invest long term and so she has joined the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank Vida. Currently, Estela is beginning a new loan cycle and needs to have a loan to buy blouses, belts, shawls and typical skirts in order to increase her sales and generate more income.  She has two goals: to continue to provide an education for her four adolescent children and improve her home.\r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank Vida is made up of six others ladies who have developed relationships with each other that are supporting and trusting. They meet once each month with a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer who spends a portion of the meeting sharing useful and important information with them. In order to successfully manage their loans, the ladies learn about effective business practices (business design, budgeting, pricing, marketing, customer service and accounting). They learn how to more effectively care for themselves and their families with newly acquired knowledge about nutrition, hygiene and health. The ladies also learn about self-esteem, violence against women and sexual abuse. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d and it is truly effective.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4125,"image":{"id":1797687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Because farming is her only source of income, she applied for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) with Bai-Tushum Bank to purchase ten sheep and use some of the funds for crops. She plans to use the profits she earns to expand her farm. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1530,"image":{"id":1793782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase ten sheep and cultivate the land in order to help bolster her income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kum Aryk village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-01-19T22:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-18T22:10:11Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":96.67,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":510},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":510},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":510},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":510},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":510}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":492.15,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":30037.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.85,"payment_id":711411341},{"amount":481.85,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":30037.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28.15,"payment_id":730933591},{"amount":459.33,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":30037.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":50.67,"payment_id":752025615}],"funded_date":"2015-01-20T18:59:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Hendrickson","image":null}},{"id":829079,"name":"Minerva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Minerva es una mujer de 49 a\u00f1os de edad, madre de nada m\u00e1s y nada menos que 6 hijos, su negocio consta de una confecci\u00f3n de l\u00ednea propia con la que ha podido solventar sus necesidades m\u00e1s b\u00e1sicas y aunque sabe que no tiene muchas cosas, que su casa es hecha en madera, muy humilde es feliz.\nMinerva solicita un cr\u00e9dito para comprar telas en grandes cantidades y su m\u00e1s preciado sue\u00f1o es construir su casa en material.\n","en":"Minerva is a 49 year old woman and the mother to exactly 6 children.

Mutabar's second daughter-in-law sews women's clothes.  Mutabar has long dreamed about learning how to design and sew women's clothes in order to start a new activity and make a living.  Thanks to her daughter-in-law, she learned this craft and would now like to start her own sewing business.  However, before she can start, she needs to buy a new sewing machine.  Because she doesn't have enough money, Mutabar has requested a loan which will allow her to buy a Yamata electronic sewing machine, as well as other necessary sewing materials.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, Mutabar will have a job and a stable income, which will help her to improve the financial situation of her large family.

Aside from financial assistance, she was able to generate savings and enjoys the benefit given by the co-op. She became a member in April 2013 and has taken out three loans. \r\n\r\nNow she is applying for 7,000 PHP to buy additional stock for her sari-sari store, particularly basic commodities.  In the future, she wants to own a mini-mart some day, and will be fully satisfied if she can renovate and expand her house.

Her business is making jewellery.\r\n\r\nVirginia is a good mother, enterprising, independent, responsible and hard-working. She works at her business in the Cotoca area, in the east of the city, known for its traditional foods and crafts, especially ceramics. It is a place with a warm, tropical, humid climate, with daytime temperatures between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade all year round.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Virginia is first on the right, wearing a green top and white shorts. She has a dark complexion and long black hair, and is short in stature. Her mother tongue is Guarani, which is spoken locally, and she also speaks Spanish for reasons of general culture and for her business. She shares her life with her children; the oldest studies at the [higher education] institute and the younger ones are in school.

Her dream is to have her own shop to exhibit her handicrafts. She wishes to expand her business by buying materials to work with, such as carved figures, tin wire, plastic beads, etc. This is her third loan cycle with the lending institution, and her first year working in this business.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Virginia is seeking her share of the loan, to buy materials to make her handmade jewellery and so generate more sales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4925,"image":{"id":1767486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy material for her handmade jewellery and increase her sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-01-20T06:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-19T06:10:02Z","loan_amount":4925,"lender_count":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura Jose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liz Neira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candido","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":34000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":4925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1746.39},{"due_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1944.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1971.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1999.82},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2028.28},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2057.15},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2086.43},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2116.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2146.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2176.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2207.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2239.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2271.07},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2303.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2336.18},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2369.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":281.61},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285.62},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.68},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.98},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.53},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":310.89},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":319.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":324.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.97},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1110.26,"local_amount":7664.72,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":7671.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554455},{"amount":591.81,"local_amount":4085.6,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:18:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4089.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624227009},{"amount":608.35,"local_amount":4199.71,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4203.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214185},{"amount":626.21,"local_amount":4323.05,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4326.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564308},{"amount":1988.37,"local_amount":13726.92,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":13739.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046280}],"funded_date":"2015-01-24T14:56:05Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:10:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eloise Phipps","image":null}},{"id":829964,"name":"Th\u00e1i","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Th\u00e1i works in agriculture, farming poultry and\u00a0cattle.

They have 3 children ages 2 ,4 and 7. Her occupation is the sale of jello and traditional pastries. \r\n\r\nShe is entrepreneurial, independent, sociable, charming, responsible and hardworking. She developed her business in the \"Plan 300\" area, which is characterized by its enormous population growth. Miners who relocated from the west of the country and indigenous groups from the region, such as the Ayoreos, have been moving to the area. The most recent generations primarily work in commerce and manufacturing. The region has a warm, tropical, humid climate, with daytime temperatures varying between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade.\r\n \r\nIsabel is short, has olive skin and long black hair. Her mother tongue is Guarani, which is spoken in the region. She also speaks Spanish because of her education and occupation. In the photo, she is sitting in the middle, wearing a red blouse and black pants. She shares her life with her partner, who is a construction worker, and with her children. Her oldest son is in school and she still fully takes care of her other two children. They live in a rented brick home with a corrugated iron roof. They have drinking water, electricity and are connected to the sewage network. Due to her desire to get ahead, she ended up leading a community bank. The bank's members have businesses such as the sale of furniture, the sale of quilts, the manufacturing of leather bags, the sale of meat pies, dressmaking, transportation services and video stores. The purpose of the members is to obtain loans and achieve their goals. \r\n\r\nIsabel's business is making and selling jello and traditional pastries. Some of her products are jello of different flavors in disposable plastic cups, pastries, cu\u00f1ap\u00e9 (small bun make of yucca flour and cheese), rice empanadas (baked pocket filled with rice and cheese), zonzo (yucca pur\u00e9e mixed with cheese baked or roasted in a stick shape), fried cheese empanadas (thin wheat flour dough mixed with cheese and fried in oil served with sprinkled sugar on top), and jigote empanadas (fried thin wheat flour dough filled with a mix of beef or chicken and vegetables). \r\n\r\nShe sells her products during the day and prepares the baking goods in the evening and on weekends. \"Jello is very nice on our warm days and it comes with a pastry\", she says. Her dream is to open a small restaurant to sell breakfasts and lunches. She would like to expand her business by purchasing a refrigerator and flour by the quintal, to be able to make her ingredients durable and to have enough flour for large orders (due to the season). This is the association's first loan cycle in the year that it has existed. This is why Isabel is requesting a loan to buy a refrigerator and flour by the quintal to satisfy the season's demand. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":1767852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a refrigerator and flour by the quintal to meet the current demand.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-01-20T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-19T06:50:01Z","loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcos Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Jhoselin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1561.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1583.9},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1606.45},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1629.32},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1652.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1676.02},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1699.89},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1724.08},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1748.61},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1773.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1776.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1841.02},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1850.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1876.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.91},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.18},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.79},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.9},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":271.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1405.91,"local_amount":9709.88,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":9714.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624227011},{"amount":495.76,"local_amount":3423.97,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3425.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214187},{"amount":1573.33,"local_amount":10866.15,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":10871.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564310}],"funded_date":"2015-02-05T18:44:20Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:30:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sergio Echeverri","image":null}},{"id":829980,"name":"Felipe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felipe is a 58-year-old married man and a father of five grown children from San Miguel, Bohol.

She lives with her partner and has three children who are 9, 6 and 3 years old. Her business is the sale of sweets. Mariza is sociable, kind, entrepreneurial, independent, responsible and hardworking. She runs her business in the \"plan 3000\" zone, an area characterized by its gigantic population growth. Miners who have relocated from the west and ethnic peoples like the Ayoreos, who are natives of the area, have established themselves. All around this area, the majority of the next generation works in sales and manufacturing. The climate is hot, tropical and humid, with a temperature that varies during the day between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nMariza has a tan complexion, long dark updone hair and is small of stature. ([In the photo] she is in the center in a black shirt and bright blue jeans with a black fannypack and holding a notebook in her hand). Her native language is Guaran\u00ed which is spoken in this area, and she speaks Spanish in everyday life and in her business. \r\n\r\nShe share sher life with her partner who also is in sales, and with her children. The oldest is studying in school and the younger ones are still in their mother's care. They live in a rented home built of brick with a corrugated iron roof and drinkable water, electricty and a septic system. \r\n\r\nHer desire to get ahead motivated her to lead a communal bank of people to take out a loan and achieve their dreams. Their businesses are: neighborhood store and butcher, sewing, fish sales, empanada sales, construction services, cosmetic sales, and the sale of seasonal clothing.\r\n\r\nMariza is in the business of making and selling candy. The artisan candy she prepares are also of good nutritional value because not only do her candies taste enjoyable; they also provide daily nutrition through the adequate amount of calories, the flavor and color of the fruit from which they are made, mild acidity, and pleasant consistency, appearance and smell. Mariza says \"the preparation of artisan candies has a relatively recent origin. At first they were very amateur, but now we follow processes and procedures that are almost industrial\".\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth series of loans with this institution in the two years since she has been running this business independently. Mariza's dream is to have a small store. For these reasons Mariza requests a loan to purchase materials to prepare her artisan sweets in bulk. She would like to purchase raw materials such as: granulated sugar, citric acid, pectin, fruit, glass jars and plastic wrap, among other things.

They live in a rented house built of bricks which provides them with electricity and a water well. The need to provide for her family's financial requirements led her to set up a communal bank so that she could apply for a loan and expand her business activities. The other group members run businesses which include clothing manufacture, transport services, video shop, crockery sales, cell phone sales, poultry meat sales, flower sales and a tea service. Mary's business involves selling vegetables, such as carrots, lettuces, broccoli, tomatoes, cayenne peppers and potatoes. She inherited this business from her mother and she has been running this business ever since she has had need for it.

Several years ago her husband passed away but from this relationship she had five children, of age and independent. Several years ago she learned cutting and sewing in an academy in the area.\r\n\r\nAreida is a very tenacious woman who, to get ahead, more than 32 years ago, put a sewing shop in her home alone. There she sewed all types of clothing for women, men and children. Although she knows that what she most likes to sew is clothing for women and children, she also has a small place in her house in which in the mornings she sells milk and cheese. She buys the milk and cheese from the cattle raisers of the area to later distribute it as retail or as wholesale to merchants to take it to other places to sell these products. This is how she gets ahead without depending on her children.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy milk, cheese and sewing materials. She has been in the credit group since it started and she likes it because of the help that the loans bring.

However, as she is aging, she is finding dairy farming to be challenging. She is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. Poultry farming is a less strenuous activity that is profitable.

He will use the capital to process more mobile airtime credits and utility bill payments transactions, especially on the weekends. In the near future, Ilham also plans to improve his sales in a new product from Ruma, which is an e-commerce application for remote communities called 'Mapan'. By serving Mapan to his customers, Ilham will be able to receive orders from customers who want to buy products that have been listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer orders, Ilham will simply send an SMS to an SMS center; the customer will pay him, and a Ruma agent will come to his stall to collect the money. Within 3-5 days, the product will be delivered right to the customer's door. With Mapan, Ilham believes that his community will have access to good quality products with better prices.

She resides in Lahore, Pakistan with her spouse and seven children. Her husband has been running his own tailoring shop in the local market for many years. He alone is responsible for meeting the financial needs of the entire family. Khursheed's husband needs to buy different types of tailoring accessories (e.g., pieces of cloth, needles, and sewing machine accessories). But due to some financial constraints, he is not able to buy these items for his business. Therefore, Khursheed has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan, she will financially assist her husband to buy tailoring accessories to fulfil his business needs, so that he can earn a more profitable income. For this financial assistance Khursheed is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are many reasons why I am applying for a Kiva loan. First of all, it is because of my family\u2019s financial situation. There are nine members of my family: my grandparents, my parents, my two elder siblings, two younger siblings and me. We are a big and lucky family, because there are three generations in it! My parents work a lot to support our big family. My grandparents are pensioners, and my grandmother is a disabled person of the second group, who often needs special treatment in a hospital and sanatorium. We love our grandparents - they are the story-tellers, who don\u2019t make us worried or upset but instead tell stories about the older generations and give advice on how to act in difficult times. Thanks to them we know the love of old people and what it is to be an old person.\r\n\r\nThe second reason for this loan is because I believe that AUCA will play the role of a ladder for me, which will enable me to climb up towards the peak of my aims. Not only is AUCA one of the top universities in the region, it is an educational bridge between east and west. With the knowledge and a degree from AUCA, one can easily compete in the job market, as well as pursue graduate studies in the west. My advice to AUCA students who would like to pursue graduate studies - take full advantage of the facilities and opportunities there. Also, for those who want to do an MBA, economics or finance programs - work hard on your math skills so you can score high on the GMAT or GRE tests.\r\n\r\nI am full of plans for the next four years and will do my best to realize them.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1740505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher

Following customer demand, he wants to offer juices, soft drinks, cold drinks, etc. He does not want to refuse any product and disappoint any of his respected customers. He wants to offer all those products which are necessary and consumable during one's daily routine. In this way, he will successfully win the trust of his customers and increase his income as well. \r\n\r\nTherefore Farzana requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband could buy cigarettes, pans, juices, soft drinks, cold drinks, etc. for his shop.

He wants to buy new revolving chairs and plastic furniture for his salon but his financial condition does not allow him to do this. Due to his low purchasing power, Razia requested a loan so that her son can easily buy new revolving chairs and plastic furniture for his salon. Razia hopes that this loan will work positively and she will be able to make some savings to spend on household expenses. Razia thanks Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

balanced, bright and stable future. \r\n\r\nI am very fortunate to have this opportunity to mobilize some resources through Kiva, and I greatly appreciate lenders\u2019 trust in me and their help.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1796100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

The water that is used for drinking and cooking is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases. Alice is a friendly member of the community, and has been elected Promoter by her village to help its members obtain safe drinking water.\n\nAs a volunteer Promoter, Alice represents the community on Kiva\u2019s website and educates the community on how to protect their families from unsafe drinking water by using a chlorine dispenser system. Alice and 2 other promoters in her community need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Alice wants to be a promoter because she believes that the chlorine will make the water safe for drinking, thus alleviating water-borne diseases.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Alice\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1794534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To provide communities with free access to chlorine to treat their drinking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2015-01-20T16:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-19T16:10:04Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carrilus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milicent","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1350,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-20T21:30:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":830049,"name":"Haneefan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Haneefan is 47 years old and married with four children.

The community of Kawigawiga village collects their drinking water from Aora Odundu because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Kawigawiga\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. In Kawigawiga, 25 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser.  Samson has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are 4 other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan:namely Siprose, Grace, Susan, and Maurice.\n\nKawigawiga village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser.

James and two other promoters in his community, including Eunice and Christine, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. James will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. James wants to be a promoter because he believes that the chlorine prevents waterborne diseases.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that James\u2019 community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1797520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"\"To install and maintain chlorine dispensers to provide access to safe drinking water for the community \"","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2015-01-20T16:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-19T16:10:05Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1350,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-22T17:47:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":828485,"name":"Charles' Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles is 48 years old, has 8 children, and lives in Aora Chuodho B village in Ndhiwa sub county, Kenya.

The community of Bogesia B village collects their drinking water from a local well because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Bogesia B\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser program offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. Bogesia B community will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Catherine has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water in order to keep themselves and their families healthy. There are 3 other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Susan, Joseph and Margret. \n\nBogesia B community needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Catherine believes that using the chlorine dispenser will reduce the number of reported cases of water-borne diseases, thus enabling the community to be healthy and active. \n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Catherine\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1798533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To improve health and productivity by increasing access to safe drinking water through chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2015-01-20T16:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-19T16:10:06Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-22T15:33:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":828434,"name":"Vision High School","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Uganda!
