Upon arrival she started working for a family as a live-in maid, and after several years and unfulfilled dreams of progress she decided to rent a location to set up an eatery. She was following the advice of her sister, who works in the production and sale of food.

Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. \r\n\r\nA good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also be protected from diseases that may arise from being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Bornice believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will also save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit. \r\n\r\nBornice hopes to have your support to improve her quality of life and that of her children!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":297.73,"image":{"id":1798301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To build a modern dairy unit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-20T20:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-19T20:10:07Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.87,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bornice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.82,"local_amount":3802.22,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3828.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601180},{"amount":41.14,"local_amount":3739.88,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3766.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459614},{"amount":39.18,"local_amount":3593.73,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3618.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.35,"payment_id":681378051},{"amount":42.66,"local_amount":3939.91,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3967.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.68,"payment_id":696587706},{"amount":42.91,"local_amount":4081.4,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4109.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.99,"payment_id":711506029},{"amount":42.69,"local_amount":3978.44,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4006.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.07,"payment_id":731022836},{"amount":42.46,"local_amount":3931.18,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3958.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.78,"payment_id":752111031}],"funded_date":"2015-01-21T05:04:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Ingram","image":566975}},{"id":830121,"name":"Najeb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Najeb is a 33-year-old married man with nine children.

man.  He lives with his beautiful family in the community of Solol\u00e1.  <br \/><br \/>Diego is an older gentleman who still enjoys working in agriculture.  His work gives him renewed energy.  The community where he lives experiences very warm weather, which makes it a place for harvesting the best onions.  <br \/><br \/>With the loans Diego has obtained, he has been able to increase his plantings.  He wants to plant more because he has the land to do this, but one of his difficulties is that he does not have sufficient operating capital.  For this reason, he is requesting another loan so that he can maintain the crops he has already planted.

From the age of 14 she went to school in the morning, did her homework in the afternoon and sometimes went out to play with her friends. But at night she had to help her mother at the restaurant. \r\n\r\nNow this young woman with an entrepreneurial spirit is 22 years old and is the single mom of a four-year-old boy. Fortunately, her mother passed down this business to her which has enabled her to support her small family. As the years go by, this merchant's desire to excel continues to grow. She has added dairy products to her business to diversify her food stand.

She owns a small farm in Kiburion, which is situated in the Rift Valley Province of Kenya. With the help of her husband, she also raises poultry and grows maize, among other crops. She also has a couple of small businesses on the side to make extra money.\r\n<p>\r\nThe income Caroline makes from farming, however, is not sufficient to sustain her family comfortably. As a result she is seeking a 40,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to build a cowshed. She has plans for a well-designed barn that will provide a clean, comfortable home for her herd and a pleasant, efficient workplace for her. The plans provide for the storage and handling of milk, feed, bedding and manure, as these elements account for most of the labor in any dairy farm. The housing will have a plentiful, dependable supply of good water, made available 24 hours a day. \r\n<p>\r\nOverall, Caroline feels these steps will result in increased milk production. The income she will make from this investment will put her in a position to comfortably afford increasing farming costs. Her family also stands to benefit from the growth of her business.\r\n<p>\r\nThe farming sector accounts for 45% of Kenya's gross domestic product, generates about 70% of Kenya\u2019s export revenue, and employs approximately 60% of Kenyans. Despite the importance of farming to Kenya and its economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations. \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason, farmers in Kenya remain under served by financial institutions. Juhudi Kilimo is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Kenyan farmers.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":255.94,"image":{"id":1798418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To build a cow shed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-21T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-20T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.25,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2998},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3082.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3564.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3890.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.76,"local_amount":6734,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6935.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601182},{"amount":34.48,"local_amount":3092.61,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3185.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.31,"payment_id":681378053},{"amount":69.05,"local_amount":6234.76,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6421.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.09,"payment_id":696587708},{"amount":73.4,"local_amount":6689.1,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":6888.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.85,"payment_id":731022838}],"funded_date":"2015-01-24T11:03:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Pierce","image":518671}},{"id":830204,"name":"Saleh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saleh is a 31-year-old, married man and a father of two children, living with them in Sana'a city, Yemen.

He also farms plantain and maize, which he sells to local market women in the village. The dry cocoa beans are sold to purchasing clerks who are also in the village. According to Isaac, his parents introduced him to farming because there was not enough money to provide for his education. \r\n\r\nIsaac participated in community education within his village on reducing deforestation, clean cook stoves, and indoor and outdoor air pollution. Isaac and his group members decided to resort to the use of the Elsa Clean Cook Stove to replace the use of wood fuel in their 3-stove open fire stove to improve their health and save the trees within the forests of their village. Isaac needs micro-loan assistance to be able to purchase the stove. He is grateful to all his micro-lenders for saving him from traveling a long distance in search of firewood for cooking and for protecting the forest within his village.

He works very hard at his job and has never missed a day. His income is barely able to feed his large family and each day is a continuous struggle. \r\n\r\nYoussef is worried about his home's uncomfortable living conditions since the ceiling has cracks due to the humidity, which lets the house fill with rain water.\r\n\r\nDue to this, Youssef is requesting a loan from Kiva's field partner, Al Majmoua, in order to make the necessary repairs to his house's rooftop - especially for the current winter season since it is filling with rain.\r\n \r\nHe is certain that these changes will significantly improve his family's living situation. His previous loan from Al Majmoua was invested in making necessary repairs to his car and to develop his business properly.\r\n \r\nHis dream is to one day earn enough money in order to improve his family's living condition and provide them with the best education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1798489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to provide the necessary maintenance to his house's rooftop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Qana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2015-01-21T08:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-20T08:10:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Refugee"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Youssef","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624151795},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636138459},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649775966},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665265515},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681271643},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:23:27Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696481539},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711389955},{"amount":625,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730913503}],"funded_date":"2015-02-05T17:17:22Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T12:24:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lavender","image":1304534}},{"id":829724,"name":"Las Esmeraldas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Esta es la Alcanc\u00eda Comunal \u201cLas Esmeraldas\u201d y  la conforman  08 socias trabajadoras y solidarias.

The group is comprised of three unique women whose work varies between services and food production and sales. Two of them are married with children, while the third is a widowed mother. All of the women have been neighbors and best friends for many years and have come to rely on each other significantly. \r\n\r\nAmal is a widowed mother of one child. Her child is enrolled in a private school, so she works hard to make sure she can afford educational fees. Amal's work is mainly based on food production and sales.  She works from home conserving certain vegetables and fruits from one season to another, in addition to preparing delicious homemade jams. In addition to this, she prepares hand made souvenirs and special occasions themes and gifts to ensure that she can expand her family's living and cover their increasing living needs.  Amal participates in several exhibitions, to market her productions and improve her business.\r\n\r\nShe resorted to these businesses in 2007 after her husband passed away so that she could fend for her child and take him to school. She does all this single handedly. She will use the loan which she is acquiring from Kiva's field partner Al Majmoua, to increase her business merchandise with special season production and newly released special occasions themes. Her main customers are neighbors and exhibition visitors. The main challenge is to compete with competitors from nearby villages. Sometimes she or her child might fall sick and on those days she is unable to work so she makes sure to work hard as much as she can when she is in good health to make sure that she can rest when she feels tired. Despite all the challenges, Amal is very hard working and determined to change her future and that of her child by giving him a good education.\r\n\r\nAmal is the first lady at the far left side of the picture. As for the other group members, Heba (sitting in the middle in pink) is a married mother of one child, who has been employed in a research company for three years, and her acquired loan will be invested in paying for her child's school tuition fees. Fadia is the lady at the far right side of the picture.  She is a married mother of one child, who has been working as a tailor from her house for twenty years. Her acquired loan will be invested in renewing her tailoring machine.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1806,"image":{"id":1798466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To increase her business merchandise with special season production and new released special occasions themes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Aley","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2015-01-21T10:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-20T10:50:01Z","loan_amount":2400,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Heba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":222},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":198}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":222,"local_amount":222,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":222,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624151794},{"amount":198,"local_amount":198,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":198,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636138458},{"amount":198,"local_amount":198,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":198,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649775965},{"amount":198,"local_amount":198,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":198,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665265514},{"amount":198,"local_amount":198,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":198,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681271642},{"amount":198,"local_amount":198,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:23:27Z","rounded_local_amount":198,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696481538},{"amount":198,"local_amount":198,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":198,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711389954},{"amount":198,"local_amount":198,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":198,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730913502},{"amount":198,"local_amount":198,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":198,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752004481}],"funded_date":"2015-02-17T21:42:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maadhavi Ramanayake","image":null}},{"id":830267,"name":"Kuuga Na Gwika Women Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent with two children, Minnie (who is holding a passbook in the photo) is 27 years old and works hard to support her family.

His gross monthly income is around 10,000 som from his pension and sales of milk and livestock.  This money isn't enough for a decent life, so to further develop his farm, he's requested a loan in the amount of 20,000 som to go towards a purchase of sheep.  He plans on using his extra income due to the loan to expand his farm and increase his family's income. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1795901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"buy additional sheep for fattening and resale in order to increase his profit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kaiyndy village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-01-21T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-20T17:10:05Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.91,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabyrbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1502},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1470},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1511},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1552},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1595},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1639},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1684},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1730},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1778},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1827},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1877},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1835}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.29},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.73},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.16},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.28},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.85},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.29,"local_amount":1502,"processed_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1574.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610751728},{"amount":25.73,"local_amount":1470,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624799468},{"amount":26.44,"local_amount":1511,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1583.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636161615},{"amount":27.16,"local_amount":1552,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1626.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513996},{"amount":27.91,"local_amount":1595,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995772},{"amount":28.68,"local_amount":1639,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:51:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1718.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291177},{"amount":29.47,"local_amount":1684,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1765.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500399},{"amount":29.72,"local_amount":1730,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1813.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.56,"payment_id":711411348},{"amount":29.9,"local_amount":1778,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:58:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1863.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.21,"payment_id":730933600},{"amount":88.79,"local_amount":5539,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5806.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.14,"payment_id":752025621}],"funded_date":"2015-01-27T22:55:38Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:04:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":830458,"name":"Adelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adelia needs a $ 600.00 loan  to improve her business.

She is a very hard-fighting woman, who in order to get ahead, works in several activities. She has a small snacks factory; she sells fabrics, perfumes and pomades and on the week ends she prepares and sells \"tongas\" (local cuisine). She prepares this food by request every weekend and she always has requests since her \"tongas\" are delicious. She prepares snacks with the help of two people who she pays a weekly income and her grandson is responsible for making deliveries to diners and stores in the area. She has been involved in this business for over 12 years and it has allowed her to move ahead. \r\n\r\nThis loan will allow her to purchase fabrics, perfumes, plantains, butter and food supplies for making snacks and other foods.

She tells us that her biggest challenge is to establish a successful business in the Dominican Republic. Andremena is very excited to be receiving her 15th loan from Esperanza Internacional, and will invest it in her business, which she has had for around 10 years. She is planning to invest her loan in buying various items of new clothing and a packet of used clothing whose items she will then sell individually. She will use her profits to re-invest in her business and to provide any need her family has.

She has been working in animal husbandry and agriculture for 15 years as the primary source of income for her family.

Margalita wants to generate more income for her family's welfare and start an additional activity. As the business she plans to start will be the only one in this area and the demand will be high, Margarita requested a loan to start it. Margalita requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for starting a manufacturing business startup but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time, because the creditors did not find the existing family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. Margarita's loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start up loan program provides start up credit soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who, regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, do not have access to credit products. With the received credit, Margalita will purchase all merchandise and tools for a wood workshop and will open locally. Her husband will help her for leading the new business. They will get private orders and will make good profits.

The nearby villages also suffer from dirty and unsafe drinking water.    \r\n\r\nKhun is excited that she, like her group members, was able to purchase a water filter.  Most families report a threefold reduction in diarrhea after they begin using the filter; because the filter removes bacteria and other water borne diseases.  The water filter also increases disposable income to users like Khun due to the decreased cost of purchasing charcoal, decreased time spent foraging for wood, and by decreasing the amount of money used to purchase bottled water.  The filter is guaranteed for 2 years, though most find the filter works for 3-5
