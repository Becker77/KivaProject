Her husband, a fisherman, died after 5 years of their marriage, leaving all her 4 little children with her to raise and look after. When her husband\u2019s death, she started working as a helper in the fish port where she cleans up scattered empty fish tubs.  With the little money she earned, she made it a point to save until she was able to set up a small capital for her to sell fish. \n\nShe wakes up at 3:00 AM buying fish on the fish port and selling it on the wet market stall she rented and goes home by 10:00 PM. Her hard work in fish vending helped all her children to graduate in college.  Ideally, Benita could already retire from working. However, Benita says that she does not want to burden her children with her needs and that she is still strong and capable to work. \n\nShe came to know of SEED on January 2014 through a friend who is also a member of SEED. Her first loan amounting to PhP 10,000 gave her enough capital to buy variety of fishes to include talakitok (cavalla), tilapia (St. Peter\u2019s fish), bangus (milk fish), dalagang bukid (yellow tail fusilier). This increased her net income from PhP 1,500 a day to PhP 3,000 - 4,000 a day.  From then on, Benita\u2019s business greatly improved. \n\nOn her 4th loan now, she\u2019s now asking for a re-loan amounting to PhP 30,000  to buy other seafood items such squid, shrimps, and crabs and sets of fish tubs and ice boxes which will be used for her 2nd rented fish stall.\n\nAside from securing her own needs, Benita also sees this as an opportunity to help other poor but hardworking individuals in their community.

The Group is led by the 65 year-old farmer Haji Asan, who is standing far left and wear a religious fez at his head. The other farmers in the group are Maysun, Sansan, Zizi, Joni, Cemin, Rimanep, Umi, Mahnun, Misdawi and Kemal. All of them live in Embung Ganang, a small village in East Lombok District, Lombok Island, Indonesia. Haji Asan has a family with three children. He also is a figure of religious and community leader in his village. \n\nHaji Asan has high hopes for his family and he strives to improve his economic conditions. A few years ago, with a minimum investment, he bought some beef-cattle which he fattened for resale. He also operates a small-scale vegetable farming. His business is going well so far. He was concerned to see many of the poor farmers in his village. So, he invited ten of his fellow farmers to establish a farmer group to develop their business and sharing advantages. However, he also concerned to see the cow dung was wasted without further processing and it started to pollute the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nAfter socialized by YRE and Yayasan Mitra Membangun Masyarakat Sejahtera\/YM3S (a local foundation \u2013 biogas construction partner of Yayasan Rumah Energi) about Household Biogas (BIRU) program, Haji Asan saw an opportunity to reduce his dependence on non- renewable cooking gas. In addition, he also wants to use bio-slurry (biogas residue) as organic fertilizer. It will increase his family revenue. It seems like the biogas program would be the best solution for his problem. Haji Asan is keen to purchase a bio-digester, but he does not have sufficient capital for it. A loan from Kiva will help him and other farmer group members to make it possible.\n\nHe have an optimism that if he can build bio-digester, he can use the bio-gas for cooking, and bio-slurry (biogas residue) as fertilizer for his plantation. He also hopes that in the future, he can invite the whole farmers in his village to use biogas and also establish bio-slurry related business to create a new job opportunity to his surrounding neighborhood.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1466.67,"image":{"id":1798176,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion","Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to build bio-digester and use the bio-slurry (biogas residue) as organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Lombok Timur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":423,"posted_date":"2015-01-21T20:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-20T20:50:18Z","loan_amount":4400,"lender_count":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haji Asan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maysun","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sansan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cemin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rimanep","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Kemal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Umi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mahnun","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Misdawi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zizi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":55000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":4400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":9166666},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9166667},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":9166667},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":9166667},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9166667},{"due_date":"2016-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9166666}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":733.34},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":733.34},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":733.33,"local_amount":9166666,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:44:13Z","rounded_local_amount":9211690.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636499225},{"amount":733.34,"local_amount":9166667,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:59:48Z","rounded_local_amount":9211691.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696770817}],"funded_date":"2015-01-26T13:16:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":830492,"name":"Danilo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Danilo is 53 years old and a fish vendor.

He lives in Kyotera, a  small town in Central Uganda. Emma studied at the Kammengo Institute to become a technician. Afterwards he joined a distribution company, Dembe Traded Enterprises, that sells big home solar systems. There he worked as a solar technician for two years.\r\n\r\nEmma always planned to become an independent entrepreneur and saved his earnings to collect enough capital to start his own business.  After two years working as a solar technician, he had saved enough to make his dream come true: he started Solar Home Systems, his company that is selling big solar systems as well as pico solar systems (solar lanterns). Emma employs a secretary and technicians in his business, which he has been running successfully and continuously growing for seven years now.  \r\n\r\nDealing with energy-efficient products, Emma wanted to sell energy-efficient stoves as well and became an UpEnergy distribution partner three years ago.  When he is installing his solar systems for his customers, he travels into deeply rural areas, where people are in need of energy-efficient cooking methods as well and thus he also provides his clients with energy-efficient cooking stoves. Emma aims to scale up his stove business, but transportation, logistics and capital limitations are challenges he is facing. Investing all the money in inventory, he is not able to afford better transportation methods, which would help him to sell more. So far he has hired a van, which raises his costs and reduces the capital available for useful investments. Furthermore Emma cannot stock as many stoves as people demand because of high upfront costs. Another obstacle for selling more stoves is that he cannot sell them from his shop because he does not own a space to display and store the stoves safely. \r\n\r\nWith the help of the Kiva loan, Emma will be able to receive and stock enough inventory for one month. He will pay back the inventory he received one month later from the revenues from the sales of the energy-efficient stoves. This procedure will repeat monthly. Furthermore he will purchase a tricycle to be able to transport more stoves in a cost effective way to his customers in rural areas. One time a month, he will also do a special sales trip in the region and rent a truck and a public announcement system, to promote and sell stoves. The Kiva loan will provide a way to lease the truck and speaker system six times. After these six months, Emma will be able to afford the lease fees from his, by then generated, savings. The Kiva loan will also be used to buy a secure storage area so that Emma can display, sell and store stoves in front of his shop. \r\n\r\nFor him, the benefit of working with UpEnergy is getting an interest free loan, which is a precondition to scale up. Furthermore, the fact that UpEnergy provides genuine, high quality energy-efficient products that people appreciate and that improve people\u2019s life, creates a  good reputation for him and his his business.\r\n\r\nFor Emma, the biggest benefit of using energy-efficient stoves is that people save money and time.  In his community, he observes that people\u2019s lives improve because they have more money. Also deforestation is reduced considerably, which is important to mitigate climate change and to, thus, reduce the threat of drought.\r\n\r\nHe dreams about scaling up his shop, to be able to have a good life, meaning he can afford a good school for his child and medical treatment for his family.

To build her business network, she became a member of a small group of fellow smallholder farmers who empower each other to become better entrepreneurs. \n\nFaith is seeking a loan to buy animal feed and a chaff cutting machine. The financial benefits she will reap from the loan are almost immediate. The machine will cleanly and evenly chop hay into suitable sizes for cows to eat and digest easily. \n\nFrom her loan appraisal, Faith is disciplined with money - She updates her budget on a monthly basis, tracks every income and expense and approaches new business opportunities eagerly."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":559.66,"image":{"id":1794678,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Meet David. He is a 28-year-old farmer from Kipsaiya village, situated in the Rift valley province of Kenya. He lives together with his wife and four children on a small piece of land where he keeps dairy cows, poultry and grows a wide variety of crops. For ten years, his primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and horticultural produce. \r\n\r\nDavid's biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals to prevent these diseases. David made a decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help him improve his farming activities. Sometime last month, he applied for a loan for expanding his horticulture farm. This will enable him to expand his operations to increase the overall output. \r\n\r\nThe additional income from the expansion will go to David's children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is increasingly becoming prohibitive for low-income communities, especially in the rural areas. As a result, kids are forced to drop out and start working to contribute their earnings to their families. With your loan, David's children will acquire quality education that will act as a strong foundation for their bright future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":183.45,"image":{"id":1791668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To expand his horticulture farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-21T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-20T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.53,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.37,"local_amount":1810.33,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1864.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824798},{"amount":19.37,"local_amount":1721.57,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1773.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262760},{"amount":19.34,"local_amount":1718.72,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1770.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264959},{"amount":19.25,"local_amount":1711.48,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1763.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601130},{"amount":20.75,"local_amount":1844.36,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1899.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459590},{"amount":20.4,"local_amount":1829.26,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1884.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.18,"payment_id":681378006},{"amount":21.54,"local_amount":1944.57,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2003.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.34,"payment_id":696587673},{"amount":40.9,"local_amount":3725.49,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.01,"payment_id":731022804}],"funded_date":"2015-01-22T16:21:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":827783,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah lives in Kampala, Uganda.

Three times a week, her son travels to the fields to buy passion fruit, papayas, pineapples, and melons and then transports them by car to Quevedo, a place where small retailers sell their goods.  Dilia will also give part of her loan to her husband so that he can use it for his farming since the winter planting season is approaching.  This will allow both of them to forge ahead by working honorably each day.  <br \/><br \/>This loan will be used to buy pineapples, passion fruit, and seeds for farming.  Dilia is a founding member of her Communal Bank and enjoys the benefits that being in a group has offered.  Her dreams include buying a truck since the car that she owns is small."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1796737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy pineapples, passion fruit, and seeds for her husband's farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2015-01-21T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-20T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilia Maydita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1630.03,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":135.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":135.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":135.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":135.84},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":135.84},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":135.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":135.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":135.84},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.84},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":135.84},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":135.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":135.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275.02,"local_amount":271.68,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":275.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611785818},{"amount":275.02,"local_amount":271.68,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":275.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624232439},{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":271.68,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":275.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636218182},{"amount":275,"local_amount":271.68,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649569828},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":407.52,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:20:02Z","rounded_local_amount":412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665050416},{"amount":137.45,"local_amount":135.79,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:51:51Z","rounded_local_amount":137.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681348285}],"funded_date":"2015-01-25T10:55:46Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:51:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":830621,"name":"Julie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julie is a 33-year-old married mother of two children from Dulag, Leyte.

Meet Theresa, an ever-smiling young farmer who is responsible and has had to overcome many difficulties through her life. However, she has always found the strength to move forward and to keep growing in her life. She has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture.\r\n\r\nShe is the proud owner of a small parcel of land, on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years. Her primary sources of income are selling eggs and milk, and through this venture she has earned a decent income. She also engages in personal business in order to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nTheresa passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cows. Although this humble mum has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. \r\n\r\nTheresa is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. With the loan capital, she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 litres of milk a day. This will help to fully satisfy the demand. Through Juhudi Kilimo, which is a field partner, she attended training sessions and was taught the best financial management skills.

The major cash crop grown in the Thika area is potatoes, and that is why this region is nicknamed \u201cpotatoes region\u201d. Charles is a caring father and has been farming for the past 10 years. Through farming, he has been able to take care of his children and family. Charles also does business so that he can make ends meet and increase his profit levels. Through these ventures, he has always brought food home and earned an honest living. He is a very hardworking man, and sells milk and his produce in the market and to his neighbors so that he is able to make more money. \r\n\r\nOne challenge that he is currently facing involves getting his products to the market on time. Because of the poor road network and poor feeder roads, the products are no longer fresh when they reach the market. This means that Charles must sell them at a throw-away price, hence not getting maximum profit. Products such as milk, fruits, and vegetables require a timely delivery to market and, for this reason, Charles is seeking a loan of KES 40,000 to buy a motorbike that will assist him in getting his products to market faster. He is sure of reaping more profit because his products will be fresh and will fetch more money. With improved profits, Charles will be able to assure his children of a brighter future and improve his living conditions. Having gone through and understood the repayment schedule, he is sure that he will be able to repay the loan on time and increase his business in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":374.52,"image":{"id":1797561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

However, he has always had the strength to overcome it and move forward with his six lovely children. Stephen is a smallholder farmer based in Nkubu, which is an agricultural center near the famous Mount Kenya (the second highest in Arica). He owns a small piece of land together with his lovely 47-year-old beautiful wife, and they have been blessed with six children. On the land, they have kept dairy cattle and grown vegetables for 20 years. Their main income sources are milk and crops. They recently ventured into a \u201csmall side hustle\u201d to supplement the meager income they earn through farming. From Kiva lenders, Stephen is seeking a loan worth KES 20,000 to grow his horticulture business. \n\nHorticultural produce and processed products is becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident from the steadily rising exports. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to provide Stephen with access to a loan facility that will assist him to grow her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Stephen\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability.\n\nLenders, kindly support this enterprising man with a loan!\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":185.29,"image":{"id":1795928,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To grow his horticulture business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-21T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-20T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.69,"local_amount":3350.45,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3451.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262789},{"amount":36.64,"local_amount":3256.83,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3354.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601172},{"amount":13.72,"local_amount":1230.24,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1267.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.12,"payment_id":681378043},{"amount":17.82,"local_amount":1609.01,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1657.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"payment_id":696587701},{"amount":18.52,"local_amount":1722.42,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1774.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.86,"payment_id":711506021},{"amount":16.76,"local_amount":1526.83,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1572.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.42,"payment_id":731022831},{"amount":41.7,"local_amount":3773.96,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3887.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.76,"payment_id":752111023}],"funded_date":"2015-01-25T02:05:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":830627,"name":"Clementine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clementine is 33 years old.

members were born and live in the Chozvo area. The group sells its crop at a fair price to Empresa de Comercializa\u00e7\u00e3o Agricola Lda (ECA), a local agribusiness which both acts as a buyer and provides the farmers with quality farming inputs and technical advice. An investment by AgDevCo has allowed ECA to purchase a state-of-the-art maize mill, designed for use in rural areas, so it can process the farmers\u2019 crop before selling it on. \n\nThe group in total farms 15.5 hectares of land. All farming is done manually. The farmers require finance to purchase vital farming inputs - all of them purchase seed and some choose to also purchase fertilizer. \n\nAccess to a group loan of 30,490 Meticais equates to an average of 2,541 Meticais (79 USD) per participant- enough for the farmers to purchase from ECA the inputs they need. Farming conditions in the area are extremely tough with only intermittent rainfall. However, since becoming participants on the Chozvo scheme all the farmers report life becoming easier. They can afford good quality fertilizer, which is purchased from ECA. The farmers\u2019 crops are also bought by ECA every week - they come to their farms so the participants do not need to walk long distances to find a market for their crops.

Seeing that his earnings are not enough to cover his household expenses, he started a business activity that he does during the time he has off from working as a day worker on other farms.

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI set a goal to study at AUCA a long time ago and my parents have always supported me in all my endeavors. I strongly believe that from my further education depend not only my career, but also my future life. I find AUCA a place, where I can get a good knowledge and skills that I can use in the future. The fact is that, the good education costs good\/much money, and my family isn\u2019t able to provide it.\r\n\r\nWe are six people in my family: my parents, me,  two younger sisters and my younger brother.  My sisters go to school and brother visit kindergarten. My both parents are public servants with the small salary, which is rarely enough for our daily necessities. As I am the eldest daughter, they try to give me everything, what will help me in this life, one of these important things is an education, but only the good one. Being well educated means for me a stable job, good salary, and friendly society, realizing plans and being able to help others.\r\n\r\nAs said above, my parent\u2019s salary is the only source of our income. Several months ago my father was fired from his old job and thanks to God, was able to find a new one, but with the less salary. \r\nI always wanted my parents be proud of me: I was a diligent student at school, visited training courses TOEFL to pass the entrance exams, participated in the \u201cBrain Ring\u201d competition in order to get a full scholarship at AUCA. Unfortunately, I was one of 12 finalists. Then I tried to get high scores at National Testing to study for free at AUCA, but was lack of 4 points, that disappointed me a lot. I think the last chance to pay for my AUCA tuition is to get a Kiva loan. And hope that this time I will be successful.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1799096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She has two children, ages nine and two.  Her business is a book store.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, independent, enterprising, patient, a good listener, supportive, responsible and hard-working.  She conducts her business in the El Torno area, a rural community that is a 45 minute car ride from the city.  It is known for its agricultural commerce, which gets together buyers from the city and sellers from the fields.  The place has a tropical climate with a constant temperature of 30 degrees centigrade all year.\r\n\r\nYolanda has a dark complexion, is short, and has long black hair.  Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and the business she does.  (She is standing and has on a pink blouse.)  She shares her life with her life partner, who works in transportation, and her children, who go to school.  They live in the family house that has well water and electricity.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling bookstore items like pencils, pens, notebooks, white paper, colored paper, rulers, and markers, etc.  She works all day from Monday through Saturday.  She devotes Sundays to her family by taking walks and cleaning house.\r\n\r\nHer bookstore has constant sales because it is close to a school.  Sales drop during vacations.  She uses this time to take inventory and replace needed materials.  \u201cDuring the school season the bookstore does not stop selling.  During vacations it is a little empty.  This is a good time to take inventory,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a chain of bookstores.  She wishes to stock her bookstore with school materials like books, school texts, stories, notebooks, and others.  She wants to do this in order to be prepared with the needed materials for the new school year.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan cycle with the institution in the first year that she has been engaged in this business activity.

The group in total farms 12.5 hectares of land. \n\nAll farming is done manually. The farmers require finance to purchase vital farming inputs - all of them purchase seed and some choose to also purchase fertilizer. \n\nAccess to a group loan of 21,590 Meticais (677 USD) equates to an average of 1,963 Meticais (62 USD) per participant- enough for the farmers to purchase from ECA the inputs they need. Farming conditions in the area are extremely tough with only intermittent rainfall. However, since becoming participants on the Chozvo scheme all the farmers report life becoming easier. They can afford good quality fertilizer, which is purchased from ECA. The farmers\u2019 crops are also bought by ECA every week - they come to their farms so the participants do not need to walk long distances to find a market for their crops. Since ECA\u2019s arrival into their community, and with access to funds to purchase the necessary inputs, the farmers have seen their yields and incomes increasing threefold. This is allowing them to invest in their farms, buy motorbikes and send their children to school.

She says that she joined ID Ghana seven years ago at the invitation of a family member who is a member of the institution. She explains that she started this business after seeing a mother who was selling these products and obtaining capital from ID Ghana to establish her own independent business. \n\nThe loan she will take now is to increase her capital for the purchase of more maize and groundnuts from a wholesaler, which she will acquire at the market in the city of Accra. She will then sell them in another small market. This way of working allows her to generate resources to invest back in her business. When asked what she likes about ID Ghana, she responds that she likes the savings and the institution's heath-related offerings.

The group sells its crop at a fair price to Empresa de Comercializa\u00e7\u00e3o Agricola Lda (ECA), a local agribusiness which both acts as a buyer and provides the farmers with quality farming inputs and technical advice. An investment by AgDevCo has allowed ECA to purchase a state-of-the-art maize mill, designed for use in rural areas, so it can process the farmers\u2019 crop before selling it on. \n\nThe group in total farms 11.5 hectares of land. All farming is done manually. \n\nThe farmers require finance to purchase vital farming inputs - all of them purchase seed and some choose to also purchase fertilizer. Access to a group loan of 21,250 Meticais (659 USD) equates to an average of 2,656 Meticais (82 USD) per participant- enough for the farmers to purchase from ECA the inputs they need. Farming conditions in the area are extremely tough with only intermittent rainfall. However, since becoming participants on the Chozvo scheme all the farmers report life becoming easier. They can afford good quality fertilizer, which is purchased from ECA. The farmers\u2019 crops are also bought by ECA every week - they come to their farms so the participants do not need to walk long distances to find a market for their crops. Since ECA\u2019s arrival into their community, and with access to funds to purchase the necessary inputs, the farmers have seen their yields and incomes increasing threefold. This is allowing them to invest in their farms, buy motorbikes and send their children to school.

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am applying for a Kiva loan, which, as a part of financial aid from AUCA, will help me to pursue a degree at AUCA. I believe that my good academic record and volunteer service work make me a good candidate for this loan. During my high school studies, I maintained a good level of academic achievement and also I have done volunteering service within my school. I was an active participant of a fundraising campaign for the support of orphaned and handicapped children. This commitment is very significant for me as it provides me with the incentive of being part of the support process, as well as helping me to grow personally in terms of moral ethics. \r\n\r\nAs the economy of Tajikistan is very weak and the unemployment rate is so high, salaries are so small. My family\u2019s total income is 4,020 USD per year, which is hardly enough to support five members of my family. This amount is the sum of my parent\u2019s income, an unbelievable sum for the other countries. We do not spend a lot of money on entertainment and don\u2019t allow extra stuff for ourselves; we just buy food and clothing and pay for medical expenses and utilities. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the difficult situation of my family, I need a Kiva loan. It is a great chance for me to put an end to the uncertainty and to start a new life after my university days.

They generate income from selling fruits and vegetables seasonally and also trading with dairy products. Tamari's husband also gets a salary of 400 GEL from another business. However, the family finds it hard to find financial stability and requested a loan for starting an additional business. \r\n\r\nTamari decided to go to Turkey with the requested loan amount and purchase stock of various home products and clothing at wholesale prices, and then sell in her community at increased prices.

She is married and 27 years old.  She lives in the community of Santo Tomas la Union.  She has two small children, 7 and 1.  \r\nWith the objective of supporting her husband with the household expenses, a year ago Lendi began selling food.  She does not do this every day, only two or three days a week.  She is a itinerant seller in the community market.  On the days when she is not selling, she washes clothes and does everything necessary to keep her house clean.\r\nLendi is a mother who loves her children dearly and cares for them so they don't get sick, but the problem is that she doesn't have a very appropriate bathroom where her children can bathe in order to be hygienic.\r\nSo with this necessity, she knocked on the doors of ADICLA to seek a loan which she could use for the construction of her bathroom.

This is Adnan, a specialized electrician who works hard to develop his talents and business to provide his family with the necessary standards of living. Adnan has been fixing and maintaining all types of household appliances and many other electronics since 1985. He is working hard to apply his previously acquired college knowledge to cope with the newly released technology in a smart way. He wants to make sure that his business will continue moving in parallel with the daily released technologies.\r\n\r\nWorking in a refugee camp is an obstacle on its own, so he has to work harder to expand his business since he is limited to the camp's citizens. Although he has a low income because of the limited access to the camp, he still had the chance to provide one of his children with a university degree in Math, and he is working hard to provide the others with the best education possible too. \r\n\r\nHis previously acquired loan from Kiva's field partner Al Majmoua was very successful in improving his business, so he is very anxious to acquire the current loan.

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me that my family\u2019s life consists in working only. We are seven in our family: my parents, elder three sisters, me and my younger brother. My eldest sister is married and has her own family. My other two sisters are the students at other local universities, and my brother is a school-boy. My parents are farmers and shepherds. We live in the village and have a yard, where we grow vegetables to feed ourselves. Besides, my parents are seasonal shepherds. They take other people\u2019s cattle and move to the mountains for summer, and come back in the beginning of fall, and for their service they earn additional money. In winters we make carpets at home, this work requires much effort and unhealthy, but we need to get money in order to struggle with this life. Thanks to all our attitude, we have money to live and pay for our daily necessities. We work, we earn some money, we spend it and then we work again, so such my family\u2019s situation bothers me and I want to change my life and the world around me.\r\n\r\nI chose this department, because I am good in Math from my school years. There are few girls in our Program as boys are more disposed to Math than girls, so I am happy to be one of these selected girls-students. I have big goals for the future; one of them is to continue my studies in Europe after receiving a Bachelor degree in AUCA, then opening a school for deep learning of Math in my village. I can contribute to my country\u2019s development by this way. And I need AUCA\u2019s education to achieve these goals.\r\n\r\nAs we know, Kiva changes lives for better, lives of those, who are so similar to me. Receiving Kiva loan means to me having a hope for the bright future and meeting new unknown, but kind and warm-hearted people.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1799187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

To progress in life and to generate more income, Maia has thought of becoming a hair stylist and has great desire to start working in the profession. \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan from a local financial institution.

Jafred also decided to purchase two solar lights as part of his loan, which he is very excited about, as it will allow him to have an overall improved quality of life.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Jafred's Group will be able to receive a total of ten solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 9 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1747418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase two solar lights and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-01-22T15:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-21T15:40:05Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jafred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lota W","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodah N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doricus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelide","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Athanas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ketiruta","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses K","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":137680,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137680}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Ingram","image":566975}},{"id":830788,"name":"Twiteganyirize Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"TWITEGANYIRIZE is a group led by Vicentie who is 53 years old.

He was born in Kitaingo village, which is situated in Eastern province of Kenya. He has seven siblings and grew up in a modest home, where his father worked as a teacher to put food on the table. Augustin's mom worked at home and supported the family. Through primary and secondary education, Augustine had to sacrifice going to boarding school in order to help his parents with menial work. For example, he worked in farming right after his secondary school national examination in order to raise funds for his college education.\r\n \r\nIn his freshman year of college at Tsavo Park Hotel Institute, Augustine found independence and a stronger sense of direction. He immediately enrolled for a certificate course in Commercial Management. The experience of being a student in this institution greatly defined him and lifted his interest in pursuing a diploma in Hotel and Catering Management.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, after the diploma, Augustine spent four years working in the hotel industry.During this time, the greatest challenges were the foreseeable lay-offs during off-peak seasons and fears of job insecurity brought about by the fact that hotel industry is very sensitive to changes in external environment, such as disease epidemics, terrorism, and travel advisories. For these reasons, Augustine decided to move his career away from hotels and closer to other businesses in the service industries.\r\n  \r\nIn 2006, he joined Cellucom Kenya Limited, a mobile phone services company. He worked under the Distribution Department as an office assistant. He later joined Zain Africa where he worked for five years as the head of the mailing room. His duties including handling all incoming and outgoing mail and invoices. From Zain Africa, Augustine's fate led him to a social enterprise whose mission is to elevate the quality of life of smallholder rural farmers, Juhudi Kilimo (Swahili for \"Effort in farming\").\r\n\r\nAugustine says that his job in Juhudi Kilimo is the most fulfilling of all the jobs he has held in his career. He gets a feeling of self-satisfaction from being an integral part of a growing organization that seeks to maximize social impact as well as to stay financially viable. From his many years of experience, he knows he has enough to bring to Juhudi\u2019s table to shape the organization\u2019s future and make it the leading microfinance organisation in East Africa. Also, from his years of experience, he has identified huge gaps in his knowledge and skills that need to be filled. Augustine believes in the Kiva process and mission so much that he applied for a loan to pay for a diploma course in business management.\r\n\r\nWith your faith and support, Augustine will be in a position to sharpen his business knowledge and skills in order to make the best out of his current post as an administrative assistant. He is a hard worker who is rich on ideas but poor on capital.  With your loan investment in his education, he will seize this timely opportunity of going back to school and reminding himself of one or two things about service delivery because, Augustine says, services do expire."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":393.36,"image":{"id":1799279,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mary\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 3.75 acres of land and purchase a total of seven solar lights.\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1747425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-01-22T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-21T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jafred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Millicent","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfayo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":67020,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67020}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-22T18:06:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Ingram","image":566975}},{"id":830771,"name":"Kpanmanga - Tamalgu Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ayi is a forty-year-old hard working woman from Tamalgu in the Northern region of Ghana.

From a very young age she liked being with her sister when she weaved. From the age of about 10, she started weaving and now she works making traditional clothing such as g\u00fcipiles (traditional blouses and dresses), and corsets of different kinds and sizes. She does this work from home and with the years of experience she has she is very much in demand and takes orders. However, with the little capital she has, she cannot buy enough raw materials.
