They have four children (ages 10, 9, 6, and 3).  She works as a manager at a racquetball club.  <br \/><br \/>Susan is a good mother who is independent, intelligent, responsible, and hardworking.  She goes to her job in the town of El Torno, a rural community that is located 45 minutes outside of the city by automobile.  This area is known for its agricultural trade.  Rural producers, vendors, and distributors gather in this town.  The weather is warm, tropical, and humid.  The temperature varies during the day between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade throughout the entire year.  <br \/><br \/>Susan has a dark complexion, long curly black hair, short stature, and dark eyes.  Her native language is Guaran\u00ed and she speaks it in her town.  However, she speaks Spanish to integrate herself into the general culture and to conduct her work.  In the photo, she is seated in the middle, wearing a brown tank top and denim shorts.  She shares her life with her partner who works in the transportation sector.  Her older children are in school and the youngest one is under her care.  They live in a rented brick house that has well water and electricity.  Her drive to succeed has resulted in her becoming the leader of a Communal Bank that includes people who operate the following types of businesses:  operating a sewing workshop, selling cosmetics, manufacturing mattresses, selling coats, selling aprons and wool, selling alpaca wool sweaters, selling traditional skirts, selling children\u2019s jackets, and managing a metalsmith shop.  By requesting a loan, the members will be able to expand their businesses.  <br \/><br \/>Susan\u2019s main job is operating and managing a racquetball club.  She works from 7:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M.  This gives her time to manage her side business.  Due to suggestions from friends and prospective customers, she decided to begin a business of selling brand-name cosmetics such as Yanbal, Revlon, Avon, and Natura.  These products include perfumes, cr\u00e8mes, eye pencils, lipsticks, and other items.  She works at this business from 3:00 P.M. onward.  \u201cThanks to having this available time, I\u2019ve always thought of having my own business.

Her youngest daughter is in school. Sayil has higher education, and worked many years as a school teacher. She has worked with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation since 2004. She has two cows and six sheep at the farm. In addition, Sayil has a plot of land of 4.0 hectares, where she grows clover for farm use and sale. \r\n\r\nThanks to Sayil's persistent work, her farm has around 10,000 som (KGS) per month, that serves as the basis for the cost of food and household needs of the family. This money is not enough for a decent life, and therefore Sayil turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase ten sheep with an aim to further develop her business. Sayil plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":690,"image":{"id":1797201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase ten sheep in order to increase her income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Kulzha village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-01-22T22:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-21T22:50:15Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.02,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Seyil","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3674},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3635},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3743},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3855},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3971},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4090},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4212},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4338},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4468},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4602},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4739},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4673}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.51},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.46,"local_amount":3674,"processed_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610751732},{"amount":61.8,"local_amount":3635,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3699.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624799475},{"amount":63.63,"local_amount":3743,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3809.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636161624},{"amount":65.53,"local_amount":3855,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3923.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649514004},{"amount":67.51,"local_amount":3971,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4041.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995779},{"amount":69.53,"local_amount":4090,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4162.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291187},{"amount":71.6,"local_amount":4212,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4287,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500406},{"amount":72.35,"local_amount":4338,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4415.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.4,"payment_id":711411355},{"amount":72.95,"local_amount":4468,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4547.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.01,"payment_id":730933608},{"amount":71.62,"local_amount":4602,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4683.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.61,"payment_id":752025629}],"funded_date":"2015-01-23T07:01:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":831138,"name":"Luiza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luiza, is a 22-year-old young woman from Tbilisi City.

Kenya\u2019s export revenue, and employs approximately 70% of Kenyans. Despite the importance of agriculture to Kenya and its economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Kenya remain underserved by financial institutions. Juhudi Kilimo is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Kenyan farmers. \r\n\r\nMeet Clara, an ever-smiling, hardworking and honest mother who is 22 years of age! She hails from the Kericho area of Kenya. She is the proud mother of two lovely, school-going children. She loves and treasures her children and will go the extra mile to make sure that they are comfortable. Clara\u2019s primary source of income has come from selling milk, crop farming, and poultry farming. Through these ventures, she has been able to earn a decent income. She is a very determined and dedicated farmer who has been farming for 10 years, and throughout she has never regretted going into farming. Although this humble mum has been making profits, not everything has been \u201ca bed of roses\". She faces financial challenges, and because the Kericho area has proven a ready market for cereals, she is kindly seeking a loan to buy cereal for resale and thus improve her income.\r\n\r\nClara\u2019s upbringing was challenging, and she has faced many economic problems.

Its economy is supported by tourism, since this canton has beach, city, and country areas. The city has three universities with campuses as well as two at a distance.\r\n\r\nIn this place lives Ingrid, who is 32 years old. She is separated and has 3 children, who are 13, 10, and 5 years old. They are in middle school, elementary school, and preschool. Ingrid has her own house, but at the moment she is living in a shelter because her house is in a danger zone.\r\n\r\nIngrid, with the hope of obtaining her own income and taking advantage of her knowledge of tailoring, set up a small sewing workshop at her house with a friend. There, she makes all kinds of clothing for women, men, and children. She admits that what she enjoys making most is articles of clothing for women and girls, since these have more designs and allow her to continue learning.

Meet Joseph. He is a 24 year-old farmer from Kithakanoro village in the Central province of Kenya. He owns three acres of land that he uses to keep two cows named Kathurima and Mutembeyi (vernacular for 'black' and 'brown' respectively). On the land, he also grows maize, vegetables and trees, and soon enough bananas.  \r\nJoseph has a great sense of direction since he started farming two years ago. He plans to keep diversifying his farm products so as to maintain a steady growth in income. \r\nJoseph is seeking a loan to grow bananas. The costs of starting banana farming has proven to be prohibitive even to those rural smallholder farmers with an existing cash flow: A lot of labor is required for banana seedbed preparation. With your loan, however, Joseph will have secured capital to get the banana farm going. \r\nHe will use income from milk sales to make initial payments towards the loans as the banana trees mature. Income that he will generate from selling bananas will greatly boost his living standard. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1800157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to plant more bananas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-23T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-22T03:30:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.72,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.75,"local_amount":1844.13,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1900.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262808},{"amount":34.01,"local_amount":3023.19,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3115.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265001},{"amount":16.7,"local_amount":1484.04,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1529.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459626},{"amount":35.19,"local_amount":3175.64,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3272.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.54,"payment_id":696587721},{"amount":18.01,"local_amount":1673.53,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1724.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.82,"payment_id":711506041},{"amount":96.62,"local_amount":8799.47,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":9068.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.36,"payment_id":731022848}],"funded_date":"2015-01-24T17:30:35Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":831203,"name":"Rehemah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehemah lives in Kampala, Uganda.

Most of the people make their livelihood by working as labourers in the agricultural fields belonging to farmers in neighboring and more distant villages. \r\n\r\nJulius has been practicing farming on a small inherited piece of land for the past six years. To afford a decent and comfortable life for parents and siblings, he has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from his farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, he has been engaging in other small personal businesses. \r\n\r\nThe Kericho area has high demand for poultry products. Like many farmers from his region, Julius finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and he stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d His biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. He lacks funds to increase his poultry farming, so he is seeking a loan of 60,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nBeing from a marginalized community, he finds that accessing funds is very challenging. However, through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, he feels relieved knowing that his dream will be achieved, and he will be able to buy more poultry. With the loan, he will be able to provide more eggs and poultry products to his neighbors and to the local market. This will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary man, he intends to accumulate more profits and expand his poultry business to other markets. This will increase his income and improve his living conditions. The extra income he will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan, permanently changing his living conditions, and securing the future of his school-going siblings who depend on him for school fees."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1800146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-23T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-22T03:30:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.36,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.26,"local_amount":5356.15,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5519.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265000},{"amount":47.85,"local_amount":4253.34,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4383.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601191},{"amount":52.15,"local_amount":4635.52,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4777.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459625},{"amount":53.63,"local_amount":4806.52,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4953.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.44,"payment_id":681378065},{"amount":117.15,"local_amount":10571.87,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":10894.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.78,"payment_id":696587720},{"amount":333.6,"local_amount":30376.6,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":31304.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.14,"payment_id":731022847}],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T05:16:59Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":831207,"name":"Francine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francine is 32 years old.

He is very excited to also be purchasing a solar light, apart from fertilizer and maize, because he will now be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to invest in a business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Patrick\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 3.5 acres of land and purchase a total of nine solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1750000,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-01-23T03:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-22T03:30:04Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felista N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane Naliaka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everline N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibrahim W","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary L","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronilla","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bibiana","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence N","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":72640,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72640}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T21:57:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":831197,"name":"Robina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robina has successfully built her business selling milk, with the support of Kashf Foundation and Kiva.

He is a hardworking man and aggressive with the principle of truth on his lips; he is honest and faithful to what he does and what he says. \r\n\r\nAinamoi lies in a valley. In this valley are a people who, in their totality, constitute wrenching statistics. Hardcore poverty pervades every homestead, yet every day when you look beyond the numbers, you will see a sea of people; a sea of about 5,000 bright, vibrant, open faces, searching and yearning for the opportunity to live a life of dignity and respect. They have the conviction that it\u2019s possible. \r\n\r\nArmed with this conviction, Christopher has kept hope and has been toiling on his farm for the past five years. His primary source of income is milk, crops and some vegetables that he plants. He also engages in a personal business and has been able to earn a handsome profit from the venture. Christopher practices agriculture with a difference; employing youthful energy, enthusiasm and knowledge from the many agricultural trainings he has been attending to broaden his skills. \r\n\r\nAlthough he earns handsome profits from farming, he faces one big challenge, and that is he lacks a proper and modern dairy unit. Cows in his farm are affected by harsh weather conditions; hence, they become sick. He also faces challenges of properly feeding and milking his cows. He is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. \r\n\r\nCows require a proper resting place and proper food so that they can produce the maximum amount of milk. Without a proper dairy unit, cows will be affected with diseases, and also, they will not have a good place to rest and feed, and that will result in a low production of milk. Christopher feels relieved knowing that there are partners such as Kiva lenders who assist aspiring men such as himself to achieve their dreams. With your loan, Christopher is going to change his life permanently. The increased income from high milk production will be used in paying back the loan fully and improving his living

She has a secondary education.  By nature, she is responsible and focused on her goals.  She has been involved in animal husbandry for many years already (she started 30 years ago), and this activity constitutes her family's main source of income.

She opened a small medical store in her village and provides health care facilities to the people. Both of them dedicate their life to the betterment of the village within their capability. Since there is no other medical store available in her village, she aspired to expand her medical store to meet the needs of the people. But her plans were left undone because of her financial difficulties. As most of the villagers are engaged in daily wage earnings, they do not get time to buy the medicines of their choice at other places when there is lack of medicines at her store. So the villagers have to bear the consequences of limited medication choices. \r\n\r\nShe took this problem as her own since she belongs to the same village and began to think of putting more varieties of medicines in her store. This will help both her and the villagers to meet their needs. Her Kiva loan will be used to buy the necessary medicines for her store. It will provide the people with sufficient medicine and at the same time, she can make more profit.

Despite the zone's difficulties in maintaining a revenue-generating business, these members are very courageous and solid in their determination. The members are united together and live in the same village. The main businesses are small shops, along with rainy season farming. Ms. Fatoumata (seated to the right with her left hand raised) is the star borrower of the group. She is 58 years old, widowed, and cares for three of her small children. She is a saleswoman of vegetables and palm oil, which she buys at the international market for resale in her village.

However, the family doesn't have a large enough income for living in normal living conditions or for covering all daily expenses. Ramia has a great desire to expand her agribusiness and start farming. She sought credit among local financial institutions, but her attempts were unsuccessful because of her poor living conditions. The startup program that is the joint initiative between Kiva and Credo enables the rural poor to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. Her application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 3,000 GEL for purchasing cattle and starting to sell it to the local market for increased prices. The loan will greatly assist Ramia and she will be able to improve her economic situation and give her family a better style of life, especially a good education for her children.

He lives with his family in Kampala, but is originally from Northern Uganda.  He holds a diploma in Law which he wants to upgrade to a Bachelor\u2019s degree and he is currently saving money to make this possible. \r\n\r\nDenish started out in business as an entrepreneur selling tea flasks in Kampala. While doing this, he met another micro-entrepreneur, who works for UpEnergy, and assisted him for one week. Realizing that the demand for the product was high, and that he enjoyed selling energy-efficient stoves, Denish decided to become an UpEnergy distribution partner as well. He has been successfully selling UpEnergy products for three years. He attributes his success to the uniqueness of the product on the Ugandan market as well as appreciates the well managed operations at UpEnergy which provides  quick and reliable service.\r\n \r\nIn addition to earning a living from the sale of these stoves, he believes that  protecting the environment by reducing deforestation is the biggest benefit of selling energy-efficient stoves. He is also proud to be able to improve the livelihood of people in the communities who are able to save from improved fuel use. These savings are being channeled to other expenses like school fees for children and housing expenses.\r\n\r\nHe aspires to extend his business and distribution network and eventually own his own sales store.  \r\nHis dream is to improve the education in his home area of  Northern Uganda, a region that was plagued with civil strife for over 20 years by setting up a school in the future.\r\n\r\nThe KIVA loan will make it possible for Denish to improve his business and allow him to increase his stock, so that he saves time and transportation cost by not having to travel as often to replenish his stock in order to meet the high demand for stoves.  A portion of the loan will also go towards leasing a space that he can use as a storefront both to warehouse product and also serve as a central point of sale for customers. The KIVA loan will also enable Denish to invest in basic marketing materials, such as business cards, T-Shirts and other promotional items.

Here is his story:<br \/><br \/>\u201cAs I remember, I was always an active school-boy, taking part in every event and conferences. I don\u2019t forget how we helped to publish a book about my Kochkor village for a GIZ project. As I loved History, it was amazing to discover unknown facts about our village. Bettering my English level, I volunteered at my school, teaching the 1st-2nd grades. The other important event happened when I got Informatics Certificate by USAID. The USAID staff came specially to our village to take exams and to award us. After that I participated in the competition organized by the local College of Informatics and Applied Mathematics and won a Certificate to study there for free. As that time I finished the 9th grade, I could go there, but I loved my school and preferred to stay at it. I was a Culture Minister in the School Parliament and used to hold shows and different competitions, take videos about our school and out of it.<br \/><br \/>The best my achievement can be called my full scholarship at New Generation Academy of AUCA. My social activity, knowledge of English and my big desire to study in Bishkek, helped me to realize my goal. This one year Program allowed me to gain more knowledge and skills to be able to enter AUCA, what even could be my dream at school. AUCA is the best university with the well-equipped lab and library, we have \u201cA New Star\u201d newspaper for the students, and actually I am a reporter at it. In AUCA I have a great chance to learn the theory and practice at the same time.<br \/><br \/>Kiva loan will contribute to my self-development and be one of the active and important students of AUCA. As my mother is not able to pay the full tuition, I am requesting this loan and wait for the lenders\u2019

In addition to his cows, he owns a horse and cultivates corn, which serves to feed his cows. Before acquiring his biodigester, an important portion of the income generated by the sale of milk used to go to the purchase of LP gas, chemical fertilizers and woodfuel. These expensive and unsustainable inputs were harming the environment, while the manure was being piled up outside the farm and contaminating underground water sources, emitting greenhouse gases and generating bad smells. From now on, Pablo will use this manure in a productive way to generate his own renewable energy (biogas) and organic fertilizer, taking advantage of the natural methanisation process and the bacteria inside the biodigester.

His wife sews clothing and various kind of things at home and has her own customers. Datuna also works as an artisan on private orders and generates approximately 400 GEL. He lacks the opportunity to do special work because he doesn't have the appropriate tools and that's why he requested a loan from local financial institutions. He needs financial support to purchase tools and continue running his business. \n\nDatuna has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products.\n\nThe loan will be great help to this hard-working man and his family, as he will get the chance to make his work more profitable and satisfy his clients' needs.

My schoolmates chose an expensive restaurant, booked a limo and party show at a local event agency, which forced us to spend a huge amount of money. My father wanted to borrow money and let me go, but I couldn\u2019t accept it seeing my family\u2019s financial condition. My father is a power engineering specialist with a salary of 200 USD per month. My mother is a doctor, whose salary is around 100 USD per month. This amount of money is not enough to support six members of my family. Despite daily necessities, my father has to pay for their schooling and transportation as we don\u2019t have a car. \r\n\r\nI have a very strong desire to study at AUCA and I firmly hope that Kiva lenders will give me financial support because indeed I need it. Having been provided with financial support, I guarantee to do my best to achieve high academic results and contribute myself to the development and prosperity not only of AUCA but of my whole country.\r\n\r\nI have an excellent school background. I was a brilliant school-girl with high grades and I needed just 17 more points to get a Gold Certificate at the General Republic Test. I participated with my school group in the AUCA\u2019s Brain-Ring competition and we were awarded first place. \r\n\r\nFor the above reasons and more, I want to get a degree at AUCA, so I will be able to build a bright future and make my parents be proud of me.

Here is his story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am one of the happiest students in the world because I have a chance to get a higher education in the most prestigious university in Central Asia. I am happy to be a freshman at AUCA and hope I will get a Diploma. As for me, I am from a poor family, so studying at AUCA was always a big dream. I passed the entrance exams due to my good knowledge of English, Math and other skills, which I gained at the New Generation Academy of AUCA. Finishing school, I was a finalist of the NGA Program to study one year for free, to live in the dorm and to get a monthly stipend. Thanks to NGA I got familiar with the American education system, for the first time learned about GPAs, e-courses and so on. Now I know how to be successful in my education and how education may help me in my future career and life as a whole.\r\n\r\nAs in many poor families, the main problem in my family is the lack of money. I live with my mother. She is a teacher and gets about 120 USD per month. Maybe for some people it is a laughable sum, but for us it is enough to buy food and pay utilities. In addition to this, my mom tries to find part-time or seasonable jobs that may also contribute to our family income. With such a small income, my mother can\u2019t afford my university tuition but she also can\u2019t stop me from studying at AUCA. When we were told about Kiva loans, I understood that it was the only opportunity to continue my studies at AUCA. I am an expectant sociologist. Being a sociologist means to me to be closer to people, to better understand their lives and be able to help them with the help of communication, which is so needed for orphans and old people to name but a few groups. I believe that Kiva changes lives for people like me, who are very much in need of a change.\""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1800633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Thanks to her hard work, Nargiza now has five cows and a .50 hectare plot of land on which she grows potatoes and corn.  In total, Nargiza's work earns up to 15,000 som (KGS) per month.  With the goal of increasing productivity on her farm, she has turned to \"Bai-Tushum\" bank for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy cows.  Nargiza plans to reinvest the income from this loan back into her farm and to save money to make repairs on her house."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1005,"image":{"id":1797364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy more cows for her farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kochubaev village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-01-23T18:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-22T18:20:06Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.02,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nargiza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":502.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":502.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":670}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":502.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":30097.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649514006},{"amount":461.1,"local_amount":28050.31,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":28141.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.74,"payment_id":711411357},{"amount":31.38,"local_amount":1949.69,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:58:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1956.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.28,"payment_id":730933611}],"funded_date":"2015-02-22T04:39:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":831612,"name":"Darinchuluun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Darinchuluun, 45 years old, lives with his wife and 2 daughters in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. \r\n\r\nMr. Darinchuluun has been running his grocery store since 2011.

thatched roofs with waterproof corrugated iron. The memory of this collective effort led him to join Mereonik self-help group. \r\n\r\nFor 10 years, Wilson's primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, and horticultural produce. His biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals to prevent these crop diseases. \r\n\r\nWilson decided to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help him improve his farming activities. Sometime last month, he applied for a loan to expand his horticulture farm. This will enable him to expand his operations and increase the overall output. \r\n\r\nThe additional income from the expansion will go to Wilson's children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is increasingly becoming prohibitive to low-income communities, especially in the rural areas. As a result, children are forced to drop out and work to contribute earnings to their families' income.\r\n \r\nWith your loan, Wilson\u2019s children will acquire quality education that will act as a strong foundation for their bright futures."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":439.4,"image":{"id":1800725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to expand his horticulture farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-23T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-22T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.04,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.26,"local_amount":5356.15,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5519.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265010},{"amount":47.85,"local_amount":4253.34,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4383.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601200},{"amount":52.15,"local_amount":4635.52,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4777.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459635},{"amount":53.63,"local_amount":4806.52,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4953.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.44,"payment_id":681378072},{"amount":53.78,"local_amount":4853.18,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5001.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.82,"payment_id":696587729},{"amount":52.17,"local_amount":4849.62,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4997.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.39,"payment_id":711506050},{"amount":56.64,"local_amount":5157.73,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5315.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.38,"payment_id":731022856},{"amount":56.88,"local_amount":5145.92,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5303.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.01,"payment_id":752111046}],"funded_date":"2015-02-22T14:03:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nathan Tichenor","image":28733}},{"id":830370,"name":"Ma Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Mercedes se encuentra muy feliz y muy agradecida con Dios primeramente por todas las bendiciones brindadas, ya que con su primer financiamiento pudo comprar insumos agr\u00edcolas con los que pudo asistir sus cultivos de caf\u00e9 y prevenir que estos fueran afectados por plagas entre otras como el ojo de gayo, la roya, heladas en el grano (factor clima).

Being a father of eight has been his main motive for fighting tirelessly day after day, seeking alternatives to earn a living and support his children. Approximately 10 years ago, he started doing mixed farming and through those years he has gathered so much experience with the techniques of farming. Through the income from farming he has been able to take care of his family and also provide the basic needs for his children. <br \/><br \/>Paul is a very enterprising man, and although he never got formal employment, he has always worked hard on his farm and he has always assured his family of a decent meal. The Kericho area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why he is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, he is sure that he will reap maximum profits and be able to increase his business. <br \/><br \/>Being a man from a marginalized community and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Paul feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising men like him. Paul is much disciplined with finances and he plans that through the accumulated profits he will be able to improve his living conditions and also secure the future of his children. Paul says that his age doesn't stop him from doing what he is passionate about. That is why he always sets new goals for himself and among them is becoming a great horticulture farmer and to generate employment opportunities. This way he will be able to improve his quality of life and the well-being of his family and those people who help him do his daily work.

So far, he has been involved in this career for around 20 years. On average, he is able to make an income of USD 2.00 a day.\r\n\r\nThe earnings that he receives from his farming is every low. He wants to have one more business as supplementary income. However, his limited capital doesn't allow him to do so. That is why he is applying for a Kiva loan as capital to run a business buying and selling scrap. This loan will allow him to have one more source of income, which will help to remove poverty from his life.

Since then, their farm and family have grown in more ways than one. In 2008, the couple started working on a rundown farm. Today, they are making money off the poultry and dairy animals they raise and also the maize and vegetables they grow. Joseph has further invested in a side hustle business to supplement the meager income he earns from farming. \r\n\r\nJoseph loves to dairy farm, especially since it was always a life goal of his to be a farmer. His wife understands this and together they joined hearts and hands to make the farm\u2019s success to date happen. Joseph is seeking a loan to purchase a pedigree dairy cow. There are more than 100 cattle breeds in Kenya. However, not all are good producers of milk. In fact, very few are. Cattle aside, the tastes and preferences of milk in the market is really growing diverse in Kenya. Taking milk is no longer a matter of pouring it into our cereal bowl, adding it to our coffee, or drinking it straight from the glass; we now have preferences in the type of milk we drink. Today, milk consumers are spoiled by choices. In the market, we have old-fashioned cow\u2019s milk and lactose-free milk, not to mention non-dairy options such as almond, rice and coconut milk. It takes dairy masters like Joseph to pick these shifts in the market and adopt ingenious techniques in farming to ensure that their product qualities adapt to the changes in consumer preference. Purchasing a pedigree cow goes to show how Joseph is keen on controlling lameness levels in his dairy cattle. He considers breeding to be the core of his overall strategy of ensuring that milk quantity is way above average and the milk quality is second to none in the market. He anticipates that feeding will be his highest cost of milk production. This, to him, is acceptable because to get cows that milk well and remain healthy, they have to be fed properly. \r\n\r\nYour loan will make a significant difference to Joseph's farm profitability. The couple will make use of the returns from this investment to pay for the loan and to pay for their children\u2019s education. The rest will be reinvested in the business. It has always been their ambition to share their passion about farming with their children. They hope the kids will be thrilled to join the business of running the family farm."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":503.04,"image":{"id":1800795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a pedigree cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-23T20:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-22T20:40:07Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.59,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":161.94,"local_amount":14394.44,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":14834.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265011},{"amount":161.92,"local_amount":14512.54,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:20Z","rounded_local_amount":14955.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.35,"payment_id":681378074},{"amount":173.59,"local_amount":15807.31,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":16290.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.24,"payment_id":731022858}],"funded_date":"2015-02-22T18:13:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":831659,"name":"Milikije","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Milikije is once again requesting a loan for her same business, this time to purchase food for her cows.

Most people residing in that area are engaged in daily wage earning. Although she had a baby girl, she had to do something in order to meet her family's expenses. She planned to open a tea stall, which she thought could help her manage her household expenses. She rented a place at Tuibuong district Head Quarter, aspiring to earn more income for her family's maintenance. Her husband supports and helps her in running the tea stall. To keep her business in full swing, she used to go and buy the necessary items twice a week from the main market in town. She also mentioned that there was no other tea stall like hers in that area so she wanted to expand her tea stall, which will eventually help her in increasing her income and meet her family expenses. The income that she gets was not enough for her family's expenses so she was unable to buy the necessary items for the tea stall. With the help of her Kiva loan, she plans on purchasing more items for the tea stall, which would help her increase her income. Most of the villagers come to her tea stall as it is the only tea stall available in her village. She thanks WSDS for helping her by providing loans at a low interest and making her life much better than it was before."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1800780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase items such as tea leaves, edible oil, wheat flour, milk powder and noodles for her tea stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2015-01-23T20:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-22T20:40:07Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vahhat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoiching","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingboi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chingngaineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-09T23:09:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":831665,"name":"Kyon Thout Village Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This community is located in Kyon Thout Village, in the Myanmar Ayeyarwaddy Delta region.

Robert, who has been farming for the last seven years, keeps cattle, poultry and trees on his 2-acre piece of land. \r\nRobert is seeking a loan for purchasing a chaff cutter. Dairy cows prefer their fodder cut into pieces of a certain size: not so big that it is hard to digest, and not so small that it is not \"fun\" to chew. A chaff cutter solves this problem perfectly. Electrically operated, a chaff cutting machine chops fodder into small, even pieces that the cows will enjoy chewing. The other advantage of the machine is that different grasses can be fed into it to achieve a desired feed ration. This creates mixtures that lead to higher milk production since the cows cannot select what to eat and what not to. \r\nThe increase in income from this asset will uplift the livelihood of Robert's family, which consists of Janet, his wife of 12 years, and five children ranging in age from 3 to 10."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":191.82,"image":{"id":1800870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a chaff cutter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-23T21:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-22T21:00:08Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.58,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.07,"local_amount":4548.66,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4855.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601204},{"amount":26.64,"local_amount":2305.77,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2461.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.26,"payment_id":681378076},{"amount":53.06,"local_amount":4622.22,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4934.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.87,"payment_id":696587732},{"amount":56.47,"local_amount":4964.85,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5299.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.45,"payment_id":731022860}],"funded_date":"2015-02-16T13:39:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":831631,"name":"Lawrence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lawrence lives in Masindi, Uganda.

It is composed of eight members and is led by a directive board with Mrs. Nieves as the President.  The businesses that the members of the communal association work are varied.  Among them are:  transportation service, scrap metal recycling, neighborhood store, blanket sales, bottle recycling, sale of cellular accessories, hardware store and food sales.  \r\n\r\nThe credit that they will get will benefit small micro businesses where Mrs. Nieves is integral.  She says that ten years ago she joined Pro Woman, at the invitation of a friend who is a client of the institution.  Presently she has a scrap metal recycling business.  She let us know that she started that business with a little capital that she had from a previous business.  Upon observing the large business of those recyclable materials, she decided to undertake this business.  \r\n\r\nThe loan that she will now get is for an increase in capital (purchase of scrap metals mostly) which she will acquire from the smaller recycled goods vendors and later will sell to the recycling companies.  This type of work permits her to generate funds to support her family economically, since she is single and has three children.  When asked what she likes about Pro Woman, she responds that she likes the trainings that the institution offers and the sharing with her companions.
