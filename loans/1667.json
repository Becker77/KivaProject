Even with savannah plains and little human activity, there exists a farm that stands tall, a farm with over two high-pedigreed Friesian cows, producing over 10 litres of milk. It\u2019s quite an outstanding feat, considering the harsh terrain and other handicaps, like the lack of electricity from the national grid and being dependent on traditional methods of harvesting water.<br \/><br \/>Kiva lenders, meet Eric, the man credited with the success story of the farm. He is a 29-year-old very hardworking man, ambitious and ever-smiling. Eric is a very dedicated farmer and has so much experience in farming that he is touted to be among the best farmers in his village. Eric has been practicing farming for the past 10 years. Through hard work, he has been able to support his siblings. He always provides a plate of food for them. He offers free services to farmers who are still upcoming and free Extension services to farmers in nearby villages.<br \/><br \/>Eric is seeking funds to open an agro vet shop in his village. This need arose because so many farmers have nowhere to buy animal medicine and food. Eric, being an enterprising person, wants to take advantage of the ready market that is there and make more profits. Eric is also a farmer and will benefit from the shop because he will not be going far to look for food and medicine, hence cutting down transportation costs.<br \/><br \/>Through Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders, Eric is confident that this loan will help aspiring farmers like him turn their dreams into reality and that, through the training he will get, he will be able to successfully run his agro vet shop.<br \/><br \/>As Eric discloses, his determination to succeed in farming springs from the confidence that he has through his many years of farming. Eric plans to manage his agro vet business in a professional and profitable way. Through this, he will assure his parents and siblings of a secure future, and his parents will have improved living

She studied up to the 3rd grade. She is happily married. Her husband emigrated to the United States 4 years ago, where he works in construction. From their relationship they have 3 children between 19 and 11 years old, all of whom are in school. Two go to university and the youngest is in school.\r\n\r\nAreli has a business selling pupusas in her home, which she starts making early in the morning until 10:00 am. The business is profitable because it is located close to a university and the students are her principal clients. Her older daughters also collaborate with her in this work.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan is for buying another griddle on which to make pupusas. The one she has is already quite old and is very small. Also, she needs to be ready because the semester starts soon and she wants to buy consumable such as wood, corn and pork rinds. \r\n\r\nThe dream Areli has is to grow her business in order to generate better earnings. She also dreams of expanding and improving her home so that she and her children can live more

Thanks to her very hard work, she has managed to develop a very strong farming business: she owns four cows, 12 sheep, two horses, and she also grows barley on 1.17 hectare of land.  In order to further grow her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy more livestock.

Her main activity consists in selling vegetables and fruits at the market and in cattle breeding and agriculture, which she started in 2005.  Thanks to her very hard work and constant labor, she has really managed to grow her business and she now makes a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS).  However, this amount of money is still insufficient to provide a decent living and to raise her son.  Nurgul currently owns two cows and ten sheep.  She also grows barley on 0.5 hectare of land.  In order to further grow her business, and to derive more profits from it, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC, and requested a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to buy one cow.  She is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further increase her livestock headcount.

He lives with his wife and two school-aged sons. The only source of income for this four- member family is from a small agricultural activity. In particular, Gia and his wife work on the family-owned agricultural land growing maize, mandarins and nuts. They sell the harvested products at the local market and generate insignificant seasonal income. The family lives under poverty as the mentioned income is hardly enough to cover even basic needs. \r\n\r\nGia can\u2019t find any stable job and decided to start his own business in order, somehow, to improve his family's living conditions. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Gia applied for credit from MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses. Gia will buy a car and start providing a taxi service. He will serve local people and generate more stable income for his family's increased needs. \r\n\r\nHe is a very enthusiastic and hardworking person with a great desire to ensure his children have a good education for progressing in life.  This credit will be a great support for the family. Gia is thankful to Kiva lenders for giving him a chance to generate income.

They live in a rented house that has potable water, electricity, and sewer service. She makes a living selling traditional foods such as beef with rice and potatoes, spicy chicken with freeze-dried potatoes, baked chicken, and baked suckling pig. She cooks in the market in the morning so everything will be ready at midday; she runs out of food within three hours. \"I bought a stove a few years ago to work in the kitchen, and I've gotten maximum use out of it,\" she says. Her dream is to have a restaurant with kitchen assistants, and she hopes to invest in buying ingredients such as flour, eggs, vegetables, potatoes, and so on, so that her cupboards will be fully stocked for daily cooking.

She is based in Kaptumo, a remote village in the Nandihills , an area with fertile soil famous for dairy farming. The region's staple food is \u201cMursik,\u201d a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from milk. \r\n\r\nHellen has been practicing mixed farming for the past twenty years. Selling eggs and milk has earned her a decent income. She also engages in another business to make ends meet. Hellen passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every morning to milk her cow. \r\n\r\nWhile this humble mom has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of having enough land to expand her dairy and crop farming. She is requesting a loan to buy a piece of land. With this loan she will be able to increase her farming and be able to produce more crops.

In particular, they have pigs, and they also cultivate a plot of agricultural land and harvest fruits and vegetables. Areknaz works at the local public school, where she makes a 380 GEL monthly salary. To make the work more profitable, Areknaz decided to start trading sunflowers. \r\n\r\nShe needs financial support to purchase special equipment for processing the sunflowers, which she can then sell at the local market. \r\n\r\nAreknaz has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nThe Start Up credit will be a great support for the family, as their income will be significantly increased.

The school season is about to begin, so she is requesting a new loan in order to buy notebooks, pencils, erasers, correction fluid, marker pens and school materials, which are in great demand at this time of year. She will also buy basic staples such as rice, sugar and beans in order to continue investing in merchandise. \r\n\r\nWhen she pays off this loan she is considering investing in cosmetics to sell, and this way continue varying her products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1799384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy notebooks, pencils, erasers, correction fluid, marker pens, rice, sugar and beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Granada","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2015-01-24T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-23T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Geovana Del Socorro \t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":262.68,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":29.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.19},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.59,"local_amount":29.22,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":30.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624461987},{"amount":31.01,"local_amount":29.62,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-19T11:21:14Z","rounded_local_amount":31.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636864871},{"amount":31.12,"local_amount":29.73,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":31.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649617110},{"amount":29.66,"local_amount":28.33,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":29.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665097208},{"amount":30.9,"local_amount":29.52,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":30.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681395473},{"amount":30.33,"local_amount":28.97,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:16:28Z","rounded_local_amount":30.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696605771},{"amount":30.63,"local_amount":29.26,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":30.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711528231},{"amount":30.5,"local_amount":29.13,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":30.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731044175},{"amount":30.26,"local_amount":28.9,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":30.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752133161}],"funded_date":"2015-01-26T17:31:15Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T17:11:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":830997,"name":"Li\u00ean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Li\u00ean works in agriculture raising poultry and\u00a0cattle.

He is arguably among the most successful clients of Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance institution that deals only with smallholder farmers in rural parts of Kenya. Back in 2009, Lameck practiced traditional farming with little knowledge and no financing at all. He was doing only half an acre of maize crops per season. The returns were so meager that he could barely fend for survival. He kept doing maize farming for years without turning a profit until 2012, when he switched to tomato, poultry and dairy farming and finally, there was light at the end of the tunnel for Lameck. Today, Lameck is a fully-fledged entrepreneur. He has been provided with technical guidance, training programs and exposure visits. He has already serviced other asset-based loans fully from Juhudi Kilimo. Through these loans, he has acquired high quality dairy cows and poultry. To capitalize more on the returns from booming tomato farming, Lameck is seeking a loan of KES 180,000 to build a greenhouse and buy a motorbike. Unlike his competition, Lameck conducts proper soil preparation and uses modern farming techniques to ensure high quality produce. By doing this, he has created a name for himself and a demand for his produce. The motorbike will assist Lameck to transport his products to the market in a timely manner. Tomatoes and milk are very perishable and they require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price and with this loan, all that will be achieved. Your lending will contribute greatly to the actualization of Lameck's goal, which is to be the lead supplier of tomatoes. In the future, he is also planning to introduce zero the grazing method, intensify his maize farming, and start value addition."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":931.2,"image":{"id":1797321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

This is why, to Brigida, VisionFund\u2019s support is very important, because she has been able to incorporate more products to her store, offering a better supply to her customers. Generally, she reinvests in the most demanded products: water, oil, rice, sugar, beans, canned chilies, seasonings, coffee, candy, cookies, soft drinks, milk, juice, and cheese.\r\n\r\nA year before opening the grocery store, Brigida had a laundromat, which she decided to close due to her husband\u2019s health, since she didn\u2019t want to neglect him. Her biggest challenge is to continue with the store despite the high competition in the community. To overcome this challenge, she treats her customers in a friendly manner.

the Mbarara district. He is a repeat borrower who has borrowed over 10 loans from UGAFODE. Mathius started in a group and later graduated to getting individual loans, which have helped him meet his needs like finishing his house, buying a new motorcycle, and also improving his agriculture business.\r\n\r\nMathius is one of the best farmers in Kashari who benefits from government programs related to agriculture and has managed to put his children in good schools. But sometime back, his plantation was affected by hail storms and he could not yield quality bananas. They are currently replanting and the plantation needs manure in order to regain its lost glory and have good yields. So, Mathius has come to UGAFODE for a loan of UGX 2,000,000 to buy manure like cow dung and mulch to spread on his banana plantation. This will help him to increase his yield and sales.

His business is the production and sale of cheese. He is a hardworking, humble, and persevering person. He performs his work en the community of Igachi at an elevation of 3,735 meters above sea level and 65 kilometers from the city of La Paz.\r\n\r\nCarlos is dark-skinned with black hair, average height, and dark eyes. His native language is Aymara, and he uses Spanish for business. His routine begins in the early hours of the morning, even before the roosters announce the dawn. In this area of the town of Batallas, working in dairy products to develop this characteristic of consistency is a tradition that is shared in large part by the inhabitants. With little earnings and plenty of effort, he strives daily to bring his fresh products to the street. \r\n\r\nThere are many costs that are incurred to arrive at the final product. The process begins with the fresh milk. The containers to store the cheese are made with totora, a native plant. Carlos says, \"Making cheese is a process that my mother taught me, and it is the principal nourishment for my family.\" \r\n\r\nThe main problem for Carlos is the little production of milk. The rainy season was very short, and did not help to grow more grass to feed the cows. This had direct repercussions in obtaining milk, and the daily supply is insufficient for an increased production of cheese. Depending on the season of the year, the grass spoils and this decreases the production of milk.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons Carlos is requesting a loan to buy dairy cows to increase his cheese production, and improve his quality of life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1788037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Even though her husband passed away, she didn't lose hope but she alone thought of doing her best for her children and for her family management. She decided to take care of her children herself. She came across many hardships as she was the lone breadwinner of her family. She engaged herself in daily wage earning and other work like selling readymade clothes in the markets. Sometimes she also sells her goods from door to door. She is a very dedicated woman. She is not the kind of woman who just gives up but keeps on trying until she gets what she is looking for. \r\n\r\nWith the little income she saved, she rented a place and opened a small store for selling readymade clothes. She thought by opening a store, she could earn more income than before for her family.

They live within the limit of the income derived from her weaving and her husband\u2019s earnings. \r\n\r\nShe wishes to buy a weaving machine just like the one in the photograph, which is work efficient for producing abundant clothes for sale. She said it will increase her income and help her live more adequately. The loan will help her buy a weaving machine of her dreams. She will be able to produce more clothes for sale and help with her family maintenance adequately. She gives thanks to Kiva for being a part of making her dreams come true. She now feels enlightened and will continue to work harder. All the other members are very proactive and expect progressive changes in their businesses with the help of the Kiva loan.

She has two sons (ages 8 and 13) and a six-year-old daughter.  Her business involves selling plastic goods.  <br \/><br \/>Rocio is a good mother who is enterprising, independent, responsible, and hardworking.  She conducts her business in the District of El Tejar, which is known for all types of informal trade.  Hundreds of merchants can be seen side-by-side selling clothes, food, meats, fruit, and other products.  The weather is cold and dry.  The temperature can vary between 5 and 15 degrees centigrade during the day throughout the entire year.  <br \/><br \/>Rocio has a dark complexion, long black hair, dark eyes, and a short stature.  Her native language is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks with her family.  However, she speaks Spanish so that she can integrate into the general culture and conduct business.  In the photo, Rocio is the first person standing on the right, dressed in black.  She shares her life with her husband who is a food merchant and her children who are in school.  They live in a rented brick house that has running water, electricity, and sewage services.  Needing to expand her business, Rocio decided to lead a Communal Bank.  Her group includes businesspeople who sell chicken, sell flowers, provide tea service, operate a sewing workshop, sell cosmetics, produce mattresses, and sell jackets.  Rocio\u2019s business involves selling plastic goods such as buckets, tumblers, cutlery, crates, and other items.  She conducts her business every day of the week.  \u201cMy merchandise is quite affordable, so I am able to generate good sales and earn a good income,\u201d says Rocio.

This place is known throughout the country for the delicious sweets prepared by the locals, and for the warmth of its friendly, hardworking people.  Graciela, 61, lives here.  She is married and has 6 adult children.  One daughter is a single mother who lives with them and her small child. Graciela's husband is a merchant.\r\n\r\nGraciela got into business with the goal of helping her husband with the household expenses since he does not make much money.  Every Sunday she pays for a car to travel to  Calderon, a small city, where she sells rice by the quintal (100 lb bags) or in small bags. She takes advantage of the fact that this is a day off and it is typically when people from the country do their shopping.  She sells her rice at a very good price so that people buy from her.  She has had this business for more than 11 years, earning a bit of money and doing something she loves. \r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy rice for her weekly sales.  She has been part of the lending group for 10 years and she likes it because she is able to improve her situation with the loans.  Her dream is to buy her own car because she has to pay to transport her products. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1799489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Rocafuerte","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2015-01-25T16:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-24T16:00:22Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela Auxiliadora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":970.26,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":97.03},{"due_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":97.03},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":97.03},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":97.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":97.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":97.03},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":97.03},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":97.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":97.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":96.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.51},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.51},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.51},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":195.02,"local_amount":194.06,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:45:45Z","rounded_local_amount":195.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611785962},{"amount":195.02,"local_amount":194.06,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":195.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624232513},{"amount":195,"local_amount":194.06,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":195,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636218256},{"amount":195,"local_amount":194.06,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":195,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649569902},{"amount":194.96,"local_amount":194.02,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":194.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665050445}],"funded_date":"2015-01-25T19:03:27Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:20:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":830914,"name":"Alda Liliana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el cant\u00f3n Rocafuerte se  re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas las socias del Grupo de Cr\u00e9dito Dulce Amistad.
