His advantage is that he is recognized in his neighborhood and the quality of his products is very good, such that it has allowed him to get more customers for his business and has transformed into good orders.\r\n\r\nHe prefers to work about 10 hours a day.\r\n\r\nSince his production capacity cannot catch up to satisfy all his clients' orders, Mauricio desires a loan to buy sewing supplies such as fabric, thread, needles, lace, buttons, and others, to supply his shop.\r\n\r\nHis greatest yearning is to succeed with his tailoring shop and be able to have the best economic opportunities in his household to progress together with his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1800337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy sewing supplies such as fabric, thread, needles, lace, buttons, and others, to stock his shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2015-01-26T00:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-25T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.1,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mauricio Andres ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.7,"local_amount":64098,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:34:49Z","rounded_local_amount":64745.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.54,"payment_id":624865548},{"amount":63.12,"local_amount":148522,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":150021.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636622935},{"amount":32.93,"local_amount":77485,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:27:20Z","rounded_local_amount":78267.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649596983},{"amount":33.5,"local_amount":78835,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T12:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":79631.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665456184},{"amount":33.86,"local_amount":81804,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":82630.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.91,"payment_id":681374135},{"amount":30.98,"local_amount":83704,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-21T12:25:50Z","rounded_local_amount":84549.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.59,"payment_id":697632136},{"amount":31.58,"local_amount":85998,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":86866.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.97,"payment_id":711501618},{"amount":145.23,"local_amount":379554,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":383387.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.09,"payment_id":731019304}],"funded_date":"2015-02-19T23:44:12Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:16:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Barrington Lloyd","image":null}},{"id":831318,"name":"Melania","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Melania es una Se\u00f1ora emprendedora, ella compra y vende art\u00edculos de acero como relojes y cadenas, ella tiene un peque\u00f1o negocio del cual logra el sustento para su familia.

She works hard to augment her income to support and meet her family's daily personal and household needs.\r\n\r\nEdelie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store that sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also has a direct selling business for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 600 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan, which she will use to buy grocery items such as sacks of rice, noodles, canned goods, soda and other grocery stuffs. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are the source to meet their daily expenses. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her.\r\n\r\nEdelie hopes to maintain and grow her business so she they can have a more comfortable life and prepare for her old age. She prays for good health and a happy family.

They also taught him to grow staple grain crops.\r\n\r\nJes\u00fas will use the money from this loan to purchase fishing nets. In this way he will improve his fishing equipment. He dreams of his family obtaining good fishing equipment, and also of improving his dwelling to improve the security of his family. He also dreams that his children will have the opportunity to get an education.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1800413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase fishing nets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"La Uni\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-01-26T06:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-25T06:40:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesus Amadeo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":30.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":31.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35.76},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":36.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":37.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":39.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":43.6},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":42.81},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":45.08},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":48.86},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50.36},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":52.12},{"due_date":"2016-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":53.66},{"due_date":"2016-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":55.13},{"due_date":"2017-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":64.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.76},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.65},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.6},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.81},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.08},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.86},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.36},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.12},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.66},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.13},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kati Mayfield","image":470169}},{"id":832227,"name":"Karafuu Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anna is 43 years old, not married and has got three schooling children.

She is newly married to Glen, a driver. They both work for their daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nPrincess Kaye has a small business of her own. She buys several packs of biscuits, cookies, and sandwich spread from a wholesaler which she sells at retail price. Filipinos love to eat biscuits and cookies. They usually send them as snacks for their kids at school and for field trips as well. She sells them per order and on demand on special occasions and holidays. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue with her business, she would like to apply for a 10,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy more packs of biscuits, cookies, and sandwich spread. She is thanking God for a good return on her investment and the financial help that will be given to her. It will surely help meet their daily needs and save for their future offspring.\r\n\r\nPrincess Kaye aims to grow her business and own or rent a place to display and sell her goods. She prays for good health and a prosperous life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

He added the business of mobile money transfers to boost his income, as his profit margins were very low and he struggled to provide basic needs for his family. Today the combined incomes from his two businesses help Luka earn a decent living.\r\n\r\nLuka is requesting a loan from Kiva because he wants to pay for his trading booth which he currently uses it to make his transactions but has not paid for it due to lack of capital. This loan will also help Luka to add on the money that he has to serve customers in his business.

She is married, and lives with 6 children at home; they study at school in different school grades, and are also a support in the countryside. Her level of education is primary, which she didn't complete, reaching the third grade, and she is grateful to her parents for their efforts so that she could study; she did not finish for financial reasons. Along with her husband she makes a living planting and harvesting basic grains such as maize and beans, on her own land a few metres from her house; this allows her to pay greater attention to her crops and keep an eye on them. Her trading market is on the outskirts of the community. Shop owners sometimes come to her to purchase her stock in advance, since they know how high the quality of her products is. She is currently asking for a loan which would help to buy farming supplies, which would in turn help to fertilise the crops as needed, in order to have a full harvest of maize; this would be beneficial to generate the income she needs. As a supplier and farmer, her goal is to expand her land, plant more maize seeds and continually build her business, as this would help to generate more income and allow her children's dreams of studying to come true, so that they might get excel in their lives.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1800420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"para compra de insumos agricolas para asistir sus cultivos de maiz ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Siguatepeque, Comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2015-01-26T10:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-25T10:40:09Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T17:43:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Claire Parsons","image":null}},{"id":832242,"name":"Jetherine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is thirty-two-year-old Jetherine.

Her experience helps her in the day-to-day running of the business and she enjoys talking to her customers. Jetherine says that her community benefits from her business of mobile money transfers because they no longer have to travel long distances to access financial services. She is very pleased with the business because it allows her to have a minimum income at the end of the month to pay her rent. \r\n\r\nJetherine is pleased to be connected to the Kiva lenders and have the opportunity to access working capital support. She explains that running her own business has not been easy. This is due to the fact the she does not have enough money in her business to serve customers who want to send and receive larger amounts of money. Currently, Jetherine is operating with a very low amount of capital reserves. This is not enough because mobile money is becoming more popular and the demand for the product has increased. Her second challenge is the she does not have any branding and signage to direct customers to her place of business.\r\n\r\nJetherine is requesting a Kiva loan so that she can grow her business, by adding money to enable her to serve more customers. With increased working capital, Jetherine will also use part of the funds to purchase some paint so that she can paint her place of business and put up signs to bring more customers to her shop.

Her hometown is Kabwe, located in the central province of Zambia. She operates her own Zoona mobile money transfer business in Lusaka, which is the capital city of Zambia. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is a nurse by profession. She recently decided to start her own business because her salary was too low to sustain the needs of her growing family. When asked what she enjoys most about running her business, Elizabeth says providing a service to people who do not have bank accounts or are intimidated by the formal banking environment makes her feel like she is contributing a needed service for her community. She also gets enjoyment from being able to employ others now that she is a business owner. Currently, Elizabeth has one employee.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth is requesting a loan in order to pay for a trading booth, which will help her business become more visible and serve more customers at her shop. She is working with a very small amount of capital, which makes it difficult to service her growing customer base. She constantly struggles to serve particular customers. The loan will go to providing her the working capital needed to serve these customers, grow her business, and make the day-to-day operations of her business more efficient. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is confident that she will be able to open additional mobile money outlets. In doing so, she will be able to earn more profits and take care of her family better.

She is making good repayments on her Kiva loan and now hopes to get a new Kiva loan so that she can have essential transaction cash needed for her to grow her business. \r\n\r\nPrior to running her own business, Kasongo worked as a customer service assistant at one of the Mobile telecommunication firms in Lusaka, Zambia. She started her own company because she believes that her mobile money business is very useful for families in her community.

The Kiva loan will help Kasongo to serve customers who need to send and receive money from her trading booth. \r\n\r\nKasongo has requested a subsequent loan so that she can serve her customers with much ease. She says the float in her business is not sufficient and as a result she constantly has to close her booth and make trips to the banks. This inconveniences her customers, as they sometimes find the booth closed. Kasongo is hopeful that once she gets her Kiva loan, she will be able to serve customers without a lot of problems and grow her business.\r\n\r\nKasongo\u2019s dream is to take her children to good schools.

Anna decided to engage in the bakery business where she bakes cakes and bread and has done so for the last ten years. She works from 07 am to 09 pm each working day and is able to make a good profit every month.\r\n\r\nFrom Tujijenge Tanzania, as Kiva partner, this is her second credit request, wishing to improve her business with baking ingredients and better baking equipment. She used the previous loan to buy baking items; baking flour,cooking oil and other ingredients. Anna has paid back her loan in full. She received some extra income, which she used to pay for her family expenses.

Intisar used to read a lot about date seeds and its benefits, so she decided two years ago to start her experiments to find a way to make a product from those seeds that people can use to take its benefits. She tried many ways - boiling, frying, etc, and all failed. Then she looked at a seed, and thought that it looked like a coffee seed, so she decided to go through the process of making coffee using date seeds, and she succeeded. She produced decaf coffee from date seeds using home tools.\n \nIntisar then used her savings and bought the equipment she needed to do the whole process. She rented a place to open a small workshop where she can work with her older children and start making coffee. She got the needed certificates that support the product and its quality. \n\nNow she is expanding to make a coffee powder that can be used in making sweets. Intisar is applying for a loan to help her buy a vacuum packing machine that will give her product a two year expiration period, instead of the six months based on what she is using today.\n\nIntisar is a mother for five boys and a girl aged between 23 years old and 4 years old.

","en":"Nilsa, 21, is a farmer and has a small daughter. After finishing primary school, Nilsa decided to learn how to grow basic grains (such as maize and broad beans). She started at a very young age and learned how to be a farmer from her parents, who taught her all the techniques and knowledge necessary to do a splendid job. Nilsa sells her harvest to businesses in the area, such as stockpilers and grocery shops. Her parents help her with her business, and she also hires farm hands from time to time to assist her in caring for the crops, since it is very important to employ time and resources effectively to reap a good harvest. Nilsa goes every day to her plot of land to tend to her crops very attentively in order to make them grow. She aims for an abundant harvest and profitable sales. This is why she asks COMIXMUL for a loan to buy eight quintals of urea, eight quintals of 12-24-12 formula, seven litres of foliar fertiliser, and seven litres of herbicide, as well as to hire farm hands to more efficiently use the above farm supplies.

None of her children is as yet of school age. She has a common-law husband. She completed secondary education, up to the third year, thanks to her parents' financial support, without which she would have had to drop out. She and her husband grow and harvest basic grains, such as maize and broad beans. This is their only source of income. In the place where she lives, the climate and the soil are very good for farming, and being a farmer is in Hilda's blood, since it is a trade that is passed on from generation to generation, in an area where there are not many other options in terms of economic activity. She sells her harvest to various stockpilers in the area and neighbouring villages. This is a tried-and-tested circuit since the stockpilers then sell grain to other markets. The family owns their plot of land, located very near their house. which makes tending to the crops much easier and more convenient. Hilda is asking for a loan to buy farm supplies in order to protect her crops from disease and help their growth. She needs urea, 12-24-12 formula, foliar fertiliser, and herbicide, and also wants to hire farm hands. Her goal is to profit as much as possible from the sale her harvest, in order to make her dreams come true. She dreams of supporting her children through school and of making her business grow so as to increase the family's income and carve out a better life for all of them."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1800467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farm supplies and hire farm hands.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Siguatepeque, Comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2015-01-26T16:10:38Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-25T16:10:38Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda Yamileth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T23:06:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":832304,"name":"Maninoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maninoa is a 50-year-old mother with seven children and has a small business selling vegetables (cabbages, eggplant, and cucumbers) in her community to earn a living.

Meet John. He is a forty-one-year-old smallholder farmer from Ruiru village in the Central region of Kenya. Like most farmers in the region, John practices mixed farming. He keeps dairy animals and grows maize among other crops. He has been doing this work for a decade now. Over the years, he has come to like farming because it is a sustainable and self-fulfilling investment.\r\n\r\nFarming doesn\u2019t take all John's time, so he is also able to attend to his salary-paying job. A delicate balance of both jobs has enabled him to comfortably raise his two children. John is seeking a loan to purchase poultry and construct a chicken coop. He is ready to get into commercial production for meat, eggs and, perhaps, feathers. This business is very profitable but it doesn\u2019t require a license, a big space or product marketing. There is an established market for poultry products in almost all places around the world. Besides, chickens will bring many non-monetary benefits to John\u2019s farm. Chickens will be great for his farm's compost because their poop is high in nitrogen; in free-range, they will naturally forage by scratching soil looking for bugs, which aerates the soil and breaks up vegetation for decomposition. \r\n\r\nJohn will also use your money to construct a chicken coop in order to make the raising of chickens easier.

She is the mother of three children, but none of them are dependent on her since they are all independent and live in their own households.  Her parents taught her how to plant and cultivate corn and beans at a young age, since it was their family's only source of income.  She is from a humble and hardworking background.  She attended primary school through her third year, but she was not able to finish her studies due to a lack of financial support.  \r\n\r\nShe sells her crops to different warehouses located in the outskirts of the area where she lives.  She plants and cultivates the corn herself and her husband and children sometimes help, but most of the time she pays laborers to do extra work that she can't do herself because of the physical effort.  This often includes weeding and planting.  \r\n\r\nAntonia is requesting help to purchase supplies, including manure, fertilizers, and other items, and to pay laborers to do work on her land.  Her goal is to have a good harvest so that she can achieve her other goals, including increasing her amount of cultivated land, diversifying her crops with coffee and red and black beans, and others that will help increase her income so she can improve her family's

Her oldest son is 15 years old, while the youngest children are pre-school age. Bazargul has a high school degree and has been raising livestock and farming for the last 15 years. She started her farm by purchasing cattle with 5,000 som (KGS). Her hard work has allowed Bazargul to expand the herd, which now contain 4 cows, 2 horses and 10 sheep. She also rents 1 hectare (2.5 acres) of land as well as owns 0.2 hectares (0.5 acres), where she grows oats. The monthly profits from the animals and the farm are 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further expand her farm, Bazargul has turned to \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan of 10,000 som (KGS), which she will use to buy more cattle. She will invest the profits from this loan by continuing to expand her herd and hopes to save enough money to build a new barn for her livestock.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":141.54,"image":{"id":1798454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase feed for livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ken-Jilga village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-01-26T18:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-25T18:00:09Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.24,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bazargul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":708},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":729},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":772},{"due_date":"2015-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":795},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":818},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":842},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":866},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":891},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":917},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":944},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":968}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.13},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.51},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.73},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":12.39,"local_amount":708,"processed_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":742.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610751734},{"amount":12.76,"local_amount":729,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":764.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624799484},{"amount":13.13,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":786.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636161633},{"amount":13.51,"local_amount":772,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":809.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649514014},{"amount":13.91,"local_amount":795,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":833.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995790},{"amount":14.32,"local_amount":818,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":857.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291200},{"amount":14.73,"local_amount":842,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":882.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500419},{"amount":14.87,"local_amount":866,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":907.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"payment_id":711411370},{"amount":14.98,"local_amount":891,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":933.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.61,"payment_id":730933621},{"amount":14.7,"local_amount":917,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":961.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.35,"payment_id":752025645}],"funded_date":"2015-01-26T22:08:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":832433,"name":"Adil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adil is a 45-year-old man.

married and has three school-age children. He has a professional degree and has been farming and raising livestock since 2004. His hard work allowed Daniyar to own a herd of six cows and 50 sheep. He sells organic milk and also grows oats, potatoes and sainfoin(a feed plant) on his own land (6.66 hectares\/16.5 acres). The monthly farming income is 15,000 som (KGS). In order to expand the farm, Daniyar has turned to \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS) to buy feed and hay for his livestock. He plans to invest the profits from the loan to further expand his herd and save for the education of his kids.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":549.74,"image":{"id":1798878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase feed and hay for livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tepke village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-01-26T18:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-25T18:20:11Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.69,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniyar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3019},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2910},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2997},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3087},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3179},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3275},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3373},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3474},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3578},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3685},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3795},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3628}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.57},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.27},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.62},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.18},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.04},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100.06,"local_amount":5929,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5992.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624799485},{"amount":50.57,"local_amount":2997,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3029.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636161634},{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":3087,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3120.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649514015},{"amount":53.65,"local_amount":3179,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3213.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995791},{"amount":55.27,"local_amount":3275,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3310.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291201},{"amount":56.92,"local_amount":3373,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3409.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500420},{"amount":57.53,"local_amount":3474,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:04:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3511.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.09,"payment_id":711411371},{"amount":58.01,"local_amount":3578,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:58:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3616.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.37,"payment_id":730933622},{"amount":56.95,"local_amount":3685,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3724.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.23,"payment_id":752025646}],"funded_date":"2015-02-25T01:04:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":832356,"name":"Emelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emelyn is 49 years old, married and has four children, three still in school.\r\n\r\nEmelyn is in the agricultural business raising chickens in the Philippines.

","en":"Gulkaiyr has repaid her loan in full and she is very grateful to Kiva and all who lent her money. She now owns 3 cows, 24 sheep, 6 horses and 17 goats. Her monthly income is 8,500 som (KGS). The farm is flourishing, she has a lot of livestock and every year she puts up hay and feed for all of her animals. However, this year a terrible accident happened - her son, while goofing with friends, accidentally burned down two flat beds of her hay. The kids didn't get hurt, but now the animals have no food for the winter. Gulkaiyr had to turn to \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan of 65,000 som (KGS) to purchase feed for her livestock. She has already made a deal with the supplier, he will give her a discount on the price. This loan will help Gulkaiyr to save all of her livestock and make sure the newborn animals are healthy in the spring.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":372.31,"image":{"id":1799031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase feed hay for her livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Orto-Nura village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-01-26T18:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-25T18:20:11Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulkaiyr","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":22000},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":22000},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":21000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":372.31},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":372.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":372.31,"local_amount":22000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":22299.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291202}],"funded_date":"2015-02-22T08:22:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":832318,"name":"Ma.

She works hard to generate her own income and have financial stability. She owns a plot of agricultural land, where she seeds maize and nuts. She sells the harvested products at the local market. However, her income is seasonal and she finds it hard to cover all daily costs. She needs financial support to expand her agribusiness and make it more productive.\r\n \r\nTsiuri sought credit among local financial institutions, but her attempt was unsuccessful as the creditors didn't find enough family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. The start-up program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor people to start or re-start businesses.

She lived in Lincoln Heights for about four years before opening her studio and during that time she grew to love the people and energy in the community. There were no Pilates or yoga studios in the area and she saw so many people who could benefit from it, so she had the idea to bring Pilates to the neighborhood. Through teaching Pilates, Christina witnessed the power that movement and exercise can have on a person's life. Whether it is helping someone rebuild strength and mobility after an injury or training a client to help improve their overall fitness, it is very rewarding to help them reach their goals. Christina\u2019s hope is to share this with her community. The most popular services in the studio are private sessions and the Reform School reformer classes. With a Kiva loan, she will be able to purchase additional reformers to make more room in the classes that are quickly filling up. Her hope for the business is to make Pilates accessible for members of the Lincoln Heights community that may not otherwise be able to take a class. She plans to offer Pilates en Espanol for the Spanish speaking members of the community and teach classes out in the neighborhood to get people excited about Pilates and exercise in general.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2335.62,"image":{"id":1756229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Kiva

Karen actually worked with her brother in the same business in the Washington DC area and then decided to start a similar company to go after the LA market. After successfully starting the same business three years ago in the Washington DC area, this was the key moment that led to starting her own business. Karen is passionate about Document Imaging because she loves to help businesses become more efficient and she does things to help the environment. \n\nKaren\u2019s biggest challenge was talking to hundreds of companies and learning what customers really wanted.  Then she had to learn how to scale the service so she could deliver that service at an affordable price but still maintain high quality. With the Kiva funding, Karen intends to use the loan mostly for equipment and materials. Her first year goal is to get 12 customers and create a strong reference base to go after the medical community, which is still mostly paper based.\n\nThank you so much for supporting Scanergize.

With the financial support of the group loan, the seven women of the Trust Bank were able to invest in capital for their various business, which include the sale of flowers and vegetables, items for daily consumption, and agriculture. Due to their success and motivation for continued business and personal growth, all seven of the members of the Trust Bank have requested another loan with Friendship Bridge. \r\nIn the first loan cycle we told the story of Maria, a 26-year-old member of the Trust Bank, who had plans to join her brother in the expansion of their small store, investing in an inventory of kitchen items, clothing, and toys. While Maria was successful in repaying her loan with the income from the business shared with her brother, she is now requesting a new loan to establish her own business. Maria plans to start a business buying wholesale vegetables (onions, radishes, beans, etc.) from regional farmers and selling them for a profit in local markets. Maria believes that her new produce venture will give her independence and experience as a business owner. As she builds knowledge from experience and the monthly educational training from her Friendship Bridge loan officer delivered in Maria\u2019s native language of Kaqchikel, on topics including business administration, over-indebtedness and women\u2019s rights, she hopes to continue expanding her business and its profitability. Maria\u2019s goal is to build enough knowledge and capital to open a shoe store, an investment that will guarantee a steadier income. With the support of KIVA investors, Maria will be given the opportunity to become more independent and self-determining.\r\nThank you, KIVA lenders, for your continued support of Maria and the Trust Bank \u201cLas Mujeres Central La Cuchilla.\u201d With the loans provided by KIVA, Maria and her Trust Bank have the opportunity to determine their own futures and the futures of their families and community. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2542.5,"image":{"id":1800464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

A school and office supplies store is where one can buy school supplies, like pen, bond, photo paper, art paper, and the like, without going to a bookstore. She gets the supplies at wholesale prices and sells them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Aside from her store she also has photocopying services to serve students' school requirements at their area. She also has an E-load service.Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 700 in sales everyday.\n\nTo improve her profit, Rosalie is requesting for a PHP 10,000 loan which she will use to pay for school and office supplies such as pads, photo and bond paper, ink, notebooks and other supplies to sell at her store. She is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment and the financial aid that will be given her for it will surely help cover her family's household, personal needs and school needs of her child.\n\nRosalie hopes to sustain and grow her businesses to improve her living condition. She desires to give her child the best education until the college level. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1764835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for school and office supplies such bond and photo paper, notebooks, pad paper, pencils to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-01-26T22:10:25Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-25T22:10:25Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2687.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757399},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2687.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200537},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2687.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186819},{"amount":45,"local_amount":1999.96,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2015.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535851}],"funded_date":"2015-01-27T01:02:41Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Devashini Satiananden","image":401253}},{"id":822631,"name":"Familia R Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Margarita y Don Pedro est\u00e1n casados desde hace 36 a\u00f1os, tienen 11 hijos aunque actualmente ya s\u00f3lo uno depende de ellos.

They have 11 children, although only one of them is dependent on them now.  The couple lives in a very peaceful community where they preserve their customs and their native language.  The residents are very proud to belong to a culture with so much history, although they know that little by little, in time, some traditions are fading, so they try to keep on holding the most important celebrations to the extent they can, at home or with their neighbors.\r\n\r\nMargarita, or Mago as she's known affectionately, is 54 years old.  For 30 years she has worked raising calves.  She has two at home at the moment, but she's about to sell them.  That's why she needs a loan to invest in two more animals.  She hopes she earns enough profit to pay for the expenses of making repairs at her home.\r\n\r\nPedro also helps take care of the animals, although he has always worked in the field growing corn and, later, nopales that he sold door-to-door, in markets, and in small fairs in his community.  Currently he also sells sweets and beverages at an athletic field, but without neglecting to help Mago.\r\n\r\nMago and Pedro mentioned that one can achieve anything if there's a desire and enthusiasm.  In his case, he gets up very early to take care of the animals and later devotes a little time to the nopal business.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very grateful to VisionFund because I've been requesting loans for a lot of loan cycles now, and they helped up keep our jobs and get my other children ahead,\" said Mago.  Mago still dreams of having more animals, for which she hopes to have the VisionFund's support and get a loan for a bigger amount in the future.\r\n\r\nMargarita M. is also a member of the group.  She's the couple's daughter-in-law and she works at the same job.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in the community where the members live.

first loan from KIVA investors that they received in May of 2014. The success of the seven members of \u201cTzutujil\u201d in their first loan cycle has inspired them to apply for another loan with Friendship Bridge. With this loan the women of \u201cTzutujil\u201d will continue to take advantage of the increased tourism in their picturesque home of San Juan La Laguna bordering the beautiful Lake Atitlan. The complex and bright, traditional Maya \u201cTzutujil\u201d weavings that are hand-crafted and sold locally by the women of the Trust Bank, compliment the boundless natural beauty of the lakeshore.  \r\nMartha, a spirited woman with five children, is one of the artisans and members of the Trust Bank \u201cTzutujil.\u201d Martha plans to use her loan to buy thread and the materials used for natural dyeing for her textile business. In San Juan La Laguna, dried and ground achiote seeds or annatto, tree bark, charcoal and pomegranates, are all components of unique natural dye extraction techniques. With the loan, Martha will be able to apply her knowledge of natural dye extraction and textile weaving to create and sell beautiful woven fabrics. Martha, who has three years of business experience, is determined to use this loan to improve her quality of life and level of self-esteem.
