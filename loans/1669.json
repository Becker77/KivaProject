Her youngest son attends elementary school and lives with her; her eldest son lives independently. As the main source of income for her family, Suiumkan has been practicing livestock breeding for the past 10 years. She started this business with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Suiumkan's hard work, she currently has 18 sheep on her farm. Her average monthly income from this business is 9,000 som (KGS).

Kuria East sub-county, Kenya. Martha works as a commercial farmer for a living. Where Martha lives, the community does not have access to safe drinking water. The community collects their water from a local water spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. If Nyamwiharuri B community had a way to treat their drinking water, this could reduce the cases of water-borne diseases, keeping Nyamwiharuri B community at school and work.\n\nThis is why Martha is requesting a loan for a chlorine dispenser on behalf of her community. Martha was elected to represent her community as a volunteer promoter. She is not only representing her community on Kiva, but also volunteers her time to educate the people of her community on the importance of safe water and how to use the chlorine dispenser when they come to fetch water at their local water point. The loan will be used for the installation of the dispensers and the initial supplies of chlorine. Martha has volunteered to be a promoter because she envisions a community with clean, safe water. \n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Martha\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1798651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To ensure that the community has access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2015-01-26T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-25T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lukas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Protas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chacha ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-27T16:44:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":831546,"name":"Mujeres Unidas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo llamado Mujeres Unidas, est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero 14 del programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres, donde todas trabajan y se ayudan por salir adelante. \nEllas est\u00e1n haciendo la encuesta de eliminaci\u00f3n donde una de las integrantes es la Sra.

Gulsunai has received secondary education. Her neighbors speak warmly of her, describing her as a hard-working, optimistic and confident person. As a main source of income for her family, since 2010 Gulsunai has been raising livestock and growing farm produce. She has six cows and six horses on her farm. In addition, she has a 1.11 ha [2.7 acres] land plot, where she grows sainfoin [a plant used for animal feed] and corn. Thanks to Gulsunai's hard work, her farm now brings in about 10,000 KGS per month, which is used to cover the cost of food and everyday needs of her family. In order to develop her business further, Gulsunai has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 150,000 KGS to buy three cows. Gulsunai plans to use the revenue from her loan for an additional expansion of her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1262.5,"image":{"id":1799570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy three cows in order to increase her livestock headcount.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Noogardan village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-01-26T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-25T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.1,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulsunai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45000},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":505},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":757.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":505,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":30247.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649514017},{"amount":743.4,"local_amount":45000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":45371.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.1,"payment_id":711411373}],"funded_date":"2015-02-25T19:02:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":831787,"name":"Kasee","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kasee is a married man.

Joel is married, and together with his spouse they have been blessed with 2 boys, aged 2 and 5. In 2009, Joel started farming on the 3-acre piece of land he owns. \n\nThe land is fertile and close to the river from which he fetches water. On the farm he grows maize, and he also keeps 3 dairy cattle and 50 poultry. He has also grown trees on the farm because he believes such initiatives have a real impact on climate change.\n\nJoel is seeking a Kiva loan to purchase farm supplies for the agro-vet business he is running. He will use the loan investment to restock the business. He is an astute businessman whose primary focus is on the nature of the product that he offers to the market.

She is thankful to Kiva and to all the lenders who helped her get this financing.  She currently owns three dairy cows, one horse and 20 sheep.  She also grows beans and potatoes for resale on 1.2 hectare of land.  She makes an income of 4,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and also gets about 6,000 som (KGS) in remittances from her son.  Atyrkul lives with her second son, who helps her to run the farming business.  The family's total income is vastly insufficient for a decent living.

She is the profile member with her hand raised in the picture. She is also the representative of the group \u2018Hanna\u2019.  Her husband is an auto driver.  Most of the villagers are involved in weaving, selling vegetables and fruits, working as masons, etc. Ms Zamkhanniang runs a petty shop in her own place in order to help her husband in meeting the family household expenses. She has been running her petty shop for the past year to support her family. But the income she gets was not meeting her family household expenses. \r\n\r\nSince she had a one-year-old baby boy, she couldn\u2019t leave her baby for other work for more income so the only thing she could do along with her baby was to run the petty shop. Since her husband is an auto driver, she couldn\u2019t depend on him as his income isn\u2019t constant; it depends on the passengers he meets. So in order to earn more profit, she wanted to buy more stocks of items like pan, edible oil and other daily use items in order to earn more profits to support her family. \r\n\r\nShe had a hard time trying to figure out how to get the required money to buy the items for her shop. She tried to take loans from money lenders but to her surprise, the interest rates were too high for her so she couldn\u2019t take the loans. While she was in this dilemma, thinking what to do, she came across WSDS who provides loans at low interest rates. She was very much delighted as she could see her hope coming through with the help of a Kiva loan. She applied for the loan with the hope of buying stocks of daily use items in her shop to earn more income for her family's household maintenance. \r\n\r\nShe expresses her heartfelt gratitude to the funders and organizations of WSDS for their outstanding work in helping the needy people. She also wishes all the very best in their work. Likewise, the rest of the members too requested loans to start their income-generating activities."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1803046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase stocks of pan, edible oil, eatables and other useful items for the shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2015-01-27T07:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-26T07:30:07Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Niangzaching","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zamkhanniang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinghaukim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zamkhanniang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muankim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T13:24:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":832794,"name":"Istanoy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Istanoy is a wise woman.

Soon after her husband passed away, she became the head of the house. She had to take care of all the household activities and expenses, to earn for the family's household management and for paying her children's educational fees. \r\n\r\nSo she started selling readymade clothes at her residence and sometimes door to door. She had to be both a father and a mother to her children. She has been selling the readymade clothes for the past two years but the income she got was used for the family expenses and it wasn\u2019t enough to meet the family's requirements, and for a single mother to support three children with her meager income was very difficult. She was tense thinking what to do so that she would get enough income for her family. She felt very sad for not being able to meet the requirements of her children. She sometimes felt helpless as she was alone and trying to meet the family expenses. \r\n\r\nShe aspires to purchase more stocks of clothes to sell so that she can gain more income for her family. As clothes are one of basic necessities of human beings, they used to be in great demand. But her hope of buying more was not fulfilled as she didn't have the required income to do so.  She wanted to take loans thinking she would gain more, which would meet her family's requirements but she ended up not taking the loans as the interest rates were too high. With her Kiva loan, she aspires to buy more stocks of clothes to sell so that she can earn more income to meet her family's household expenses and pay her children's educational fees on time and at the same time, satisfy the customers. She thanks WSDS for their work of helping the needy by providing loans. Likewise, the rest of the members need and requested loans to start their respective income-generating activities."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1803060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase stocks of clothes (pajamas, shirts, sweaters, pants etc) to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2015-01-27T08:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-26T08:10:11Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sennu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kaineilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngaineikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haukhoching","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chongzatai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-20T07:32:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":832800,"name":"Mary Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Jane is a single woman with three children.

He has 4 children who are all adults now. This self-sacrificing man decided 30 years ago to work as a bricklayer in order to support his family. He is a veteran bricklayer on account of the many years he has been doing this work. As well as working in his own community he also goes out to neighbouring places. He has no other source of income and by working as a bricklayer he has been able to make an income and bring up his children. \r\n\r\nAs Julio says, a family's needs are never-ending, and for him one of the most urgent needs is to carry out improvements to his home. However, in order to carry out this project he first needs to buy building materials, and the main obstacle is that he does not have enough money to buy these materials. So he and his family have agreed to ask for a loan and he will pay this off with support from his children, since the children are able to help their father from their own small incomes. Julio's dream is to successfully complete this project so he can have a more comfortable house to live in."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1801251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy building materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2015-01-27T08:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-26T08:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julio Enrique ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":254.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624777114},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:07:05Z","rounded_local_amount":254.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636134424},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:07:35Z","rounded_local_amount":254.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649489529},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":254.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664971959},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:16:52Z","rounded_local_amount":254.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681267493},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:14:57Z","rounded_local_amount":254.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696477395},{"amount":199.98,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:17:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1528.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711384974}],"funded_date":"2015-02-18T09:03:44Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T12:17:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":831906,"name":"Apostol Santiago Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cAPOSTOL SANTIAGO\u201d iniciar\u00e1 el primer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Villa Exaltaci\u00f3n, est\u00e1 compuesta por ocho  integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Teodora es la Secretaria.

village in the Litein area of Kenya. Today, this humble mother sells milk, eggs, and a variety of food crops. She also does some side business (motorbike business) to supplement the meager income she earns from farming.\r\n\r\nShe is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has about farming, commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart, and she is proud to wake up every day to milk her cow. \r\n\r\nAlthough she makes profits by selling milk, she lacks a proper dairy unit and is seeking a loan to build one. \r\n\r\nA good dairy unit provides a place where cows can relax, and also prevents them from coming down with diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather such as rain. Rosemary believes that through this loan, her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save the money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit. \r\n\r\nRosemary thanks Kiva lenders for their support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":301.45,"image":{"id":1803130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To build a modern dairy unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-27T13:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-26T13:10:04Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.95,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.69,"local_amount":6105.69,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":6325.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265017},{"amount":31.63,"local_amount":2811.32,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2912.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459641},{"amount":35.01,"local_amount":3121.88,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3234.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.11,"payment_id":681378081},{"amount":73.35,"local_amount":6584.09,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:04Z","rounded_local_amount":6821.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.72,"payment_id":696587737},{"amount":90.82,"local_amount":8172.48,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:52Z","rounded_local_amount":8466.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.12,"payment_id":752111052}],"funded_date":"2015-01-27T23:25:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":832821,"name":"Rosalinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalinda is 58 years old and a married woman with four children.

And with the passing of time became more independent and opened his own shop, which thanks to God and in spite of difficulties has managed to get ahead with his family. <br \/><br \/>His biggest pride is having built his own house of wood where he lives now with his wife and 3 children. He made the furniture and almost everything you find in his humble house  he made. <br \/><br \/>He is requesting a loan to buy wood which will allow him to make more furniture and manage to obtain good profits from them. His big dream is focused on his children as they live in an area where education is almost a myth, where people who get ahead is because they learned themselves.

Meet Hellen from Litein, Kenya. She is a woman from a community not known for farming but she is earning a living through agriculture (Nandi community). She is happily married and together with her husband is blessed with a beautiful family. \r\n\r\nFor the past 8 years, she has been practicing mixed farming. Because of the experience she has, she commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers and is regarded as a mentor. Income from milk and eggs have allowed her to earn a decent income. To make extra money, Hellen engages in a small personal business. \r\n\r\nHellen passionately loves dairy farming and the animals on her farm have been given names. Milking and feeding her cows makes her very proud. Through milk selling, she has had quite good returns and the demand for milk has been expanding. Through extensive use of her mobile phone, she has been receiving orders from customers, then she can SMS her customers when the milk is ready for collection. Because of using information technology, she has had a comparative edge in her dairy business. Demand has been overwhelming and she needs another cow to fully satisfy the demand. She is requesting a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. \r\n\r\nHellen does not intend to buy just an ordinary cow but she wants to buy a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce rich creamy milk. The dairy cow will be producing between 10-20 litres of milk a day. The increased milk production will translate to more income and Hellen will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":228.88,"image":{"id":1803182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality breed of dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-27T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-26T14:10:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.91,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2096.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2187.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2251.23},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2317.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2384.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2454.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2526.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2599.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2675.98},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2754.18},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2834.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2917.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.22},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.13},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.07},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.06,"local_amount":4719.72,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5060.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265020},{"amount":56.23,"local_amount":4819.66,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5167.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459644},{"amount":57.18,"local_amount":4959.35,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5317.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.68,"payment_id":696587739},{"amount":58.5,"local_amount":5119.95,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5489.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.23,"payment_id":731022865}],"funded_date":"2015-01-27T16:49:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Grantham","image":456803}},{"id":832832,"name":"Leonida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonida is a 53 years old mother who has four adult-age children.

Meet Annah, a 65-year-old youthful, very hardworking, honest, and ever-smiling mother. She lives with her husband in a remote village in Litein, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. \r\n\r\nAnnah passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past ten years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding her large family requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her large family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. \r\n\r\nAnnah has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and the price of milk in the recent past has been going up, so Annah, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learned that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nAnnah said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agriculture-based loans and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from the training, she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro-finance institutions. Annah hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children. She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":142.99,"image":{"id":1803210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-27T14:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-26T14:30:11Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.23,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.34,"local_amount":3052.84,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265021},{"amount":33.54,"local_amount":2981.75,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3082.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459645},{"amount":36.55,"local_amount":3288.26,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3399.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.44,"payment_id":696587740},{"amount":37.33,"local_amount":3388.25,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3503.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.79,"payment_id":731022866}],"funded_date":"2015-01-27T15:41:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":831914,"name":"Maria Mariana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Maria es una mujer de 48 a\u00f1os de edad muy luchadora quien agradece los diferentes apoyos financieros que ha recibido desde Octubre del 2013 para poder dar asistencia y mantenimiento a sus cultivos de caf\u00e9.

He is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in his village because of his resilience despite personal challenges and his passion to support his siblings and family as a primary caregiver. The living conditions in the Kapsowar area are very tough and you need to have tough skin in order to survive. Philemon has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. \r\n\r\nBecause of the hardcore poverty in his village, Philemon started practicing mixed farming and has been doing it for the past 5 years. Philemon\u2019s sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg selling; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, and one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. The Kapsowar area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Philemon is kindly seeking a loan to buy another motorbike.

This job allows her to earn income to support her family, because she's in a common-law relationship and has one child.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer she says the institution's health offerings and training.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of one of the clients is in the photo, wearing a blue sweater; she wanted to participate in the group."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1801309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy an industrial blender","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2015-01-27T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-26T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nieves Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cesar Josue","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viriginia Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yorsely\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grecia\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":13576,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2022.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2168.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2227.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2288.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2351.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2517.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":319.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":346.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":297.89,"local_amount":2022.05,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:40:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2043.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624239307},{"amount":319.51,"local_amount":2168.84,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:11:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2191.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636607064},{"amount":328.22,"local_amount":2227.92,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-23T12:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2251.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650950322},{"amount":337.12,"local_amount":2288.4,"processed_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2312.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665057720},{"amount":346.36,"local_amount":2351.12,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:07:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2376.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681355579},{"amount":370.9,"local_amount":2517.67,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2544.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696565811}],"funded_date":"2015-01-29T16:50:56Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T14:09:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":831944,"name":"Amigas De Puerto Perez I Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cAMIGAS DE PUERTO PEREZ I\u201d iniciar\u00e1 el primer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Copacabana, est\u00e1 compuesta por nueve  integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Vanesa es la Presidenta.

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t ever seen my father. When I was 7 years old, my mother got married again. She and my stepfather have 3 more children. Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t find a common language that they divorced. This case so weakened our financial situation, as my mother hasn\u2019t worked after giving birth to my last sibling. Of course, my step-father pays alimony for his children, but it\u2019s so difficult to my mother physically and morally to raise 4 children by herself. I am the eldest one, my 10-year-old brother studies at school and 5-year-old sister goes to the kindergarten. The youngest sibling is at home with mother, who is a house-wife. Everything gets expensive day by day and we get more financially dependent from our grandparents. They are pensioners, who love us very much and do their best to assist my mother.\r\n\r\nI was an active student at school and used to take part in every extra-curricular activity. AUCA also gives me a chance to show my abilities in singing, dancing, debates and games. There are a lot of advantages of AUCA:  one of them is an opportunity to continue studying abroad. Most of AUCA graduates get their Masters at American and Western universities, Diploma of which guarantees good perspectives in career and encourages them to grow personally and in society.\r\n\r\nFor some students a Kiva loan is a way to help their parents to pay their university tuition and I am not an exception. I don\u2019t know how to help my mother in other way, but I am sure that receiving education at AUCA I will be useful for my siblings, my mother and totally for my Motherland. I greatly appreciate lenders\u2019 trust and their help to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1803304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

is 34 years old, married with three children and hails from Apac district in Northern Uganda. Having finished his Junior High equivalent, he dropped out of school due to a lack of school fees and moved to the city, where he was employed as a supervisor at a steel factory. He later moved back to the village to engage in farming before returning to the city selling eggs and working as a used car salesman.\r\n\r\nIt was at this stage that he met his cousin Denish, a Micro Entrepreneur with UpEnergy Uganda Ltd who introduced him to the business of selling improved cook stoves. Nickson has been selling cook stoves for the last two years in partnership with UpEnergy.\r\n\r\nBy working with UpEnergy, Nickson has been able to earn extra income and pay for his children\u2019s tuition fees. It has also enabled him to start the construction of his own house in his native village. Nickson's favourite part about working with UpEnergy is that they provide unique life changing products for the community, which significantly improves their livelihoods.\r\n\r\nHe knows that through using energy efficient cook stoves, end-users reduce deforestation and save money by consuming less fuel. Nickson's aspiration in life is to build a small house for his family in the city, enable his children to get a good education and to live a better life.  \r\n\r\nThe Kiva loan will enable Nickson to increase his stock levels thus reducing the time and costs spent moving back and forth to replenish his stock. A portion of the loan will also go towards leasing a storage facility for his products. Furthermore, Nickson will use the loan to purchase marketing materials that will help him to increase sales. These basic steps will enable Nickson to grow his business substantially.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2875,"image":{"id":1803301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Innovative Loans","Green"],"use":"to increase his stock, lease a storage facility, and purchase marketing materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":290,"posted_date":"2015-01-27T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-26T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":2875,"lender_count":81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":51.3,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nickson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":8160000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6985000},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235000},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235000},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235000},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235000},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2461.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2461.01,"local_amount":6985000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:01:06Z","rounded_local_amount":7038499.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649751766},{"amount":220.76,"local_amount":705000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":710399.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.64,"payment_id":696753297},{"amount":71.02,"local_amount":235000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":236799.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.78,"payment_id":711685234},{"amount":70.91,"local_amount":235000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-02T13:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":236799.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.88,"payment_id":731189421}],"funded_date":"2015-02-17T16:45:38Z","paid_date":"2015-12-02T13:10:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":832887,"name":"Agnes's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is 50 years old and has eight children.

She is blessed with a lovely family, and has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. On her farm, she grows maize, and she raises a dairy cow and poultry. She sells milk, eggs, and maize. To meet her expenses and provide the best for her family, she often engages in small personal businesses to make extra money. However, farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction, despite meager earnings. Gladys says, \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. For a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Gladys formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance organization that supports small rural farmers. \r\n\r\nShe acquired a dairy cow that she later named Mrembo (Swahili for \"beautiful\"). The cow produces milk daily, which Gladys sells to a co-operative. \"The money from milk comes regularly and is not very affected by sudden changes in weather if you have stored feed,\" said Gladys. The money Gladys got from selling the milk was adequate to repay the loan. \r\n\r\nToday, Gladys is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy cow because she is planning to become a full-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. With this loan, Gladys is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, good health and livelihood. Gladys patiently waits for your

The community of Kokelo village collects their drinking water from Kajosi well because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Kokelo\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. In Kokelo, 30 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Joyce has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water in order to keep themselves and their families healthy. There are 3 other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Jackline, Zakayo and Samwel.\n\nKokelo village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser.

The community of Rebui village collects their drinking water from a local well because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Rebui\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser program offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. Rebui community will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Joseph has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water in order to keep themselves and their families healthy. There are 3 other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Moses, Celine and Mary.\n\nRebui community needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Joseph believes that the dispenser will reduce water-borne diseases in his community. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Joseph\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1803483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To ensure that the community has access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2015-01-27T18:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-26T18:30:18Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T13:07:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":831189,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"refunded","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

Eva ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her students concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1680,"image":{"id":1803222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mpigi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.083333 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-01-27T18:30:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-26T18:30:19Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":105,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":62.81,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Destiny Schools","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":7995000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1599000},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1599000},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1599000},{"due_date":"2016-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1599000},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1599000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":560},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":560},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":560},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":560},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":560}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":560,"local_amount":1599000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:58:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1601599.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636256969},{"amount":531.45,"local_amount":1599000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1601599.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28.55,"payment_id":681370838},{"amount":525.74,"local_amount":1599000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:11:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1601599.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":34.26,"payment_id":755507113}],"funded_date":"2015-01-27T21:21:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":832926,"name":"Chichek","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chichek is 45 years old.

Thomas lives with his beautiful wife in Kapsowar, a small rural town in Kenya. The Kapsowar area is also referred to as the mango region of Kenya because half the mangoes consumed are from that region. He has been farming for the past five years and has never looked back. To earn a decent and honest living, he sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. <br \/><br \/>Thomas is satisfied with the returns he gets through farming. However, he wants to diversify and start horticulture farming. The main challenge he faces is accessing funds. He is kindly requesting a loan to start horticulture farming.

Justine also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Justine's Group will be able to receive a total of four solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 4.5 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1747459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-01-27T18:50:36Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-26T18:50:36Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine V","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anjelyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fridah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":68300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-28T15:19:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":831229,"name":"Nyange","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nyange is a married man and has five school-going children.

He is considered a pacesetter when it comes to farming in his village of Bosamaro in the Kapsowar area of Kenya. Having done mixed farming for the past five years, he has gained much experience and he offers free extension services to young upcoming farmers. Richard is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. Richard enjoys generating income from selling milk, his harvest, and produce from his farm. He finds dairy farming very fulfilling but the main challenge he faces is not being able to properly feed his dairy cows. He is seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter. Through the loan, he will be able to cut hay into small pieces before mixing it with other forage to feed his cattle. The chaff cutter will aid his cattle in digestion and will prevent his dairy cattle from rejecting any part of their food. Proper feeding of cattle is one of the most important factors in maintaining a high yield in the production of milk. Through proper feeding, his cow will produce more milk and this will translate to more profits and improved living standards. When he was asked how this loan will benefit his family, Richard said \u201cmore income.\u201d Profits from the loan will be used in fully repaying the loan and improving the living standard for his parents and family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":448.69,"image":{"id":1803372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a chaff cutter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-27T19:10:26Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-26T19:10:26Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.52,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.85,"local_amount":8772.75,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":8992.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601209},{"amount":55.39,"local_amount":4966.31,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5090.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459652},{"amount":57.73,"local_amount":5201.64,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:21Z","rounded_local_amount":5331.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.29,"payment_id":681378083},{"amount":53.83,"local_amount":4884.7,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5007.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.65,"payment_id":696587747},{"amount":57.96,"local_amount":5417.01,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":5552.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.46,"payment_id":711506057},{"amount":58.07,"local_amount":5315.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5448.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.22,"payment_id":731022872},{"amount":62.34,"local_amount":5669.64,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5811.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.9,"payment_id":752111057}],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T23:27:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":831249,"name":"Chizi.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chizi is a married woman and has been blessed with three kids who attend school.

That will be achieved through the financial support she requested from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua, so that she may now start her own accessories and cosmetics selling business from her house, which will increase her family's income and improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nMaha is the lady at the far left side of the picture. As for the other group members, Rawaa is the lady at the center (married, one child); she has been working in accessories for two years, and her requested loan will be used to pay for necessary legal issues. \r\n\r\nAs for Asma, at the far right (married, 4 children), who has been working in the beauty business from her house for 23 years, her acquired loan will be invested in developing her business through special winter beauty products.

In this way, Gonzalo is satisfying his needs. Gonzalo's two sons work as masons, and his two daughters carry out domestic work. With his children's income he has been able to achieve some goals, but Gonzalo still has some additional plans to improve his family's quality of life. Currently, Gonzalo needs to do finishing work on a construction project he has carried out. Because of this work, he is seeking a loan in order to finish part of the improvements to his home. \r\n \r\nHis children will contribute along with the income Gonzalo generates in order to make the loan payments.

Meet Linah, a 41-year-old, very hardworking, honest, and ever-smiling mother. She lives with her husband in the lush hills of Kapsowar, in the rift valley region of Kenya. \r\n\r\nLinah passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past eight years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding the large family she has requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her large family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. \r\n\r\nLinah has identified a free space in her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices in the recent past have been going up, so Linah, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learns that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nLinah said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural-based loans and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo and from the training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. \r\n\r\nLinah hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children. She awaits your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":299.73,"image":{"id":1803385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-27T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-26T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Linah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":42400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3000.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3088.47},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3178.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3271.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3367.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3465.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.93},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3671.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3778.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3888.89},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4002.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4119.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.48,"local_amount":5844.52,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":6017.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601210},{"amount":37,"local_amount":3302.89,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3400.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459653},{"amount":35.84,"local_amount":3215.43,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3310.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.18,"payment_id":681378084},{"amount":38.53,"local_amount":3480.69,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3583.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.46,"payment_id":696587748},{"amount":38.71,"local_amount":3601.5,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3707.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.64,"payment_id":711506058},{"amount":80.73,"local_amount":7310.11,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":7526.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.16,"payment_id":752111058}],"funded_date":"2015-01-28T02:16:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tom D"}},{"id":832967,"name":"Tasleem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tasleem, aged 55 years, is a married woman with 5 children.

She earns a minimum net income of 1,000 PHP each day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, Jennifer is requesting a 19,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as sacks of rice, canned goods, and soda. She is positive that the loan will help boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. \r\n\r\nThe income from her store helps a lot in their daily sustenance. Jennifer hopes to maintain and grow her business for a prosperous life. She prays for a victorious and happy family.

A loan of 2,500 USD will be a great support to this hardworking woman and her family, enabling her to purchase three oxen, forage for feeding the livestock and fertilizer, and to cover land cultivation costs. \r\n\r\nAs this is Sonya's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before because they have no credit history.

","en":"Zhannat is 38 years old, married, and the mother of five school-age children.  She is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities that provide an additional source of income for her family.  Thanks to her very hard work, she has come to a point where she now makes a monthly income of about 15,000 som (KGS), which is used to cover the family's food expenses and other daily needs.  Zhannat's farming business also includes 0.25 hectare of land on which she grows raspberries.  Recently, Zhannat sold two steers and six sheep and used the money from the sale of these animals to buy a car for her family.  She has decided to once again increase her livestock headcount and has turned to Bai Tushum for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy a couple of steers as well as feed for her livestock.  She is planning to reinvest the earnings from her loan into further expanding her farming business, and in the long-term, rebuild the barn where she keeps her farm animals.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1256.25,"image":{"id":1790664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock feed, as well as two steers for fattening and resale.

children.  For the past 10 years, she has been running her own farming business, and this activity provides her family with its main source of income.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently owns two cows, 30 sheep and one horse.  She also grows barley for resale on 0.92 hectare of land.  She makes a monthly income of about 20,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her farming business, Gulmira has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS).

follow industrialized conventional production. What they have is access to land, farmyard manure, and manpower,\u201d Philip says. What they are missing, he says, is the know-how to create a productive farm. \u201cThe biggest aspect that is missing in this sector is information.\u201d \r\n\r\nPhilip and his wife have worked on their current farm, situated in the outskirts of Litein town, Kenya, since 2008. Since then, their farm and family have grown in more ways than one. In 2008, the couple started working on a run-down farm. Today, they are making money off the poultry and dairy animals they raise, and also the tea and vegetables they grow. Philip has further invested in transportation services to reduce their transportation costs, and make money offering the service to other farmers. \r\n\r\nPhilip loves to dairy farm, especially since it was always a life goal of his to be a farmer. His wife understands this, and together they joined hearts and hands to make the farm\u2019s success to date happen. \r\n\r\nPhilip is seeking a loan to purchase a pedigree dairy cow. There are more than 100 cattle breeds in Kenya. However, not all are good producers of milk. In fact, very few are. Cattle aside, the tastes and preferences of milk in the market is really growing diverse in Kenya. Taking milk is no longer a matter of pouring it into our cereal bowl, adding it to our coffee, or drinking it straight from the glass; we now have preferences in the type of milk we drink. \r\n\r\nToday, milk consumers are spoiled for choice: in the market, we have old-fashioned cow\u2019s milk and lactose-free milk, not to mention non-dairy options such as soy, almond, rice and coconut milk. It takes dairy masters like Philip to pick these shifts in the market and adopt ingenious techniques in farming to ensure that their product qualities adapt to the changes in consumer preference. Purchasing a pedigree cow goes to show how Philip is keen on controlling lameness levels in his dairy cattle. He considers breeding to be the core of his overall strategy of ensuring that milk quantity is way above average and the milk quality is second to none in the market. \r\n\r\nHe anticipates that feeding will be his highest cost of milk production. This, to him, is accepted because to get cows that milk well and remain healthy, they have to be fed properly. Your loan will make a significant difference to Philip's farm profitability.

He has pensioner parents, a wife, a daughter and a son. His children are temporarily unemployed and the only source of income for this six-members family is from agricultural activity. Aslan and his wife work on family-owned land, where they cultivate nuts and mandarins. They use the harvested products for local trading. Also, the family owns one cattle and milking cow and uses its products for feeding the family and also for local trading.\r\n \r\nConsequently, Aslan generates seasonal income and has a great desire to do more stable business activities on his own. That's why he requested a loan to local financial institutions for starting to work on a bus line. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program makes possible provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Aslan plans to buy a mini-bus and start serving local people.
