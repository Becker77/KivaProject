She has one child, and her husband works in a hospital in the capital, where he works in the storeroom, and he prepares nutritious food in the kitchen.  Maria used to rise early in the mornings to make her tortillas since she went out walking to sell them on the sidewalks in Managua.  She gave up her cereal and tortilla sales to work for a company called Telmark Nicaragua.  Her sales were going down, so she decided to look for work at Telmark, where they gave her a job as a janitor since they knew her.  This was a great opportunity for her since she now has a fixed salary.  But she keeps making cereal, which her coworkers buy.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she will purchase construction materials to build at least a side wall on her house, so she can close the house up little by little and have a little more security, since there is a lot of delinquency in her neighborhood.  So she needs the wall for greater security.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":487792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of construction materials such as: stone, sand, cement and iron to build a side wall on her home for security","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-02-14T05:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.38,"local_amount":667.57,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:04Z","rounded_local_amount":699.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604510},{"amount":172.7,"local_amount":3454.03,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3618.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639981},{"amount":27.25,"local_amount":545.09,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":571.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330300},{"amount":2.95,"local_amount":59,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":61.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465464},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":687.34,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":720.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097644},{"amount":46.39,"local_amount":927.87,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:39Z","rounded_local_amount":972.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348304},{"amount":42.96,"local_amount":859.29,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:06:50Z","rounded_local_amount":900.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195765993},{"amount":40,"local_amount":799.81,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":838,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209122}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T12:58:04Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":180089,"name":"Sorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sorn Y. is 36 years old and is a resident of Kampong Chhnang province, located about 90 km from the capital, Phnom Penh.

Akbarali is an active 38-year-old father. He is a talented farmer and his crops are sought after by many local women who would like to sell them. The income he earns from this business allows him to take care of his large family of four children and his wife. Akbarali would like to increase his harvest in order to maximize his income, and to do so he needs to buy fertilizer, fuels and lubricants. As he lacks the financial means to do so, Akbarali is requesting a loan of 7000 Somoni to help him with this purchase.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

By working hard in her Eatery and oyster vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12000. Gleceria is borrowing PHP 19000 so that she may fund operations of her eatery and oyster vending businesses. This will be her 9th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Gleceria aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nOlivia dreams of being able to renovate her house soon with all of her work with the business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family, especially in meeting their basic needs, savings for future use, loan repayments, children\u2019s education and possible business expansions.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n About PMPC:\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been married for seven years to Miguel, who is a surveyor.\r\n\r\nAs Don Miguel has stable work, Do\u00f1a Yahaira previously stayed at home taking care of the children.  As they grew up, she decided, together with her husband, to start a business to earn another source of income for the family.  She opened a food stall close to a school in the village, and this is where she sells all types of confectionery for children.  She sells churros (dough fritters), sweets, water, gum and paletas (popsicles).  Her food stall opens at five in the morning, and remains open until 5 in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nYahaira has requested her first loan of L4,000 for the purchase of products such as gum, fruit and churros to stock up her business.

from Tanzania! Lailaty is a 51-year-old single woman with four children, two of whom are in school. She is a new entrepreneur who started a Mama Lishe, or local caf\u00e9, in 2007 where she serves delicious cuisine to her customers. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that actually entails. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. \r\n<p>Lailaty\u2019s monthly profit from the caf\u00e9, where her children and two employees assist her, is approximately $US300. She is requesting a loan of $US275 in order to purchase more stocks of rice as well as additional chairs and tables to accommodate more customers. In the future, she hopes to further expand her caf\u00e9.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional foodstuffs and seating","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-18T01:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lailaty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-01T15:40:17Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":32424,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":344466},{"amount":27,"local_amount":29454.55,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":31266,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347922},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:05Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970496},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886713},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435973},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130274},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027105},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:35Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613145},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:59:48Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010228},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232539}],"funded_date":"2008-08-18T15:40:17Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":64729,"name":"Heng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Heng P., 49, and his wife, Mrs. Samet Roen, 48, who live in a small village across Mekong River about fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh, have been married for twenty years and have seven children; two sons and five daughters.

worked in the past as a president of a small local government organization. He is 66 years old, married and has raised six children. All of his children already have their own families and everyone besides his youngest son live separately from parents.

Her business helps her community because she provides affordable food for people.\r\n<p>\r\nKiria feels that her loans through GHAPE have benefited her because the method of repayment is comfortable and convenient, and because GHAPE provides training as well as proper follow-up after the loan is disbursed to ensure that the loan is properly managed. \r\n<p>  \r\nAbout GHAPE\r\n<p>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

They have come to SMT\/Shine on Sierra Leone to seek a loan of 6,000,000 Sierra Leonean Leones for a number of reasons. As teachers\u2019 salaries are usually small, SMT\/Shine on Sierra Leone loans are very useful in helping them supplement their salaries.\r\n\r\nThis will be the first loan these teachers are accessing from SMT\/Shine on Sierra Leone and Kiva. Like most teachers in Sierra Leone, the members of this group rarely have extra income with which they can buy or do anything great. But with a loan, they can now buy or do something big and then repay over a period of time.\r\n\r\nSome of them will use their loan to begin or continue building a house, others to pay either for themselves to pursue further studies or pay for their children\u2019s education. Some will use it to invest in businesses in order to supplement their monthly salaries and still others will use theirs to buy pieces of furniture and household goods.\r\n\r\nThe leader of this group of teachers is Samuel A. T.. He is a senior teacher at the school and has been in the teaching profession for thirty-one years now. Samuel is about forty-five years old and married with four children and one foster child. Two of his children are in Junior Secondary School II, the others are not of school going age, and his foster child is in primary school II.\r\n\r\nSamuel will use this loan to buy house-building

Bayanzurh district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. She and her family live together in a ger, the Mongolian nomadic tent, in a rented plot of land with a yard. Togoosuren pays 20,000 tugrugs (about $14 US) per month in rent. She and her family have been living in their current home for five years. \r\n\r\nTogoosuren started her scarf weaving and cashmere\/camel wool\/yak hair sweater business at her home in 2004.  Originally, she would weave by hand, but she has been using two weaving machines for the business recently.

Her desire to give her children love and the best education motivated her to become a GHAPE member in 2007.  Her past loan investments are still yielding good dividends. She plans to invest this loan in the purchase of beans, palm oil, groundnuts and yams.

The group consists of 11 members, all from the same neighbourhood, from which the Banc Villageois took its name.\r\n\r\nIt is a very closely knit and supportive group, which regularly holds consultation and exchange meetings to ensure the good functioning of their businesses. It is a homogeneous group of married women, mothers of at least three children.\r\n\r\nThey are very resourceful in commercial matters, diversifying their activities: some sell incense, others seafood products, beauty products, or clothing fabrics.\r\n\r\nThe president, Mrs Fatou T., seen at the far right in the picture, wearing a red, gray and yellow square-patterned ensemble, is 45 years old. She is a very dynamic woman, who nurtures a spirit of solidarity and mutual aid within the group. She is quite strict and strong-willed and doesn\u2019t spare any efforts to maintain the good functioning of the group and the success of their business activities.\r\n\r\nShe retails clothing apparel and beauty products. She gets her supplies from Dakar, the capital of Senegal, for resale on credit in her neighbourhood. She recovers her loan payments at the end of each month. Her objective is to support her husband with their children\u2019s nourishment and education.\r\n\r\nAlthough the group only existed six months within the CAURIE-MF MFI, their members had prior experience with credit loans over the past five years. This has given them a solid commercial sense, ensuring that their first loan was reimbursed without problems, and also sustaining a good level of savings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French

He is the most experienced bricklayer to whom his neighbors come when there is a need for roofing or building of a wall.  Hernan enjoys working in construction and knows that this noble profession will enable him to pay for the education of his children.  He wants to buy more beams and struts to be able to improve his construction projects and thus improve his income.\r\nThe difficult part of his work is carrying the heavy bricks and having to handle the cement at times even with his hands. This has caused his hands to age rapidly, but has not taken away their strength nor the desire to get ahead that he carries inside him.  This is his fourth loan with MFP and he does not want to stop paying on it due to lack of money, so he is already signing more contracts for construction work. He is the only male in his community bank and always tries to be responsible and respectful with the other members.  With the money from the loan he will buy new beams and will increase the number of struts, which will allow him to work in more construction projects and improve his income<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Bobbit, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":272804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of necessary supplies for his work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T02:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hernan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:36:16Z","rounded_local_amount":134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117090},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:28Z","rounded_local_amount":134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012003},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595588},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989850},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210986},{"amount":42.2,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":136.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640487}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T04:01:28Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Bobbit","image":null}},{"id":93431,"name":"Ronaldo Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Ronaldo G. es muy trabajador por la raz\u00f3n de que se dedica a su actividad de elaboraci\u00f3n de canastos y otros objetos derivados del bamb\u00fa.

This is 35-year-old Sekela M. from Kyela. She is single with one child, age 12. Sekela has been running a crops-selling business since 2001. A typical maize business is a stand on the side of the road where maize is often piled high in baskets.  Customers can scrutinize the quality of the product before purchase and specify the exact amount they would like to purchase. Maize is very important to the Tanzanian culture as maize is used to make one of their staple dishes, ugali. Ugali is made solely of maize flour and water.\nShe works at the business for 9 - 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Sekela currently earns about 130USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase more beans in bulk. In the future, she plans to establish another business. Sekela thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more beans in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sekela S.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She hoped that someday through loans requested from ASHI, she would be able to have an established business to support her in bringing her family out of the umbrella of poverty.  She and her husband started cultivating a small parcel of land in their backyard, growing rice and vegetables to sell. They were both very familiar with this occupation from childhood, having learned the skills from their farmer parents. After receiving several loans since joining ASHI, their business eventually improved, as did the quality of their family life. Using her profit, Maria was able to send her two children to a vocational course in college and has been supporting the needs of her eldest child, who is unemployed due to his limited education. \r\n\r\nSince farming is the main source of Maria\u2019s financial need to support her dream of improving her family's standard of living, she hopes to make it sustainable and profitable. With more capital, she plans to purchase equipment, a variety of vegetable seedlings, and a better variety of rice seedlings to increase her sales turnover and profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n

The reason  for her kiva loan request, her sixth loan, is the desire to purchase a hot dog cart and supplies for her new products such as sausages, sauces, flour and also soft drinks.\r\n\r\nIlsy allocates her time well to each activity.  Every day she fries the arepas, empanadas and cariba\u00f1olas (yucca stuffed with meat) which are her breakfast options.  She makes the cakes on the weekends allowing the families to rest and not cook and soon she will diversify her offerings by adding fast foods which have a higher sales level on the weekend evenings from Friday to Sunday and on holidays.  Since Ilsy T. started as a client of the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, she has improved her income, her business has grown which has allowed her to improve the quality of education of her two children, 7 and 12 years of age.  Her goals are focused on further growing her business, especially having a space with a structure that befits her activity of making food.  She is very fortunate in terms of her location as she lives in the Las Nieves neighborhood, a community that maintains the happy profile of the people of Barranquillera which attracts customers during festivities and recreational events and strengthens her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Bobbit, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":605446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of hot dog cart and raw materials for her new products such as sausages,sauces, flour and refreshments.

is pleased to present to you teachers of the Kulafai Rashedeen Primary School, Mafuki village, 3 miles to Lunsar, a town in northern Sierra Leone. This school was founded in 1982 by the Kulafai Rashedeen Mission. The school is currently staffed with 37 teachers and has an enrollment of 550 pupils. This is the first loan that teachers of this institution have benefited from Kiva lenders. \n\nEdward F. is a teacher at the school and leader of this group. Edward is approximately forty year old and was born in Lunsar, in northern Sierra Leone. He has been in the teaching profession for fourteen years now. Edward is married and has four children. He has requested for a loan of SLL 800,000.00 in order to invest in business. Edward will buy locally produce goods like palm-oil and rice at large quantity for sale. \n\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish some certain tasks that they would otherwise have not been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":714682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buys locally produce goods like palm-oil and rice at large quantity for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Lunsar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2011-03-11T05:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2575,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edward \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohamed S.

It should be said that the business group Farijika consists primarily of women.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":779758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy four baskets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

However, her life wasn't always filled with joy because there were times when she didn't have customers.

Because of that, she was only able to attend school until the fifth grade, but despite that Rocio works every day to get ahead.\r\n\r\nAfter a lot of hard work and saving, Rocio was able to start her business selling breakfasts.  She starts her work at four in the morning, as at that time there are a lot of people waiting to take the bus to work on farms and most of them have not had breakfast.  That is why Rocio offers them her delicious dishes and she can serve up to 25 customers per day.  She believes that she is getting ahead with her business because she is very nice to her customers and above all because everything is very well seasoned.\r\n\r\nRocio is very thankful to Kiva's lenders as it is thanks to the help they have offered her that she will be able to buy a freezer to preserve her ingredients better, such as vegetables and meat, so she will not have to buy them every day.

The size of her client base has become so large that it is almost impossible for her to keep up with the ever-growing demand, due to a lack of financial means. In order to do so, she took out her first loan in 2007 for 50,000 francs, which allowed her to stock up sufficiently. The experience was very profitable for her because her capital was increased.

G. is 24 years old, married and has two children.

He is experienced in marketing dried apricots; he purchases apricots from local farmers at wholesale, then processes them for sale to his customers.

Bobogoib would like to express his gratitude to everyone supporting him.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan: \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the northeastern boundary of Alexander the Great's empire. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet and Western cultures and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While Tajikistan is working to improve its agricultural productivity and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services. Funds raised through Kiva have already been, and will continue to be, distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients.

To make a living, Analyn owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock.

Analyn has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Analyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Analyn is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Analyn from ASKI.

Rosa lives in her own home with her 30-year-old partner and their 8-year-old daughter named Daysi, who is the reason behind all of her efforts.  The hard work put forth by Edith and her partner on their farm have resulted in crops that receive excellent care.  When it comes time to sell, their products are bought up very quickly.  Her main source of income comes from the sale of cacao, coffee, and bananas.  In total, she has three plots of land.  Edith sells her crops in the city of San Francisco.  During harvest time, she hires laborers so that the work can be completed faster.  What she enjoys most about her work is harvesting because this is the time when she sees the fruits of her labor.  Edith has been farming for eight years and considers the most difficult part to be protecting her crops against plagues of insects that can attack the shoots of her plants.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan to buy insecticides to combat these plague of insects.

She lives in her own home beside 7 people, among whom are her siblings and their children. She works very hard every day to improve her income and have a better quality of life. Mirlith\u2019s work consists of selling soft drinks which she buys in bulk from wholesalers and she then sells them on when they are freezing cold.\r\n\r\nThe heat in the area in which she lives makes her customers come to her house very often as she sells the coldest drinks on her block. Her business is very good and she has spent approximately four years working at it by herself.

One reason is the villagers have very little means, so they only buy basic necessities or very inexpensive luxuries, i.e. sodas and cosmetics. And the other reason is the owners of the businesses are also without means, so they cannot afford to take risks on items which may not sell. So, the safest course is to copy what other stores sell. One diversifies by having a well-stocked store and developing a loyal clientele.

He resides in Bayan-Olgii province, one of Mongolia's western provinces, with his children and wife. Three of his four children are secondary school students; the fourth is a 1-month-old baby, for whom Serjan's wife stays home to care. \r\n\r\nSerjan has been engaged in small businesses since 2005. He started with a clothing retail business and subsequently switched to a fuel retail business in 2008. He purchases fuel from fuel-trucks that pass through his town to carry fuel from Russia to Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. He purchases the fuel at a lower price and then sells it to local car owners at a lower price than local fuel stations. Since he offers a better rate than local fuel stations, he receives fuel orders from his customers in advance. Additionally, he repairs broken cars and sells them at profit and runs a small chicken farm at home. His wife takes care of the chicken farm and sells the eggs in local stores. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan so that he can purchase some feed for his chicken farm and have more capital with which to purchase fuel for his customers' orders.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank:\r\n\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009. It is the largest microfinance organization in Mongolia; additionally, it has mainstream commercial operations.

Tajikistan has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have the opportunity to have a viable business. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a resident of Maquilao, Tangub City. She and her husband have been blessed with eight children who are now teenagers. Her husband is a driver of motorcycles for hire with an average net income of not less than P150 a day. To help her husband in raising their children, she decided to start a business, and opened up a little dried fish-selling shop in their barangay. For a year, she has been able to maintain this business and has been able to purchase stock for her business. At this time, she is earning an average net income of not less than P1500 a month, which amount is very helpful for their family.\r\n<p>\r\nShe joined PAGLAUM MPC two years ago because she is very much interested in our products and services. As a first-time borrower with an excellent credit record, she was allowed to borrow the amount of P4000 to add to her capital for her existing dried fish business. The future income from this loan will be used for loan repayments, daily basic needs and savings for the future use of their child.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

It has 6 members, women who are neighbors and know each other. Clara Antonia R. R\u00edos will use her loan to buy pots, pans, and bulk peanuts to sell.  Esmeralda Maribel R\u00edos Guti\u00e9rrez is going to buy bulk peanuts and candy (peanut brittle and jamoncillo--candy made with milk, sugar and ground pumpkin seeds) to sell.  Rosalina Roberta L. C. is going to buy packages of wafers to recut them into different sizes and sell them by the box.  Imelda Mar\u00edn Vel\u00e1zquez is going to buy bulk peanuts, peanut brittle, alegr\u00eda (amaranth candy), tamarind, jamoncillo, and coconut cookies to sell.  Anadeli L. P\u00e9rez is going to buy bulk peanuts, bulk sweet potatoes, and corn to sell.  Maleni N. R\u00edos is going to buy catalogues and supply her first orders.  \r\n\r\nEsmeralda Maribel R\u00edos Guti\u00e9rrez is 38 years old and studied through the third year of secondary school, obtaining her certificate.  She is married and has three children: Jorge, 14 years old, who attends secondary school; Wilbert, 16 years old, studying for his bachillerato (a level between secondary school and college); and Maleni, 18 years old, who works making typical candy and peanuts.  Esmeralda is asking for the loan to buy brown sugar, honey, peanuts, amaranth, tamarind, and sugar.  She has a business selling candies.  The products she offers are alegr\u00eda, peanut brittle, jamoncillo, tamarind, chilacayote (squash), and sweet potatoes.  She has been doing this since she was little; her parents were in the business and taught her.  It has been her family heritage for generations.  In the beginning, her raw material suppliers gave her credit, and she paid later, but some of the other customers did not pay.  Now they don't give credit, and she has to pay cash for what she buys.\r\n\r\nShe goes to sell her candies at the fair in Amecameca in the market stalls. She goes to Cuautla, to Yecapixtla, and to Ozumba.  Her customers are all kinds of people: men, women, children, young women.  She buys a ticket or takes public transportation to get to the fairs or market stalls.  Her business is important because it's how she maintains herself and her family.  It's how she pays for her children's schooling, for food, and for transportation tickets, and it's how she pays back the loan.  Her favorite part of her business is when her sales are good and she is proud to be able to make the candies her parents make and taught her to make since she was a little girl.  The challenges her business faces are elevated prices and the climate.  When it's cold, it harms the alegr\u00eda, and when it's hot, the candy sweats a lot.  Her family participates in the business.  Her children package the candy and her husband helps her to make it.  Her business encounters competition from the other candy stands, but in the market stalls, everything is there, and people buy from who they want.  She will invest the earnings from the business in merchandise, in food to eat, and in paying back the loan.  Esmeralda is planning to expand her business into other candies, and she plans to do it by managing her profits well.  This business has helped the family a lot in affording food and all the children's school costs.  The improvements she would like to make to her house are fixing the roof and plastering it.  She is very happy with this opportunity she has been given and says thank you for having confidence in us.  She hopes her children will have a profession and live happy and well.  This loan will help her to invest in the candies in order to keep helping her children's education.  The members of the group want to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"thank you for having confidence in us and we hope you keep helping more people who need it\".\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":714071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of brown sugar, honey, peanuts, amaranth, tamarind, and sugar to make candy","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Amilcingo, Temoac, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-02-19T18:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clara Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esmeralda Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalina Roberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anadeli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maleni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.93},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.93},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.93},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.93},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":271.88,"local_amount":3250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3280.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850173},{"amount":679.68,"local_amount":8125,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:05Z","rounded_local_amount":8201.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292449},{"amount":543.75,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":6561.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160707},{"amount":679.69,"local_amount":8125,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:30Z","rounded_local_amount":8201.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233581}],"funded_date":"2011-02-20T02:01:49Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":278688,"name":"Kalyiman's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kalyiman K. is the treasurer of this group.

Ricardo has two children and also takes care of the children of his partner who had an accident and is in recovery.  It was his partner's sister who, seeing the need and also valuing the sacrifice that Ricardo was making, hired the kiosk which is located in quite a strategic location owing to the large number of people who purchase things from it as they pass by.  On days when his eldest son Leo doesn't have school, Ricardo also works as a builder so that he can further contribute towards his household finances.\r\n\r\nRicardo hopes for his sons to become fine, upstanding young men and so he insists in providing them with a good education and, so far as he can, provides them with everything they need.  His eldest son is 16 years old and his second is 12 years old.  The little ones are 6 and 4.  His eldest son also contributes towards the family as he looks after his young siblings while his father is working.  During the loan evaluation, I was able to meet Ricardo's partner, Patricia, who is recovering from a fall that she suffered.  She was receiving medical treatment for more than a year as she was found unconscious.  Now, however, her recovery process is completely favorable.  There are days when she also goes down to the kiosk to accompany Ricardo so that she can occupy herself and aid her own recovery.  She tries to help out with the small kiosk."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":914706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to have working capital for his business selling candies, cookies, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2011-11-12T13:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo Candelario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:43:27Z","rounded_local_amount":171.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250744729},{"amount":25,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-24T08:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":171.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257540263},{"amount":25,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-21T07:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":171.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264339833},{"amount":50,"local_amount":333.34,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":343.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276612597},{"amount":25,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T07:56:39Z","rounded_local_amount":171.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287308048},{"amount":25,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":171.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294307956},{"amount":30,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":205.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301363167},{"amount":45.01,"local_amount":300.01,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":308.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308753041},{"amount":25,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":171.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315358146},{"amount":24.99,"local_amount":166.63,"processed_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:58:01Z","rounded_local_amount":171.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322967904}],"funded_date":"2011-12-18T12:14:03Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:58:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":360684,"name":"Joena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"43-year-old Joena is a married woman with 5 children.

As a child she helped her parents with their agricultural work, and once she moved in with her husband they planted a few hectares of citrus trees, which earn them a good income. Two years ago she opened a small kiosk in front of her house to sell soft drinks and cookies. The booth made a profit; soft drinks were in high demand because of the heat, so she began to sell them with ice. She also grows coffee and citrus fruits, but only for the season when prices are high and she can make a profit. This is her fourth loan with Kiva partner Microfinanzas Prisma.

Her oldest son, Jimmy is just 19 years old and has settled down with his own family, but the rest of Gilda's children are still going to school. Jimmy helps his mother run their small restaurant in Isabela, Negros Occidental. Gilda hopes that all of her younger children will be able to finish their college education so that they could earn good incomes and provide for their own families.\r\n\r\nThe death of her husband left Gilda alone to raise her family, but she faced this trial with courage and conviction because her love and concern for her children transcended any difficulty that she experienced. She doubled her efforts knowing that she was the only one left who could provide for the family.\r\n\r\nEven with her recent loss, Gilda was not fazed by the trials that have come to her at that time. She knew that she could sustain her family if she held on and used her skills and knowledge in running a food business. This is not surprising because she's been doing it for quite a long time. She was already engaged in food vending long before she married her husband, and continued with it during her married life, becoming her husband's helpmate in supporting their large family. \r\n\r\nShe also trained her children while they were young and now they are also able to lend a hand in running the business when they had no school work. In 2006, Gilda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could expand her business. As she paid off each loan on time and performing well as a member, Gilda gained access to larger loans which she fully made use of by expanding her operations even further. It now earns her a monthly net income of PHP 7,500.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of Php 13,000 was used as additional capital for her business, and she was able to repay her loan on time without any delays. For her 7th cycle loan, she intends to borrow the same amount to be used as additional capital for her business and whatever income from it will be used for the education of her children and for her family needs.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":401837,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

O. is 21 years old and lives with his wife and one-year-old daughter in a house in the Tosontsengel Province of Central Mongolia. His wife works as a bank teller.\r\n\r\nO. operates a raw-material retail business in his town. He started his business in 2006 with the help of his older brother. After lots of hard work and determination, O. operates his business independently. He purchases skins and wool from herders and sells them for a profit in the Central Market. One day, O. hopes to have his own store where his customers and suppliers can come to him. He is requesting a 2,000,000 tugrug (approx. $1381 USD) loan to purchase livestock skins that he will sell in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city, and to buy a car for his family.\t\r\n\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009. It is the largest microfinance organization in Mongolia, but also has mainstream commercial operations. XacBank has the vision, scale and innovation to develop and implement new solutions to poverty. It is currently utilizing Kiva\u2019s 0% lending interest rate to return 9% of interest paid from borrowers to them in the form of a savings account at the end of their loans. This not only allows borrowers to gain financially, but also encourages them to save.\r\n\r\nTo get regular updates from XacBank, please join <A

","en":"\r\nWalter, 21, is an enterprising young man, who lives in his own home with his parents:  Mauro, 45 and Re\u00edda, 47.  \r\n\r\nHe has, as examples, his parents, who are hard-working, honorable people, who daily teach him farming techniques for efficient labor.  \r\n\r\nFor the past 6 years, Walter has farmed peas, broad beans, potatoes and corn with his parents.  What he likes best about his work is plowing the fields because, as he says, he always feels that he's planting hope or a new life that will bear abundant fruit because he works his fields with much love.  On the other hand, these last few months he has had to struggle against the inclement weather which, if he's not attentive and careful, can wreak havoc with his crops.\r\n\r\nHe isn't frightened by these adversities, however. He is confident that the next harvest will increase his earnings because, in farming, there are no losses, especially if you provide the proper care to your plantings.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
