She is thankful to Kiva and to all the lenders who helped her get this financing.  She currently owns one cow, three young bulls and 10 pigs.  She sells organic milk on a daily basis.  She makes a monthly income of 30,000 som (KGS).  In order to further grow her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 100,000 (KGS) which will help her to buy two dairy cows as well as feed for her livestock.  Natalya realized that producing and selling organic milk can be a profitable business and, for this reason, she wants to increase this particular area of her activity.  She is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further increase her number of farm animals.

Having more responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a sari-sari store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 800 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Bonifacia would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 25,000 PHP, she could already purchase larger quantities and a greater variety of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Bonifacia hopes to maintain an increasing profit from her business. She dreams for her family to be always happy and healthy. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

She is 51 years old and is happily married to Regalado. God has blessed them with three children and all of them are still studying. Life indeed is hard, but by the grace of God, they have been able to raise their children well and they are helping each other in working for their family.\r\n\r\nEdna owns a variety store. This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in a community, and it is either just connected to their house or just inside it. This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, one egg, and other things. She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price and then sells them per piece for a higher price to make a profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors, passersby, and the people in the community. She earns PHP 1,000 a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting PHP 50,000 to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages. This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nEdna desires to always meet the needs of her family, and she hopes that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1804046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

All of them are of the Miskito ethnic group and live in Bilwi, a town in the municipality of Puerto Cabezas.  They are enterprising women who strive each day to generate income from their small businesses.  Tatiana is the owner of a grocery store, Loira sells seafood, and Daysi sells provisions at the municipal market.  With the small amount of profit they earned as a result of their previous loan, they were able to make progress with their goals.  For example, Loira was able to repair part of her house.  They are requesting their second loan so that they can continue improving their businesses.  <br \/><br \/>Daysi is a member of this solidarity group.  She is a friendly woman who is originally from Waspam Rio Coco.  Daysi moved to Bilwi in 1982 during a time when the entire town of Rio Coco had to evacuate.  She is 35 years old, married, and has five children.  Three of them are attending school since they are at the appropriate age.  Her husband is a bricklayer, but he does not have a permanent job.

Liberal Arts and Sciences. Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe university tuition fee is like a making an investment for one\u2019s future. As my father says, the more you invest, the more you get in your life. And I believe in it. I entered American University of Central Asia, because AUCA provides an excellent educational background. The course of FYS (First Year Seminar) is very important, since here we start to construct our first academic speeches in English. It is very important for further self-development.\r\n\r\nMy family consists of six people: my father, my mother, my grandmother, me and my two younger brothers. My grandmother is 83 years old and a pensioner. My mother is on maternity leave and preparing to give birth to my sister. Despite the fact that we are short of money, we are happy to have one more member of our friendly and happy family. My younger brother has health problems and visits a doctor often, and gets special treatment. My youngest brother is in kindergarten, but this year he is to go to school. We live in an unfinished house, which has been under construction for almost for six years and is not finished yet. Unfortunately, our current financial situation will not allow us to finish it soon.\r\n\r\nThe Kiva loan is a new project in Kyrgyzstan, something unfamiliar for most of our citizens. So I am happy to have a chance to receive one as a student of AUCA. One more time it shows that AUCA has the best partners and it provides modern life conveniences. I really believe that Kiva changes one\u2019s life and I hope that one day I will become a Kiva lender myself.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1804097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Solomon is a youthful farmer from the Kitale area of Kenya.

is a freshman at the American University of Central Asia, Department of International and Business Law. Here is his story:\r\n\r\n\u201cEducation means a lot for me and my family. My parents have taught me the importance of education from my childhood, and it had a great influence on me as I was a diligent and smart student at school. Studying at American University of Central Asia provides a great opportunity to study at an international university with a diverse atmosphere, and to fulfill my professional and personal goals, which are to make a big contribution to the community.\r\n\r\nI have a happy family with warm feelings toward each other, and there are six of us: my parents, me, my two younger brothers and a little sister. My father is a driver and my mother is a laboratory worker at one of the local hospitals in my town. She gets around 133 USD per month, which isn\u2019t enough for anything, but to pay for my brothers\u2019 school and my sister\u2019s kindergarten. As we live in Tokmok town, I take a bus to come to the university in Bishkek, which takes about an hour. It\u2019s so uncomfortable to wake up so early in order to be at the first class at 8:00 am and use crowded public transportation; usually I have to stand, as there isn\u2019t place for students.\r\n\r\nAUCA serves as a bridge between my student life and my future career. For me, intention to succeed is more important than anything else. I am a hardworking and determined person, and I\u2019m ready for a new jump of getting a degree at AUCA.I believe in my abilities and leadership skills, which I think will be a great asset to anything and a great motivation for other students. I thank Kiva lenders for their trust in me and for their generosity.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1804122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She is employed in a garment factory, also in Cavite through the auspices of the Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative (CCT). Elsa works as a seamstress, sewing clothing according to the company or client\u2019s dictates. She uses a sewing machine and other stitching machines as well as hand stitching hems and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Elsa is meeting family expenses without access to savings or credit. Workers can become heavily indebted to money lenders who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason Elsa is asking for your assistance to help her circumvent loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem in repaying them since the loan payments were automatically deducted from her paycheck. She is seeking a 15,000 PHP loan to pay for her children\u2019s educational expenses.\r\n\r\nElsa hopes to give her children a good education. She looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. \r\n\r\nCCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force and equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\nCCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers such as Levita before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and after-work hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1804147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for the educational expenses of her children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-01-28T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-27T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3860.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200644},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3860.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186924},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3860.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535952},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:53:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3860.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017168}],"funded_date":"2015-01-28T18:37:29Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:53:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":833340,"name":"Merlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlita is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a fishing business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 25,000 through NWTF to purchase additional fishing nets, gasoline, etc. for her fishing business.\r\n\r\nMerlita has been in this business for 10 years.

Tucked away in the countryside near the Kapkatet, Litein area of Kenya is a jobless man who is now a farmer named Paul. He lives with his lovely family. He is a hardworking and truthful man; he is honest and faithful to what he does and what he says. \r\n\r\n\u201cKapkatet\u201d in the local dialect means \u201cvalley.\u201d In this valley are a people who, in their totality, constitute wrenching statistics. Hardcore poverty pervades every homestead. Yet, every day when you look beyond the numbers, you will see a sea of people: a sea of about 1,000 bright, vibrant, open faces, searching and yearning for the opportunity to live a life of dignity and respect. They have the conviction that it\u2019s possible. They are like the bones in the \u201cvalley of dry bones\u201d that required only a breath to spring back to life. \r\n\r\nArmed with this conviction, Paul has kept hope and has been toiling on his farm for the past 12 years. His primary sources of income have been milk, poultry and some \u201cside hustles\u201d he does to supplement the meager income he earns from farming. The Kapkatet area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a sea of people, but the mill keeps breaking down, preventing farmers from grinding their maize. Paul intends to change this and is requesting a loan to buy an electric posho mill, which will grind corn or maize into flour. \r\n\r\nMaize meal is very common in Kenya and is a staple food for many communities. Many Kenyan families consume the maize product \u201cugali\u201c (hard porridge) regularly. The market usually provides sifted flour, but the cost is higher because of the sifting and packaging. Cheaper flour can be obtained by milling the maize directly using a posho mill. \r\n\r\nThrough this loan, Paul will be able to grind maize faster because he will use an electric posho mill. Cases of breakdown will be rare because electric posho mills are more reliable. This loan will assist Paul to permanently change his life and achieve his life mission of driving economic development and poverty alleviation in communities in arid and semi-arid areas. Profits from the posho mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan, which Paul promises to fully repay on time. In the next two years, Paul sees himself as a very established businessman who will be running more than one posho mill in his remote village. Paul patiently waits for your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550.86,"image":{"id":1804153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy an electric posho mill","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-28T17:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-27T17:10:13Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.22,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4300.81},{"due_date":"2015-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4426.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4555.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4689.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4826.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4967.09},{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":5112.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":5261.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":5415.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":5573.7},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":5736.59},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":5904.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":6076.79},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":6254.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":6437.17},{"due_date":"2016-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":6625.34},{"due_date":"2016-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":6818.92},{"due_date":"2016-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":7018.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.57},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.31},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.95},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.8},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.81},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.01},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.41,"local_amount":6128.42,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6195.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262822},{"amount":49.02,"local_amount":4456.6,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4505.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265035},{"amount":43.81,"local_amount":3983.07,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4026.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601214},{"amount":51.93,"local_amount":4720.52,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4771.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459661},{"amount":55.57,"local_amount":5077.09,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:23Z","rounded_local_amount":5132.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"payment_id":681378089},{"amount":53.44,"local_amount":4915.91,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4969.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.64,"payment_id":696587755},{"amount":219.46,"local_amount":20795.93,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:30Z","rounded_local_amount":21022.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.3,"payment_id":711506063}],"funded_date":"2015-02-25T23:14:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":833345,"name":"Mydee","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mydee is 30 years old.

village of Kwanza, Kitale. He has been practicing agricultural business for the past nine years and has never looked back. For a living, Daniel sells milk and food products from his farm at the local market. He enjoys seeing clients coming back for more of his products and he really feels satisfied. \r\n\r\nAlthough Daniel has been making profits through farming, he has always wanted to do poultry farming. The main challenge he has encountered is a lack of funds to get his business off the ground. Daniel is seeking a loan to buy quality breeds of poultry. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Kitale. It is also a business that can be done on a part-time basis to earn extra income. Daniel does not worry too much about competition because the market for poultry products is good - chicken is a popular meal for many people and this can be seen if you visit any fast food joint. With this loan, Daniel is confident that his income will increase and this will allow a permanent change in his life. He plans to buy different breeds of broilers and layers and will be selling eggs and meat to the local market and other major markets in Kenya. He also plans to start breeding, which will help increase the number of poultry on his farm. \r\n\r\nOther than profits from selling eggs, poultry feathers, and poultry meat, Daniel will also benefit from using the poultry manure, which is an excellent source of nutrients for his farm.

Meet Stephen: young, honest, humble and a very hardworking person. He hails from the Kitale area of Kenya, an area that is very fertile and has one of the best weather patterns on earth that favors farming. Stephen is still young and has so much that he wants to achieve before hitting 40; that is why he is focused and dreaming of being successful. \r\n\r\nStephen never got the chance to go to college because of a lack of money for fees, but this never killed the zeal that he had for succeeding, and he started farming five years ago on a small plot of farmland that he inherited from his parents. Through hard work he has managed to practice crop farming and animal farming, and has managed to take care of his parents and also take care of his basic needs. Stephen grows vegetables and fruits and keeps dairy cows as a source of income. \r\n\r\nAlthough Stephen has been making profits, he is challenged by timely delivery of products to the market. This has made his profits go down, because goods reach the market when they are not fresh and hence fetch lower prices. Stephen comes from an area that has poor feeder roads and this has been a major problem for him. That is why he is seeking a loan of 60,000 KES to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike, Stephen will be able to transport his farm produce to the market and deliver it in a timely manner, and hence it will fetch higher prices. Vegetables, fruits and milk are perishable products and they require quick delivery to the market, so this motorbike will be of so much help. Through timely delivery of his product, Stephen is sure of increased profits and this will translate to better living conditions and a secure future. \r\n\r\nStephen is very ambitious and he is planning that once he has accumulated more profits, he will be able to go back to school.

You can start from any level and there are so many forms of farming you can do,\" says Joel. Joel, aged 41 years, is a resident of Koibatek, a remote village in Kapsowar, Kenya. He owns a small plot of inherited land on which he has been practicing mixed farming for more than 15 years. He grows a variety of crops and keeps dairy cows and poultry. \n\nThe income he makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet his family's expenses. He needs to improve his income level, and that is why he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Joel passionately loves dairy farming and as he likes to put it, \u201cDairy farming is close to my heart.\" He plans not to buy just an ordinary cow but to buy a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 10-20 liters of milk a day. The additional milk will result in additional income and hence improved living conditions. \n\nThe income generated from selling the milk will be used to fully repay the loan and also towards the education of his children.

The farmers\u2019 crops are also bought by ECA every week - they come to their farms so the participants do not need to walk long distances to find a market for their crops.

She and her husband have a child who is already in college. She has been employed in a garment factory in Cavite for three years through the help of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nRosebel works as a seamstress. She does the sewing and designing of clothing\/apparel according to the company's or client\u2019s demand. She sews clothes using a sewing machine or other stitching machines, or often does hand stitching of edges and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Rosebel, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses. They have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Rosebel is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative, and she had no problem in repaying them since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day. She looks forward to your positive response, and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will also use the loan to pay for her family's personal needs and other expenses.\r\n\r\nRosebel hopes to give her family a good life. She attends fellowship meetings** to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before they start their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring, and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1804191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for personal needs and other expenses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-01-28T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-27T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosebel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2206.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200645},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2206.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186925},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2206.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535953},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:53:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2206.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017169}],"funded_date":"2015-01-28T23:12:47Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:53:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":833379,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is married and works hard to support her family.

She is thankful to Kiva and to all those who help her finance her loan. Zamira currently has 2 cows and 5 sheep on her farm. She also owns a 1.0 hectare plot of land and rents a 2.0 hectare plot of land on which she grows onions, corns and clover for sale. Zamira's average monthly income is 20,000 som (KGS).

She has been running a shop selling clothes and shoes for seven years now; she buys at wholesale from big suppliers and resells at retail. In order to help her business grow and make more income, she decided to find financial support from Tujijenge Tanzania, Kiva's partner.\r\n\r\nShe now has a cereal business where she purchases up to 30 tonnes of grains, beans or sunflower seeds and resells to small sellers. This type of business depends on which season cereals are available. She is really a hardworking woman. Her dream is to manage up to 90 tonnes of cereals per week. She is in her mid thirties and is married. \r\n\r\nSecilia works from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. every working day and is able to make a very good monthly profit. This is her third credit cycle from Tujijenge. She has paid back all of her previous loans successfully. She used her previous loans to start the cereal business.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Secilia was sharing a lorry (cargo van) with another seller to transport her cereals from the purchasing area to the market. This was due to the small capital she had at the time. Her second loan assisted her a lot, and she was able to rent her own cargo van. Bad luck: The van which was transporting her stock of cereals got into an accident, so she lost part of her stock and now needs to recover.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan that she will use to replenish her stock of cereals so that her business can grow. Secilia will share this loan with her group, Kampala, consisting of two women who will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":1804187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cereals for her business to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":87,"posted_date":"2015-01-28T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-27T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":146.1,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Secilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":505179.72},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":535490.52},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":567619.94},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":601677.14},{"due_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":637777.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":676044.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":716607.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":759603.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":294.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":371.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":394.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":417.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":138.92,"local_amount":252589.86,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":253050.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624408460},{"amount":236.76,"local_amount":430472.62,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T12:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":431258.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636756764},{"amount":452.36,"local_amount":827619.94,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:57:42Z","rounded_local_amount":829130.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.83,"payment_id":649747474},{"amount":305.95,"local_amount":609087.28,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:40:36Z","rounded_local_amount":610198.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":29.05,"payment_id":665237252},{"amount":325.41,"local_amount":645187.9,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":646365.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":29.44,"payment_id":681543666},{"amount":395.39,"local_amount":758831.92,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":760216.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.98,"payment_id":696749026},{"amount":749.11,"local_amount":1476210.48,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1478904.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":62.8,"payment_id":711680942}],"funded_date":"2015-02-23T17:11:41Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T19:03:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":832572,"name":"Gregoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Gregoria se sigue dedicando al negocio de venta de jugos, la socia es una mujer emprendedora y trabajadora,la socia por medio de este negocio quiere abrir una cafeteria.

He also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income he earns through farming. Joseph passionately loves dairy farming. The biggest challenge he faces is feeding his cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. He is seeking a loan to buy another quality breed of dairy cow. He intends to buy not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be produce between 15 and 25 liters of milk a day. The selling price for milk is 40 KES per liter, and with this loan, he would make (USD) $11 per day. Before Joseph joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports smallholder farmers with technical and financial solutions, he considered dairy farming to be a mediocre fallback occupation that did not have any future promise for income generation. After training, Joseph now believes that dairy farming is the business to go into if you want to succeed. With the loan, Joseph will increase his income from milk selling and his cows will have more food to eat and never reject food. The key to high yield in milk production is proper feeding of the cows, and through this loan, Joseph will achieve this. An increase in income will allow Joseph to improve his living conditions and secure the future of his children. His dream is to continue improving his dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards. Joseph hopes his dreams would be realized if Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders provide him with credit support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1804221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-28T21:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-27T21:00:15Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.51,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2795.73},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2916.41},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3001.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3089.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3179.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3272.57},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3368.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3466.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3567.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3672.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3779.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3890.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.82},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.89},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.14},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.44,"local_amount":5550.1,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5738.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265037},{"amount":34.42,"local_amount":3059.65,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3163.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601218},{"amount":41.09,"local_amount":3652.04,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3775.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459663},{"amount":27.65,"local_amount":2486.79,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2571.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.33,"payment_id":696587757},{"amount":77.58,"local_amount":7188.23,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:31Z","rounded_local_amount":7431.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.29,"payment_id":711506067},{"amount":200.31,"local_amount":18063.19,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":18675.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.89,"payment_id":752111064}],"funded_date":"2015-02-25T20:04:22Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":833402,"name":"Meriam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meriam is a hard-working entrepreneur who has a bamboo waiving business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 18,000 through NWTF to purchase more bamboo to weave for her business.\r\n\r\nMeriam has been in this business for three years.

He hails from Litein in Kenya, a tea-growing area where the staple food is \u201cMursik,\u201d a mouth-watering delicacy prepared from milk. Joseph has been involved in farming for the past 5 years and he owns dairy cows that produce milk for sale. Besides his dairy cows, he also keeps poultry and when you visit his farm you will witness tea growing as well as a variety of vegetables. <br \/><br \/>Joseph has a passion for dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of his cows, but all is not well for this humble man. He is facing the challenge of the lack of a proper dairy unit which is why he is seeking funds to construct a proper dairy unit. With your loan, he will be able to better manage his dairy farm and create more value. A better dairy unit will assist Joseph to save more money because his cows will never be sick and this will also boost his dairy's milk production. Through building a dairy unit with the loan, Joseph will be able to collect the cows' by-products, namely, cow dung and urine which can be sold or better yet used on his farm. With a dairy unit, he will be able to better feed his animals and collect by-products such as dung to generate biogas fuel, make organic fertilizer and plaster his mud hut. <br \/><br \/>The money that he will earn from the dairy unit will be reinvested back into the business to create growth. Joseph is a very ambitious man and he projects that through the loan he will have higher quality dairy cows and be able to permanently change his living conditions and secure his children's future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":259.65,"image":{"id":1804256,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To construct a proper dairy unit for his cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-28T22:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-27T22:20:04Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.75,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.61,"local_amount":8237.57,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":8327.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459665},{"amount":82.36,"local_amount":7576.27,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":7658.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.98,"payment_id":696587759},{"amount":83.93,"local_amount":7791.1,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":7876.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.77,"payment_id":731022882}],"funded_date":"2015-02-23T03:14:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Benjamin","image":1467297}},{"id":833421,"name":"Bahar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bahar  is a 37-year-old married mother of two kids  who has worked as a hairdresser from her house for seven years to help her husband in covering the needs and expenses of their family.

However, he has always had the strength to overcome hardship and move forward with his two lovely children. He is a small farmer based in Kitale, which is an agricultural center near famous Mount Elgon (17th highest in Arica). He owns a small piece of land together with his lovely wife, and for ten years they have raised dairy cattle and grown vegetables. They recently opened a small milling business to supplement the meager income they earn from farming. From Kiva lenders, Jamin is seeking a loan for KES 65,000 to grow his horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, which is evident from steadily rising exports. It is against this backdrop that Jamin wants to turn his farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. This loan will not only increase his income, but also reduce his family's income vulnerability."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":630.1,"image":{"id":1804314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to expand his horticulture business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-28T23:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-27T23:00:06Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.51,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jamin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.54,"local_amount":10089.95,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":10310.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262827},{"amount":69.39,"local_amount":6221.5,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6357.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601221},{"amount":47.26,"local_amount":4236.74,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4329.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459667},{"amount":69.63,"local_amount":6294.17,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6431.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.57,"payment_id":681378095},{"amount":34.5,"local_amount":3139.79,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3208.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.52,"payment_id":696587761},{"amount":120.45,"local_amount":11291.22,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:32Z","rounded_local_amount":11538.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.49,"payment_id":711506070},{"amount":166.82,"local_amount":15218.79,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":15551.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.93,"payment_id":752111067}],"funded_date":"2015-02-25T22:25:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":833427,"name":"Mwanamisi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanamisi is married woman and has five children all of whom attend school.

He has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem in repaying them since the loan payments were automatically deducted from his paycheck. He is seeking a 10,000 PHP loan to pay for his children\u2019s educational expenses.\r\n\r\nLeomar wants for his children to complete their schooling and have a better future. He looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. \r\n\r\nCCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force and equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\nCCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers such as Levita before starting their daily work routine.

She has a secondary education. For the past several years, she has been practicing livestock breeding and crop farming. Thanks to Kanzada's hard work, she currently has 2 cows and 40 chickens on her farm. She also has a 0.54 hectare plot of land on which she grows corn for sale. Kanzada's average monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). However, this amount is not enough for a decent quality of life for Kanzada and her family. She really would like the opportunity to help her children and her grandchildren. For the further development of her business, Kanzada turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan for 50,000 som (KGS) to buy cattle to fatten up and resell. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further development of her business so that she can have the chance to start building a

Pinneo","image":603028}},{"id":833474,"name":"Evans","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evans is a humble farmer who goes to work on his farm every morning. He is dedicated to his work. This man only thinks about going forward and delivering good products. Evans knows that many people consume his products, and because of this, every drop of sweat that comes from his forehead is the determination that he puts in so that his products are pure and of good quality. He is a progressive, smallholder, mixed-farmer in Kenya. He comes from the luxuriant, white highlands of Litein, an area known for tea production and dairy farming. \r\n\r\nEvans owns a fertile, two-acre piece of land in this lush region of Kenya. He keeps dairy cattle, and grows tea and maize. He gets a lot of support from his dear wife, Emmy. Being a father comes with lots of responsibility, and feeding his large family requires a lot of hard work, so Evans has to put in extra effort to take care of his family. Evans started farming just after finishing high school. Since he never advanced his education, and because of the high unemployment rate, he ventured into farming, and he has never regretted it because of the profits he has been making. \r\n\r\nEvans practices mixed farming, and is regarded as one of the most hardworking farmers in his village, because he is able to juggle raising dairy cows and also doing crop farming. Evans is a visionary and enterprising person, and has always wanted to do dairy farming in large scale. One of the challenges he has faced is lack of sufficient capital. That is why he is seeking a loan to buy a dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya has seen an upsurge in growth, and milk prices in the recent past have skyrocketed. This has translated to increased earnings for farmers. Evans has already decided which dairy breed he requires and, because of his immense knowledge about preparing hay, his cows will have plenty of food and will produce more milk. Evans projects that the cow he acquires with this loan will be producing more than 10 liters a day. Because there is a ready market for milk, he does not worry too much about competition, and marketing the milk will not be a challenge. Evans will be selling it directly to the market, as well as to big dairy-processing firms, which will result in increased earnings. Additionally, Evans has planned that instead of selling the milk in its raw form, he will package the milk. This will also improve his income. Profits from selling milk will enable Evans to be very successful. He also plans that with his accumulated profits, he will be able to construct a biogas digester soon, to produce energy that he will use in cooking and other domestic chores. Through the loan Evans is confident that his life will be transformed and his dream of providing a secure future for his family and siblings will be achieved. Evans is relieved to know that his life can be secured through partners such as Kiva lenders who help small scale and aspiring men such as him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":353.32,"image":{"id":1804369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-29T00:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-28T00:40:04Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.49,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3368.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3544.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3648.15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3754.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3864.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3977.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4093.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4213.31},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4336.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4463.18},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4593.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4727.86},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4866.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5008.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5154.61},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5305.26},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5460.3},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5619.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.9},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.82},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.71},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.22},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.78},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.38},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.03},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.72},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.86,"local_amount":8947.32,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":8965.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265039},{"amount":74.54,"local_amount":6815.45,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6829.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459668},{"amount":89.68,"local_amount":8323.56,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":8340.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.36,"payment_id":696587762},{"amount":87.75,"local_amount":8217.46,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":8234.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.13,"payment_id":731022884}],"funded_date":"2015-02-26T00:45:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sue Tritt","image":null}},{"id":833478,"name":"Jetina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jetina is 65 years old and has 9 children.

mother of three daughters.  She is a college graduate.  She works as a chief accountant at a State Natural Reserve, a job which provides her family with its main source of income.  Nurbubu has also been involved in agriculture for the past ten years already: she currently owns one cow and 13 sheep.  Thanks to her very hard work, she now makes 7,000 som (KGS) per month from her farming activity, while her income from her job is about 12,000 som (KGS).

Meet Caleb a young farmer from Kiminini, a remote village in Kitale Kenya, who has defied the common thinking about most Kenyans that agriculture is for the older generation. \r\n\r\nCaleb is happily married and together with his wife they are blessed with 3 boys and 1 girl. His primary source of income is milk and also he plants tomatoes on his farm. He has named his tomato farm \u201cever blazing farm\u201d. He also engages in personal business and has been able to earn a handsome profit from the venture. Caleb practices agriculture with a difference, employing youthful energy, enthusiasm and knowledge from the agricultural training he has been attending to broaden his skills. Although he earns handsome profits from farming, he faces one big challenge and that is high prices in fertilizers, seedlings and inputs. This is a result of the monopoly that is enjoyed by the only agro vet shop in his area.\r\n\r\nCaleb is requesting a loan to start an agro vet shop. The Kiminini area has only one agro dealer who is catering to thousands of smallholder farmers who solely depend on him for agricultural inputs. The agro dealer has been making a killing from farmers by charging them extra amounts since he is the only agro dealer and enjoys a monopoly. Caleb wants to change this and seize the business opportunity and through your loan he will start an agro vet shop and tap into the potential agricultural market. Caleb will also help the smallholder farmers in his area who for a long time have been having a serious problem accessing affordable farm inputs. Through your loan, Caleb will change from the peasant farmer he is right now to a certified agro dealer who will be depended on by nearly 5,000 smallholder farmers in his area for inputs, knowledge and information about improved inputs. Through increased income from the loan he will improve his living conditions and his future plans are to purchase a truck which will be used to engage farmers in output marketing activities. Caleb believes that there is no doubt that youths like him can find rewarding employment in farming. He patiently waits for your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":514.12,"image":{"id":1804404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Pamela\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 8.75 acres of land and purchase a total of 5 solar lights."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1749002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-01-29T01:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-28T01:10:05Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agatha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jerredine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Feminus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":113160,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113160}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-22T23:17:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":832637,"name":"Vitalina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Vitalina, de 47 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio sexto grado, esta acompa\u00f1ada y es madre de 5 hijos, los cuales ya est\u00e1n casados, en su casa solo viven ellos con uno de sus hijos y una nieta que estudia sexto grado en la escuela de su comunidad.\n\nVitalina, se dedica al negocio de engordar pollos y venderlos, tambi\u00e9n tiene una peque\u00f1a tienda, mientras su esposo  trabaja en una cooperativa, ella cuida de su negocio y del ganado que tienen.\n\nEl cr\u00e9dito lo necesita para comprar concentrado para los pollos de engorde y para invertir en su tienda.\n\nEl sue\u00f1o de Vitalina es, que su peque\u00f1a crianza de pollos crezca, para obtener m\u00e1s ganancias y tener una mejor calidad de vida junto a su familia.","en":"Vitalina is 47 years of age and studied through the sixth grade.

This is the sad story of Moses, a youthful 58-year-old Mzee (old man): a wise farmer whose neighbors and fellow farmers respect him as a mentor.\r\n\r\nHe farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills near Kitale, in the northern Rift Valley region of Kenya. Moses' farming experience dates back to 2000. Like many other farmers in the region, maize is a staple crop which he has been planting for as long as he can remember. With time, the fertility of his land has started to dwindle and whenever he plants maize the yields go down with each crop season.\r\n\r\nMoses has also been affected with weeds: he recalls that, at some point, a strange but nice-looking weed which produced purple flowers emerged and started to slowly colonize his farm, causing his maize yields to decline even further. At one point he could not be assured that he would harvest anything at all. Moses' initial thought was that his farms had been bewitched, a notion that made him feel helpless.\r\n\r\nToday, Moses is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy fertilizers, pesticides and good quality seeds. Through this loan, Moses is going to increase his crop production and this will translate to improved income level.\r\n\r\nThis loan will permanently change Moses' living standards and there is no doubt that he can find rewarding employment in farming.\r\n\r\nLenders: kindly lend to this hero who strives to provide a better future for both his family and
