Antony also decided to purchase a solar light as part of his loan, which he is very excited about, as it will allow him to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.<br \/><br \/>Obtaining this loan means that Antony's Group will be able to receive a total of seven solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 7.5 acres."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1748656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-01-29T02:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-28T02:10:13Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maurice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moffat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary A.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andoni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann S","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adrian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sylvanus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maurice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":106440,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106440}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-26T00:14:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":832653,"name":"Lorena Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lorena es madre soltera, ella  cruza los 24 a\u00f1os de edad y su hijo tiene 3 a\u00f1os, Lorena tiene su negocio que es la realizaci\u00f3n de postres desde hace 2 a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s, Lorena vive con su madre y su hijo, Lorena necesita el cr\u00e9dito parar comprar frutas, az\u00facar leche y dem\u00e1s productos que utiliza para realizar sus postres, comenta que los vende a veces entregando a otras j\u00f3venes que ellas los revenden y  otras  veces ofreciendo a quien desee comprar, Lorena aspira mejorar su negocio seguir adelante y tener ingresos para darle a su hijo le indispensable.","en":"Lorena is a single mother.

She is 51 years old and has children who are already working. Life indeed is hard. But by the grace of God, she was able to raise her children well and they are helping each other in working for their family.\r\n\r\nCelia owns a variety store. This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community and the store is just connected to or just inside their houses. This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, a PHP-5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg and others. She gets her product from a wholesaler at a lower price, and then she will sell it per piece for a higher price to have profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors, passersby and the people in the community. She earns PHP 500 a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nCelia desires that her business will continue to grow and she is hoping to have more customers.

He is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in his village because of his resilience despite personal challenges and his passion to support his four children as a primary caregiver. The living conditions in the Kitale area are very tough and you need to have tough skin in order to survive. Joseph has always shown the resilience to beat all the odds. <br \/><br \/>Because of the hardcore poverty in his village, Joseph started practicing mixed farming and has been doing it for the past 10 years. Joseph's sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg selling; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, and one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. The Kitale area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Joseph is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. <br \/><br \/>Joseph is very determined to succeed and because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans that through accumulated profits he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and also for his grandchildren. Joseph's dream is to provide a secure future for his grandchildren through paying tuition fees for them.

Depok is a city located at the south border of Jakarta, the capital city.  Sucipto runs and manages a small stall that sells snacks, drinks, and daily consumer products. He also sells mobile phone airtime credits and a utility bill payment service for his customers. Sucipto is married, and he and his wife have been blessed with one child. His wife is a full time housewife, and sometimes she helps Sucipto managing the stall. \r\n\r\nSucipto joined Ruma about four months ago. He was excited to join because he sees many opportunities to improve his business by becoming a Ruma agent. By becoming a Ruma agent, he has been able to expand his network and learn new mobile technology. He also learned about a new product from Ruma, which is e-commerce for low income communities. Basically, his customers can buy stuff in the Ruma catalog by ordering through Sucipto, who will text a format order to Ruma. It\u2019s another product from Ruma that Sucipto believes will give impact to customers who usually find it hard to get access to good-quality products with good prices. \r\n\r\nAs the business runs, Sucipto is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to process more mobile airtime credits and utility bill payment transactions, especially on the weekends. In the photo, Sucipto is standing in front of his small stall. He thanks you for your support.

Damaris sells new clothes from a rented stall at the municipal market.  Jhondra sells beauty products as a traveling saleswoman.  The three of them are determined to grow their businesses so that they and their families can have a better quality of life.

She is a friendly woman who has leadership qualities.  Karla is married and has two children.  Her older child is eight years old and is in the fourth grade of primary school.  The younger child is two years old.  Three years ago, she established a small grocery store where she generates her own income.  This enables her to contribute toward the household expenses and her child\u2019s education.  Karla Vanesa is requesting a loan in order to buy more products for her store such as basic grains, yogurts, instant soups, toilet paper, eggs, bread, and other products so that she can increase her earnings.  She dreams of experiencing more growth and having sufficient capital to expand and diversify the inventory of products in her business.  \r\n\r\nWith the first loan issued by Pana Pana and financed through Kiva, Jhondra was able to increase her inventory of beauty products.

Meet Lestari, a Ruma agent who lives in Depok. Depok is a city located at the south of Jakarta, the capital city. Lestari is happily married, and she and her husband have been blessed with three sons.  Her husband works as a private driver. \r\n\r\nTo support family\u2019s needs, Lestari and her husband decided to open a small stall which sells mobile phone sim cards, mobile phone airtime credits and utility bill payment service. Lestari manages it day-to-day while her husband works as a driver. \r\n\r\nLestari joined Ruma about four months ago, as a result of a visit to her stall from a Ruma agent. She was interested to join Ruma because she wanted to expand her network and learn how to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAs the business runs, Lestari is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to process more mobile airtime credits and utility bill payments transactions, especially on the weekends. \r\n\r\nIn the photo, Lestari is standing in front of her stall, which is where her customers usually come to buy mobile airtime or pay their bills. She thanks you for your

Depok is a city located at the south border of Jakarta, the capital city. \r\nAbdi runs and manages a small stall that sells snacks, drinks, and daily consumer products. He also sells mobile phone airtime credits and utility bill payment services for his customers.  Abdi is married, and he and his wife have been blessed with one son and one daughter. His wife is a full time housewife, and sometimes she helps Abdi to manage the stall. \r\n\r\nAbdi has been a member of Ruma for more than a year. He was excited to join because he sees many opportunities to improve his business by becoming a Ruma agent. By becoming a Ruma agent, he has been able to expand his network and learn new mobile technology. He also learned about a new product from Ruma, which is an e-commerce product for low-income communities. Basically, his customers can buy stuff in the Ruma catalog by ordering from Abdi, and Abdi will text a format order to Ruma. It\u2019s another product from Ruma that Abdi believes will help customers who usually find it hard to get access to good-quality products with good prices. \r\n\r\nAs the business runs, Abdi is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to process more mobile airtime credits and utility bill payments transactions, especially on the weekends. In the photo, Abdi is standing in front of his small stall.

Meet Ana, a Ruma agent who has beenwith Ruma for more than a year. This is the second time that Ana is applying for a Kiva loan. The first Kiva loan had helped her business to improve so much more that Ana is now able to add one more service in her stall.\r\n\r\nAna and her husband live in West Bogor, a suburban area located about 1.5 hours drive from Jakarta, the capital city. Her husband works as a staff in a local company. As a young married couple, Ana and her husband want to be prepared for their family. One day they will have children, and they need to improve their business to save more extra income. \r\n\r\nAna and her husband are very determined people; they work hard and they have been persistent in what they do. Ana has a small stall that sells groceries, daily consumer goods, also snacks and drinks. She also sells mobile phone airtime credits and utility bill payments service for her customers. \r\n\r\nFor the last 4 months, Ana has been selling new product from Ruma, which is e-commerce for the low income community, called \u2018Mapan\u2019. With Mapan, Ana is able to connect people in her community to many good quality products with better prices. \r\n\r\nAs the business runs, Ana is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to process more mobile airtime credits and utility bill payments transactions, especially on the weekends. \r\n\r\nIn the photo, Ana and her husband are standing in front of her small stall.

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I was a one-year-old child, my father passed away. My mother brought me up alone. She was a teacher at a local institute, with a salary of USD 153 per month. Of course, it wasn\u2019t enough money for our daily expenses, so she used to over-work and take extra classes. In such a way, she could earn about USD 529 per month. \r\n\r\n\"In 2013, she was diagnosed with a terrible disease and had chemotherapy twice. She left her job since she wasn\u2019t physically able to continue working. Due to her special treatment, I couldn\u2019t help her alone and we moved to my grandparents\u2019 house. Thanks to our relatives, I could continue my studies and there was always someone to care for my mother.\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, in November 2014, I lost my mother too. I still live with my grandparents and try to think of everything good and to dream. It\u2019s hard to bear all these difficulties, but I should be strong and realize my goals. From childhood, my mother wanted me to be well-educated, financially independent, and morally and physically strong. I believe I can do it!\r\n\r\n\"Academic freedom, freedom from corruption, and academic honesty, especially on the teachers\u2019 side, is a great example for Central Asia of how institutions can be of a great benefit to society! It is really inspiring to be together with great people and extraordinary students from many different countries. Great international and local teachers help us see where we stand, in terms of knowledge, and where we should aim. \r\n\r\n\"Currently Kiva is a chance for me to keep studying at AUCA and continue achieving goals by myself.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1805094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher

She is 49 years old, but she still doesn't rest in working for the well-being of her family. \n\nThe goals Catarina sets herself in life, she achieves. For a long time she longed to have a corn mill, so she decided to look for a loan and she got one, with which she installed her mill. This was her first loan, without which she wouldn't have been able to buy the mill. Now she has a source of income. \n\nThis year Catarina has decided to buy a piece of land to leave to her children as their inheritance. For this reason she is looking for a second loan. As she feels capable of paying this second loan from her business, her challenge is to get the loan in order to make this purchase.\n\nCatarina says that the loans are really good because through them you can achieve many things in life. Catarina will continue supporting her family as far as she can while God gives her life. Another of Catarina's big dreams is to buy a motorbike taxi to be able to set up a second

resources. She is single, and lives with four siblings and her parents. They have a family shop and they also make hammocks.  \r\n\r\nMartha and her family have had a small shop in their house for 2 years, where they sell basic consumer goods, and they have also made silk and poly-silk hammocks since she was 11 years old. They don't have a work timetable. She looks after the shop all day and makes the hammocks at the same time. \r\n\r\nMartha is asking for a loan to buy silk and other materials with which to make the hammocks so that they have sufficient material to satisfy their customers in terms of hammock production. This will allow them to continue making this economic income in their household, to cover the basic costs of living.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of being able to expand the hammock business and improve the inventory of the family shop in order to continue supporting her family and be able to improve bit by bit her quality of life and that of her family. Furthermore, next year she would like to go back to studying, in order to finish her basic education.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":654.07,"image":{"id":1802806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Vulnerable

who has 3 children and lives in the village of Chogoria in the Chuka area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nAt a young age Fredrick watched people in his village mobilize to replace traditional thatched roofs with waterproof corrugated iron. The memory of this collective effort led him to join Kaibu self-help group. For the past year, Fredrick has been actively involved in mixed farming. Because he is from rural Kenya, gender roles still adhere, and men do the heavy work. This has not been a setback as Fredrick has been able to make great profits in crop and goat farming. \r\n\r\nChuka is one of the places with conditions that favor horticulture farming: good climate, good soils, a transport system, and a market. Fredrick has always wanted to diversify and start horticultural farming, but the biggest challenge he has been facing is lack of funds. He is therefore requesting a loan to start horticultural farming. \r\n\r\nThrough the Kaibu self-help group, whose members co-guarantee each other to secure a loan, Fredrick joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports young and enterprising farmers. With your loan he intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers, and potatoes. Proximity to an airstrip will allow him to transport the produce faster to an international market, hence enabling him to earn more money. \r\n\r\nThis loan will improve Fredrick\u2019s living conditions and secure the future of his children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":359.67,"image":{"id":1805218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-29T19:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-28T19:20:20Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.58,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.57,"local_amount":8233.69,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":8297.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265044},{"amount":83.71,"local_amount":7610.41,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":7669.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459673},{"amount":89.75,"local_amount":8281.83,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:13Z","rounded_local_amount":8346.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.35,"payment_id":696587768},{"amount":92.06,"local_amount":8571.43,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:42Z","rounded_local_amount":8638.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.23,"payment_id":731022888}],"funded_date":"2015-02-26T01:20:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nathan Tichenor","image":28733}},{"id":833898,"name":"Mwanaidi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanaidi is a married woman and has two school going children.

coined this quote and he uses it every day to inspire his clients through health and fitness. \r\n\r\nHe moved to San Diego nearly 20 years ago, after almost completing law school in Brazil.  Wanting to get away, he visited San Diego for a vacation and decided to stay.  Always into fitness and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, it was the completion of his first IronMan that led him to consider it as a career. \r\n\r\nHe got a job at a local athletic club and received his personal training certifications.  He worked there for nearly four years, but always wanted to do more.  For Marcelo, it\u2019s not strictly about fitness.  He incorporates mindset, nutrition, and fitness into his personal health\/lifestyle coaching philosophy.  During his time at the athletic club, he built up some clients who fell in love with his approach. \r\n\r\nMissing his family and friends back in Brazil, he decided to return, not quite certain where he would eventually end up. Marcelo stayed in Brazil for one year, worked with some very high end clients in Rio, and then moved back to San Diego with a three year plan to open his own facility.  Upon his arrival back, he got a job at La Jolla Sporting Club, and started working as a personal trainer.  \r\n\r\nAt that time, he was conducting his sessions at the gym and paying to use the facilities.  The gym recently asked for a higher percentage of his total take, so he has decided to move out to become his own boss. He now rents a small studio where he sees two clients.  He also travels to his other client's homes and conducts his classes there.  \r\n\r\nNow that Marcelo is transitioning away from the gym, he needs support in buying some basic equipment and to help with renting his space.

In this bad condition in which she lives with her children, Hayila hopes to open her own business as a small grocery to provide her family with a better living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1805379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Islamic Finance"],"use":"to purchase new beds and furniture for the house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Sana'a","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2015-01-29T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-28T22:00:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saleh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rawdha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hayila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ghanj","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":170000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":21460},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":21220},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":21220},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":21220},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":21220},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":21220},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":21220},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":21220}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.98},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.86},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100.98,"local_amount":21460,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:00:15Z","rounded_local_amount":21697.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636140388},{"amount":99.86,"local_amount":21220,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":21454.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650499690},{"amount":99.86,"local_amount":21220,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-25T12:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":21454.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665378575},{"amount":99.86,"local_amount":21220,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-29T12:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":21454.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681273407},{"amount":99.86,"local_amount":21220,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-21T12:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":21454.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696483339},{"amount":99.86,"local_amount":21220,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-23T12:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":21454.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711392594},{"amount":99.86,"local_amount":21220,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-28T12:11:26Z","rounded_local_amount":21454.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730915415},{"amount":99.86,"local_amount":21220,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-01T13:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":21454.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752006561}],"funded_date":"2015-02-26T03:45:11Z","paid_date":"2015-12-01T13:11:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":833968,"name":"Lona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lona is a 35-year-old, married woman and a mother of four children, from Mundri.

Her partner works at a gas station in the neighborhood.  \r\n\r\nJessica is a great stay-at-home mom who built a corral where she raises poultry and pigs so she can earn something on her own and help her husband with the household expenses while raising their children.  She buys her animals when they are young, feeds them for three to four months, and when they are heavy enough she sells them to many dealers who come to her house to buy her animals.

He is arguably among the most successful clients of Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that deals only with smallholder farmers in rural parts of Kenya. Kale is Robert\u2019s main produce. He sells more than 15 kgs of kale every day. Back in 2000, Robert practiced traditional farming with little knowledge and no financing at all. He was growing only half an acre of maize per season. The returns were so meager that he could barely fend for himself. He kept maize farming for years without turning a profit until 2008, when he switched to kale farming and dairy farming and there was light at the end of the tunnel for Robert. Today, Robert is a full-fledged entrepreneur. He has been provided with technical guidance, training programs and exposure visits. He has already serviced other asset-based loans fully from Juhudi Kilimo. To capitalize more on returns from the booming kale farming, Robert is seeking a loan of KES 60,000 to build a greenhouse. Unlike his competition, Robert conducts proper soil preparation and uses modern farming techniques to ensure high-quality produce. By doing this, he has created a name for himself and a demand for his produce. Your support will contribute greatly to Robert achieving his goal, which is to expand the greenhouse. In the future, he is also planning to introduce the zero grazing method, intensify his kale farming, and start value addition."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":424.22,"image":{"id":1805413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To construct a greenhouse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-29T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-28T23:20:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.13,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":88.72,"local_amount":7886.63,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":8131.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265045},{"amount":66.64,"local_amount":5923.15,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":6107.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601229},{"amount":37.91,"local_amount":3395.83,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3501.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.29,"payment_id":681378101},{"amount":7.66,"local_amount":690.23,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:13Z","rounded_local_amount":711.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.11,"payment_id":696587769},{"amount":25.17,"local_amount":2338.65,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2411.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.14,"payment_id":711506076},{"amount":191.99,"local_amount":17474.12,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":18016.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.59,"payment_id":731022889}],"funded_date":"2015-02-20T16:32:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":832724,"name":"Miguel Angel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miguel Angel tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero, vive en casa familiar con sus padres en el distrito de Cayalt\u00ed que se encuentra ubicado en la provincia de Chiclayo, regi\u00f3n Lambayeque, en la costa norte de Per\u00fa.

For financial reasons, she was unable to study and only completed her first year of schooling. Her spouse is a person dedicated to farming just like she is. Planting and cultivating coffee is the source of financial income in their home where their 4 children live. Three of them are studying, and only get involved in the different farming activities that are possible while the harvest season approaches and workers are contracted to make the harvest of coffee more efficient.\r\n\r\nAs it was mentioned earlier, there is no other form of income besides the occupation of coffee planting, which she learned at an early age in the company of her parents. Juana is requesting the financial support to buy fertilizers, compost, liquid plant food, and pay for manual labor to clean and fertilize the property which is approximately 4 plots of land.\r\n\r\nShe mentions that with this financial support she will improve the property, and the harvest will be more fruitful because of the attention, care and protection that it will be given. This will increase the productivity and improve the earnings, which will help her to have a better quality of life and continue improving her business. Her short term goals are to give her property the personalized attention and protection it needs in order to get ahead. Through her earnings she wants to support her children in their goals and dreams as well as continue strengthening the family legacy."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1803560,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizers, compost, liquid plant food, and pay for manual labor to help with planting coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2015-01-30T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-01T01:40:03Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":14000},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":14000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-26T00:01:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Urry","image":1670999}},{"id":826562,"name":"Arroyo Mexico Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The members of Arroyo Mexico Group are 8 heads of family that have installed, in their houses, Small Solar Home Systems (SSHS) which they were gathering when the picture was taken, to have a basic electricity service.

She gets the best feed and medical care Lucy can provide. However, her biggest challenge is raising capital. Lucy has a sound investment plan that will push her to the next level. \r\n\r\nLucy is seeking a loan through Kiva to purchase a water tank. Constant availability of water at her homestead will make work very easy for her. Her farm animals and poultry will have a constant flow of drinking water, her family will have water for domestic use at the doorstep, and the crops on the farm will grow green and healthy through irrigation. Lucy wants to harvest rain water that always goes to waste and store it in the water tank for future use. \r\n\r\nWith your contribution, Lucy will seek to increase the number of animals on her farm because her animals will no longer have the challenge of no drinking water. This loan will improve her living conditions, and she will secure the future of her children and grandchildren.
