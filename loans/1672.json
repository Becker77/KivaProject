Their monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS), and they also work a 1.30 hectare plot of land, on which they grow barley.  With the goal of developing her business further, Zhenishbu has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 35,000 som (KGS) to buy heifers to increase her head of livestock.

Thanks to her hard work, Kenzhey now has two cows and 11 sheep on her farm.  She sells milk daily and she also works a 8.5 hectare plot of land, on which she grows wheat, barley, potatoes and sainfoin.  Her monthly income is 16,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of improving her farm's output, Kenzhey has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy bulls to increase her head of livestock.

She tells us that she became a member of Pro Mujer two years ago, after being invited by a friend who is a client of the organization. Ms. Paola currently runs a business selling beauty products, which she established after observing her friend, who successfully sold the same products. She then decided to invest a small sum on the business. The current loan is intended to increase her inventory (purchase beauty products for sale) for the convenience of her clients. This work enables her to generate income to financially support her family, as she is single. When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she stated that she liked the health services offered by the institution.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4775,"image":{"id":1803754,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

On the farm, she grows various crops and keeps dairy cattle and poultry. For the last six years, she has made money selling her farm's produce and engaging in other side businesses. She feels passionate about farming but her business is facing challenges such as the high cost of inputs and occasional drought. \r\n\r\nStella is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. To Stella, the upside of focusing more on her poultry business is that it is not very much effected by the major challenges of high costs of farm inputs and drought. Poultry feed is readily available. Poultry also lay eggs regardless of time of year or season. This investment will provide a certain source of income all year round.

He has five children aged 23, 20, 16, 13 and 12. He has a fishing business.\r\n\r\nHe is a good father, and is enterprising, independent, reliable, responsible and hard-working. He carries on his business in the town of Corpachilaya on the shores of the sacred lake Titicaca. This is an agricultural region dedicated to rearing livestock such as cattle, sheep and llamas. The people live off fishing and local cereals and vegetables, such as quinoa, chu\u00f1o, beans and potatoes. The climate is cold and dry, with daytime temperatures varying between 1-12 degrees centigrade, and the sun beating down on the land.\r\n\r\nFernando is dark-skinned and short with short black hair. His mother tongue is Aymara, the language spoken in his region, and he also speaks Spanish, especially when trading. He shares his life with his children, who work in agriculture and study at school. His eldest son is already independent. They live in a house made of bricks, with a corrugated roof, an electricity supply, and a water well. \r\n\r\nFernando has a business fishing pejerrey in his small boat with a net. Fishing on Lake Titicaca is one of the most beautiful forms of fishing as it is done by small-scale fishermen who respect the lake and the lake bed. The fishing method used consists of throwing a 30-metre-long net into the lake. The lake sinks to the bottom, and is left for the day. The following day it is brought up, without trawling or destroying the lake bed. What's more, the net is designed to only catch the right size and species of fish.\r\n\r\nFernando explains \u201cpejerrey fish are my specialty. I only catch that variety because I have regular customers\". His dream is to have a fishmonger's.\r\nHe would like to buy more nets to catch pejerrey because the nets he has at the moment are damaged and he needs to renew them. This is his first series of loans with the institution in the ten years he has worked as a fisherman.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that Fernando is requesting a loan to buy nets to catch pejerrey fish to sell to his customers.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":354.94,"image":{"id":1790439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She only went to primary school because her parents' financial situation meant they couldn't keep supporting her education. She is married and the mother of five children, but only 2 are living with her and her husband. They help her with the field work when they are not in school. Rosa has been working in the fields since she was very young. It was her parents who involved her in this family economic activity. Her husband works as a school teacher, teaching classes in the community high school. The property where she grows coffee is in the same area as her house, which is built about 10 minutes away from the road. She gets up very early to do the housework, to feed her children and send them off to high school, as well as to tend to her husband, to later go to the land parcel and turn her attention to what it needs for its care. Rosa is asking for the loan from the COMIXMUL cooperative to buy fertilizer, compost, foliar spray, and more as well as to pay for labor to make better use of the materials. With this, she hopes to have better income for her family. Rosa dreams of seeing her children in a better financial situation with better work opportunities, as well as to sell her harvest at a good price to have good profit. This will help contribute to a full development of her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1803753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer, compost, and to pay for labor to help her coffee crop.

Meet Kenneth, a very industrious, honest and hardworking man from the Kericho area of Kenya, near the famous Rift Valley escarpment. Kenneth, 24, has been farming for the past eight years. Through these years, he has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in his village. He has been practicing mixed farming. His primary sources of income has been milk, eggs, tea, crops and some small business ventures that help him make ends meet. \r\n\r\nKenneth is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating his farm. That is why, every day, he wakes up very early to go to his farm to plow. Although he makes profits from farming, he is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase his income by selling cereals. That is why he is seeking this loan to buy cereals. \r\n\r\nKenya's Kericho area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Kenneth could increase his profits and satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Kenneth, but he now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring men farmers like him turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. \r\n\r\nKenneth believes that this loan will be of much help, and that he will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. He also believes that the extra income he earns will enable permanent change in his life and expand his business. Increased profits will allow Kenneth to repay this loan and secure the future of his school-going siblings and ageing parents."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":145.01,"image":{"id":1805636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-30T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-01T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.46,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kenneth","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.3,"local_amount":3226.57,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3326.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601232},{"amount":35.6,"local_amount":3189.66,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3288.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"payment_id":681378104},{"amount":34.61,"local_amount":3214.69,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3314.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.56,"payment_id":711506080},{"amount":36.04,"local_amount":3258.62,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3359.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.62,"payment_id":752111077}],"funded_date":"2015-02-06T23:06:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":833133,"name":"Edwin Alexander","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edwin, de 31 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta bachillerato, est\u00e1 soltero, no tiene hijos, pero si tiene su casa propia en el terreno de sus padres.\n\nEdwin, anteriormente se dedicaba a la agricultura, pero ahora trabaja en la zona urbana en proyectos y actividades que se presentan en la alcald\u00eda, \n\nPara llegar a su lugar de trabajo Edwin, tiene que caminar una distancia de 15 kil\u00f3metros y su horario de trabajo es de 8:00 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 4:30 de la tarde.\n\nEs por esa raz\u00f3n que est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito, para comprar una motocicleta para poder trasladarse hasta su trabajo y as\u00ed no sacrificarse mucho caminando esas grandes distancias.\n\nSu mayor sue\u00f1o es, poder tener su hogar con su familia y poder darles lo mejor y lo necesario.\n\n","en":"Edwin is 31 years old and studied until high school.

She has a secondary education and began raising livestock and planting crops in 1997, when she purchased two cows. Thanks to her hard work, Anarkul currently has sheep, three dairy cows, and three horses. She earns around 60,000 som (KGS) per month, mainly through milk sales. In order to expand her business, she applied for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) with Bai-Tushum Bank to buy feed for the livestock and more cows for dairy and meat.

Meet Joyce, an ever-smiling 30-year-old. She is a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Londiani, a remote village in Kericho. She is happily married and blessed with adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Kericho area is highly populated and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Joyce's biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to expand her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 60,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. For a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. \r\n\r\nThrough this loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profits and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry market to other markets. This will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying the loan, permanently changing her living conditions, and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":312.19,"image":{"id":1805658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-30T15:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-01T15:20:06Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.16,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2580.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2655.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2813.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2895.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2980.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3067.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3157},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3249.26},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3344.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3441.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3542.55},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3646.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3752.63},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3862.31},{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3975.18},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4091.32},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4210.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.51},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.85},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.02},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.45},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.72},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.03},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.81,"local_amount":6294.19,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6489.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265052},{"amount":12.7,"local_amount":1128.98,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1164.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459680},{"amount":77.91,"local_amount":6979.86,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":7196.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.61,"payment_id":681378105},{"amount":72.93,"local_amount":6775.75,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:35Z","rounded_local_amount":6986.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.3,"payment_id":711506081},{"amount":72.68,"local_amount":6571.98,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":6776.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.25,"payment_id":752111078}],"funded_date":"2015-02-22T10:21:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Neil Garvin","image":835015}},{"id":833828,"name":"Susana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susana is 49 years old and married with two children.

She has been doing this work for the last six years to provide for her family of four children. Her primary sources of income are milk and crops. <br \/><br \/>Tabitha enjoys farming a lot. Looking after her cattle, however, is quickly becoming a serious challenge. Her cattle stray from time to time from the designated grazing area into other people's farms. The consequences of this can be very severe, leading to disputes which can escalate to violence and hostility. Tabitha is seeking a loan to pay for fencing wire to fence her farmland. <br \/><br \/>The $25 dollar loan you make will enable Tabitha to have small paddocks created with the fences.

He has gained so much experience through those years of farming. David practices mixed farming.

Because of the passion he has for farming, he has even nicknamed one of his cows. He really enjoys taking care of his cows. <br \/><br \/>Although David has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious man. His farm has not been producing as much of a harvest because of the lack of fertilizer and good seeds and the presence of pests and diseases. That is why he is seeking a loan to buy farm implements and expand his horticulture farm. <br \/><br \/>Through the loan, David will be assured of a bumper harvest, and this will translate into more profits and cash.

years old and she is a widow whose children are all grown up and on their own.  She has a high school education and, as the main source of income for her family, she has been raising livestock and growing crops since 1995.  She started this business with the purchase of a cow and ten turkeys.  Thanks to her hard work, her farm now has three dairy cows and heifers and 150 turkeys.  She also has a rented 4-hectare plot of land and her own .40-hectare plot of land on which she grows clover, sunflowers and wheat.\r\n\r\nUruila sells 25 liters of milk a day.  Her farming activities bring her about 60,000 som (KGS) per month.  With the goal of developing her business further, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy poultry for resale.

with her spouse. She has a secondary education. It is hard to find work in the village, but it is necessary to support a family and raise children. This is why she has been farming for many years. Today she has six cows and 20 sheep on her farm, as well as a 1.80 hectare plot of land where she grows potatoes and clover. She also sells milk on a daily basis and her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). With the goal of expanding her business in the future, Zinat applied for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) with Bai-Tushum Bank to buy livestock and feed. She plans to use her profits to invest in additional livestock and save money to remodel her house.

She is grateful to Kiva and everyone who helped her with funding. Determination and hard work have allowed Jypar to develop her homestead through one dairy cow.

This place is known for its dynamism and the majority of its residents work in agriculture and raising animals, because the area has heavy vegetation. Adolfo lives in this place, is 44 years old and is in a commonlaw marriage from which he has 7 adult children, 3 of whom live with them. His wife is a homemaker. Adolfo works as a security guard for a private company and is applying for a loan so that his wife can use it for raising animals. He helped her build a small barn in which she raises chickens, purchasing these animals when they're still small and she takes care of them for a span of three months until they reach a sufficient weight. She subsequently sells them by the pound to residents of the community or delivers them to area shopkeepers. That's how she helps with household expenses since he doesn't make enough at his job. He'll use this loan to purchase chickens, feed and medicine for the animals. For two years he's been in the financing group and enjoys it because of the additional loans that the institution offers.

The majority of its inhabitants work in agriculture or cattle rearing, as there is a lot of countryside in the area. Carmen is the home of 38-year-old Luisa, who is married with three children who go to primary or secondary school. Luisa' husband is a builder. She has always liked to work so she could help her husband with the household expenses. For over a year now, she has been running a small grocery shop from her home, selling basic necessities such as meat and vegetables. She set up her business with one of the loans which she obtained through the group and she has used the subsequent loans to stock up with the things she needs to attract more customers and make good profits. She will use this loan to buy rice, sugar, oil and other goods with which to stock her shop. She has been a member of the Credit Group for more than 3 years and she likes it because it was because of their loans that she was able to set up her business.  Her dream is to keep expanding her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1803921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" to buy rice, sugar, oil, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Carmen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2015-01-30T22:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-01T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa Yajhaira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":661.49,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165.36,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624232553},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110.24,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636218296},{"amount":112.49,"local_amount":110.24,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":112.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649569942},{"amount":112.48,"local_amount":110.24,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:20:17Z","rounded_local_amount":112.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665050478},{"amount":112.48,"local_amount":110.24,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":112.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681348315},{"amount":56.3,"local_amount":55.17,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:53:44Z","rounded_local_amount":56.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696558686}],"funded_date":"2015-02-13T17:51:35Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:53:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Crossfield","image":null}},{"id":834354,"name":"Martina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martina is a 43-year-old married mother of five children who are all in school.

She also has a small farm in her house where she breeds chickens.

familias que se dedicaban al cultivo de pl\u00e1tano, mango, naranja, lim\u00f3n los cuales sal\u00edan a vender a poblaciones vecinas. Con el paso del tiempo, la ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar se posicion\u00f3 en el primer lugar de producci\u00f3n. En la entrada de la comunidad se puede ver un ingenio. Las integrantes del grupo de pr\u00e9stamo y sus actividades son:\n\nIrma, Delfina, Paula - Ropa \nMayra, Alma -Servicio De Internet\nMar\u00eda - Calzado \nShely - Acero Inoxidable Y Oro Laminado\nVirginia - Hamacas \nViridiana \u2013 Comida\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Virginia es una mujer muy comprometida con su familia. Los 7 a\u00f1os que tiene de radicar en la comunidad los ha dedicado a la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de hamacas, catres y sillones tejidos con hilo el cual compra en grandes cantidades en Chiapas (un estado distinto de donde ella vive) obteni\u00e9ndolo a mejor precio ya que los proveedores le conocen por ser originaria de ese lugar. Actualmente, dos de sus hijas viven con ella mientras que su hijo vive con su abuela en Chiapas. \"Quiz\u00e1 suene peligroso mas no lo es, yo aprend\u00ed a tejer las hamacas en el reclusorio cuando visitaba a un pariente que se encontraba preso\". Actualmente Virginia sigue yendo al reclusorio a ense\u00f1ar a algunos reclusos a tejer, a aprender nuevas t\u00e9cnicas de ellos o a comprar las bases de los catres que tambi\u00e9n se fabrican dentro y que ella necesita para hacer sus productos.\n\nLas inversiones m\u00e1s grandes del negocio de Virginia las hace en la compra de hilo, por lo que los pr\u00e9stamos han representado un gran apoyo para mantener su actividad. Esta vez no es la excepci\u00f3n, pues necesita nuevamente capital para hilo y guardacabos para ofrecer con ellos una mayor durabilidad de los brazos de las hamacas.\n\n\u201cLas hamacas son f\u00e1ciles de transportar, el cliente suele relajarse al acostarse en una hamaca. Si bien hoy en d\u00eda pocas personas valoran el trabajo que realizamos quienes tejemos hamacas a mano, tambi\u00e9n hay quienes s\u00ed muestran aprecio y respeto por las artesan\u00edas\" eso es lo que a Virginia le agrada y comenta que su principal reto es vender las hamacas al precio justo pues hay quienes no quieren pagar por su valor y a ello se enfrenta d\u00eda con d\u00eda.\n\nEl grupo agradece a VisionFund por los pr\u00e9stamos otorgados pues con ellos cada una ha logrado el crecimiento de su actividad.\n\n*En la imagen se puede apreciar en el fondo algunas m\u00e1quinas que conforman el peque\u00f1o cibercaf\u00e9 de do\u00f1a Paula, tambi\u00e9n se observa un perezoso azul el cual teji\u00f3 la se\u00f1ora Virginia quien viste de blusa amarilla.\n","en":"The community where the group Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n is located was founded by families devoted to the cultivation of bananas, mangoes, oranges, and lemons that they sell in neighboring towns. Over time, sugarcane became their number one product. There is a sugar factory at the entrance of the community. The members of this loan group and their activities are:\r\n\r\nIrma, Delfina, and Paula sell clothing.\r\nMayra and Alma provide Internet services.\r\nMaria sells footwear.\r\nShely works with stainless steel and plated gold.\r\nVirginia works with hammocks.\r\nViridiana sells food.\r\n\r\nVirginia is a woman who is very committed to her family. She has been making and selling hammocks, cots, and chairs with woven strings for seven years. She buys materials in bulk in Chiapas (a different state from where she lives) where she gets it at a better price. Her suppliers know her to be a native of her hometown. Currently, two of her daughters live with her whole a son lives with his grandmother in Chiapas. \u201cIt may sound dangerous but it is not, I learned to weave hammocks in the prison while visiting a relative who was imprisoned.\u201d Currently, Virginia continues to go to the prison to teach some inmates to knit, learn new techniques, or to buy the supplies for the cots that they also make in prison and that she needs to make her products.\r\n\r\nThe largest business investment that Virginia makes is thread. The loans have been a great support to maintain her activity. This time is no exception, she needs capital again to buy thread and thimbles to make the handles of the hammocks more durable. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe hammocks are easy to transport, the clients relax by lying in a hammock. While today, few people appreciate the work we who weave hammocks by hand do, there are those who do show appreciation and respect the craft.\u201d That\u2019s what Virginia likes and she says her main challenge is to sell the hammocks at a good price because there are those who do not want to pay the full price. She confronts this problem daily.\r\n\r\nThe group thanks VisionFund for the loans granted to them because each has increased their business.\r\n\r\n*In the picture, you can see the machines that Paula has in her Internet cafe. You can also see a blue knitted lounge chair made by Virginia who wears a yellow blouse.

Her income from her store is a stable source of funds to sustain her family's basic needs and for the education of her children. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. \r\n\r\nWilma dreams of having a bigger general store and hopes that all her children will finish college and have their own careers. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies.\r\n\r\n*All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital  and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1805994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The remaining group members will use their funds to buy high-quality feed (which costs $20 to feed 100 ducks for five days). Sin Ku village is an agricultural community where many people are farmers who grow rice and plant seasonal vegetables and fruits such as bananas and coconuts. Those without arable land grow livestock, including ducks and chickens.  Some also raise pigs as a way to set aside some savings. The picture above shows four CBO members, U Tin, U Ngwe, Daw Nwe and Daw Moe. U Tin (second from the left) is 62 years old and owns a two-acre farm. He is married with two daughters. In addition to planting seasonal fruits on his land, U Tin raises ducks and pigs. His wife takes care of the ducks, and they also run a small grocery store out of their house.

This place is known for being very dynamic where the majority of the inhabitants work in agriculture and raising animals, and for being a zone with a lot of vegetation. \r\n\r\nMartha lives in this place. She is 50 years old, married, and from this relationship has 10 adult children who are independent. Her husband is a farmer.\r\n\r\nMartha is a good wife who likes to work to get ahead. She has a small farm where she raises chickens. She purchases these animals when they are still small, raises them for a period of three or four months until they have an adequate weight, and later sells them by the pound to neighbors in the area or brings them to business people in this place. She also gives part of the loan so her husband uses it in agriculture. He grows corn, peanuts, and vegetables in the winter season. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to purchase chickens, chicken feed and medicine, seeds, and fertilizer for the crops. She has been in the communal bank group for 4 years and she likes it for the help that she gets with the loans. Her dream is to have the health to continue on.

Daw Mar (first from left in the photo) is 38 years old and married with two children. She and her husband rent five acres of land to plant seasonal vegetables. While her husband takes on the majority of farming duties, Daw Mar is responsible for looking after their 100 ducks. Like other members, Daw Mar will use these funds to purchase ducks, increasing her income from more duck's eggs.

She will then set it up in the sewing shop to make her apparel.

Proof of this is that she invested her first loan to buy footwear through catalogs and perfumes to sell. With the profits she obtained from this, she helped her husband to pay their household's expenses and sent their two children to school. Later, she invested the earnings plus another loan from VisionFund to start to raise pigs and sell their meat. After two years, she opened a small grocery store in her home, which is the business in which she spends most of her time working. \r\n\r\nFor Azucena it is essential to maintain a variety or products, which is why she needs a new loan to buy rice, beans, soup, oil, eggs, crackers, soft drinks, juices, and some cleaning products. Today,  \u201cChena\u201d, as everyone know her, also sells household products as well as continues to meat that customers order. With part of her earnings and her husbands salary from his job in the sugar factory, they have been able to offer their two children a better quality of life. Their children are still in school and they help Azucena with housework in the afternoon. \r\n\r\n\u201cThanks to God and each one of the loans that have been offered to us, my store has been stable, small, but offering the products that the neighbors are most looking for.\"\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in front of the window where Chena attends to customers Monday through Sunday, from 7:00 am to 8:00 pm.

This new loan will go to buy additional medicine and grocery products, which she also sells. Her customers will likely buy more items if she has more of her products displayed in her store. An increase in sales will also result in a significant increase in profit. This will result in her business becoming viable and sustainable. Simultaneously, she could sustain the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nAside from growing her business, Norma wants to succeed in her future plans and have financial freedom. She meets every week with her *co-fellowship members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Meet Erick, a hardworking, dedicated and honest 23-year-old dairy farmer. \r\n\r\nAs the key breadwinner for his parents, he farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Nandihills in the famous Rift valley region of Kenya. For the past five years, he has been practicing mixed farming. His primary sources of income are milk, eggs and crop selling. He also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income he earns through farming. Erick passionately loves dairy farming. The biggest challenge he faces is feeding his cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. He is seeking a loan to buy another quality breed of dairy cow. \r\n\r\nErick intends to buy not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will produce between 15 and 25 liters of milk a day. The selling price for milk is 40 KES per liter, and with this loan, he would make a cool US $11 per day. Before Erick joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports smallholder farmers with technical and financial solutions, he considered dairy farming to be a mediocre fallback occupation that did not have any future promise for income generation. After training, Erick now believes that dairy farming is the business to go into if you want a rather less rough way into the millionaires' club. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Erick will increase his income from milk selling and his cows will have more food to eat and never reject food. The key to high yield in milk production is proper feeding of the cows, and through this loan, Erick will achieve this. An increase in income will allow Erick to improve his living conditions and secure the future of his children. His dream is to continue improving his dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards. Erick fears that his dreams might not be realized if Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders cease to provide its reliable market channel, credit facility, and services that he requires to grow his dairy enterprise.\r\n\r\nSupport this Kenyan entrepreneur with a $25 loan!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":316.68,"image":{"id":1806103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-31T07:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-02T07:40:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.95,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":41400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2893.58},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3018.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3106.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3197.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3290.94},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3387.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3486.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3587.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3692.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3800.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3911.84},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4026.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.64},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.37},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.61},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.88},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.56,"local_amount":5365.67,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5642.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265056},{"amount":32.94,"local_amount":2871.37,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3019.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601234},{"amount":12.57,"local_amount":1095.43,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1151.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459685},{"amount":43.22,"local_amount":3796.72,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3992.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.34,"payment_id":681378108},{"amount":20.12,"local_amount":1779.67,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1871.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.3,"payment_id":696587780},{"amount":56.72,"local_amount":5166.59,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5432.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.56,"payment_id":711506084},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":3965.68,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4170.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.06,"payment_id":731022899},{"amount":40.16,"local_amount":3560.1,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3743.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.69,"payment_id":752111081}],"funded_date":"2015-02-26T16:41:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":833644,"name":"Tito Jonas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Tito de 55 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su esposa, desde hace varios a\u00f1os se dedica a la  crianza de ganado lechero (producci\u00f3n y venta de leche)  en la zona donde reside, tiene muy buena clientela ya que ha sabido ganarse la confianza de sus clientes.

The women have already finished their first loan from Kiva, which allowed them to increase the inventory of the products that they offer by a little bit and to improve their incomes even more.  They have also been able to take care of their children's basic necessities.\r\n\r\nMarisol is a member of the SHES group.
