His work as a cobbler has helped him to get his family ahead and pay for his younger daughter's university studies.\r\n\r\nDon Miguel is asking for a loan so that he can buy materials he needs for repairing his clients' shoes and so in this way do a better job. Don Miguel's goals are, through the fruits of his labour and efforts, that his daughter will get her degree. His future plans are to always continue working at his business and assist his customers with quality service and warmth."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1804824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy materials for repairing shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2015-01-31T15:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-02T15:20:11Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel Angel \t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":135.1,"local_amount":135.1,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":135.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624462000},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-19T11:21:17Z","rounded_local_amount":133.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636864885},{"amount":131.57,"local_amount":131.57,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":131.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649617123}],"funded_date":"2015-01-31T17:06:25Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T14:03:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Brown","image":1233582}},{"id":833666,"name":"Rosalia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosal\u00eda de 44 a\u00f1os de edad, es una persona que  estudi\u00f3 noveno grado, sus padres le ense\u00f1aron las actividades de la ganader\u00eda y la agricultura  y es una persona acompa\u00f1ada, su esposo le ayuda en los trabajos de siembra y del cuido de las vacas que poseen.\n\t\t\nRosal\u00eda se dedica a trabajar en las parcelas junto a su esposo durante la ma\u00f1ana y en el transcurso de la tarde se dedican a orde\u00f1ar las vacas para vender la leche entre sus vecinos \n\nEste cr\u00e9dito lo necesita para comprar una novilla que en un futuro le servir\u00e1 para producir m\u00e1s leche para el negocio que posee.\n\nSus planes son compras m\u00e1s animales con las ganancias que obtenga de su trabajo.\n","en":"Rosal\u00eda is 44 years old.

of the land; and almost all the food that people eat comes from people who sell in the rural marketplace,\u201d says Khadija, a 26-year-old mixed farmer based in Magutu, a remote village in Kerugoya area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nKhadija has a husband, and at home they have one child. For the last 5 years, Khadija has been actively engaged in mixed farming. She sells her farm\u2019s produce at a local market near her home. Her main income sources include milk, eggs and vegetables. Her in-depth knowledge of her environment has enabled Khadija to get her hands on numerous small business opportunities. \r\n\r\nKhadija is seeking a loan to purchase more poultry.

She sends you her thanks for your generosity because her previous loan which she used to purchase additional grocery items needed to increase her product inventory. The loan also helped her provide for the educational expenses of her children, and pay for their daily needs.\r\n\r\nShe is very positive that she can improve her business, if you will lend her 20,000 PHP. This new loan will go to additional inventory of food items, toiletries, and beverages. Her customers will likely buy more items if she has more of her products displayed at her store. An increase in sales will also result in a significant increase in profit, which will also result in her business becoming viable and sustainable. Simultaneously, she will be able to sustain the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nAside from her variety store, Sarlyn also operates her direct selling business for additional profit.

For the past years, Jane has been actively involved in mixed farming, and because she is from rural Kenya, gender roles still adhere and women do the heavy work of fetching and carrying water and wood, in addition to household chores, childcare and tending crops. Many are left to run farms alone while their husbands migrate in search of paid employment. \r\n\r\nThis has not been a setback because Jane has been making great profits in farming. Kerugoya is one of the places with conditions that favor horticulture farming: good climate, soils, transport system, and market. Jane has always wanted to diversify and start horticultural farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is lack of funds. She is therefore requesting a loan to start horticultural farming. \r\n\r\nThrough the Ngariama self-help group, whose members co-guarantee each other to secure a loan, Jane joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance organization that supports young and enterprising farmers. With your loan she intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers and potatoes. Proximity to an airstrip will allow her to transport the produce faster to an international market, hence enabling her to make more money. \r\n\r\nThis loan will improve Jane's living conditions and secure the future of her children. Jane has a firm goal to get her project ahead, since she wants to become a successful business owner and guarantee a better quality of life and well being for her family, and she knows that with the Kiva lenders and Juhudi Kilimo, she can achieve all of this and more."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":335.8,"image":{"id":1806287,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticultural farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-31T16:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-02T16:00:13Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.89,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2795.73},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2916.41},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3001.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3089.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3179.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3272.57},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3368.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3466.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3567.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3672.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3779.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3890.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.82},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.89},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.14},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.91,"local_amount":6747.37,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":6965.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265061},{"amount":32.97,"local_amount":2931.01,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3025.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459689},{"amount":72.18,"local_amount":6458.85,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6667.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.48,"payment_id":681378111},{"amount":71.5,"local_amount":6635.2,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":6849.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.15,"payment_id":711506087},{"amount":78.35,"local_amount":7076.41,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":7304.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.26,"payment_id":752111084}],"funded_date":"2015-02-09T20:02:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":834611,"name":"Alita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alita is 53 years old and married with one child.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by farming sugarcane in the Philippines.

in the Nandi hills area of Kenya. Today, this humble mother sells milk, eggs, tea and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has of farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. <br \/><br \/>Dairy farming is close to her heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit. She is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. <br \/><br \/>Through the loan, she will have a humble time milking and feeding her cow.

progress.She is based in Koibatek, a remote village in the Kapsowar area of Kenya, an area with fertile soil famous for dairy farming. The region's staple food is \u201cMursik,\u201d a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from milk. \r\n\r\nJanet has been practicing mixed farming for the past 10 years. Selling eggs and milk has earned her a decent income. She also engages in another business to make ends meet. Janet passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every morning to milk her cow. While this humble mum has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. \r\n\r\nJanet is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. With this loan, she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This will help fully satisfy the demand. Through Kiva Field Partner Juhudi Kilimo, she attended training sessions and was taught financial management skills. This will help her save more money, repay the loan fully, and improve her living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":238.12,"image":{"id":1806295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy another quality dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-31T16:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-02T16:20:05Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.19,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":32050,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2268.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2334.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2402.79},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2473.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2545.28},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2619.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2696.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2775.02},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2856.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2939.62},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3025.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3113.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.23,"local_amount":5515.41,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5526.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265062},{"amount":55.29,"local_amount":5063.39,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5073.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459690},{"amount":58.15,"local_amount":5396.44,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5407.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.78,"payment_id":696587785},{"amount":62.26,"local_amount":5830.06,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5841.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.41,"payment_id":731022903}],"funded_date":"2015-01-31T19:59:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":833674,"name":"Mart\u00edn De Jes\u00fas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Martin de 57 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casado y su esposa se dedica a los oficios dom\u00e9sticos.\n\n\nMartin se levanta a las 6:30 a.m. para ir a trabajar durante todo el d\u00eda en construcci\u00f3n en los alrededores de su localidad o afuera, fue la necesidad que lo llev\u00f3 a trabajar en esta actividad y le ha servido como medio para cubrir los gastos del hogar.  \n\n \n\t\u00c9l solicita este cr\u00e9dito para comprar un veh\u00edculo y poder movilizarse hacia su trabajo y en su tiempo libre realizar viajes para obtener un ingreso adicional.\n.\nSus planes son incursionar en la siembra de ma\u00edz u otros granos b\u00e1sicos.\n","en":"Martin is 57 years old and married, and his wife dedicates herself to domestic work.

Kenya. Annah is a lovely mother who has overcome this challenge and has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. Her primary source of income has been selling eggs, maize and milk, and also has a personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. \r\n\r\nAnnah, who is an ever-smiling farmer, has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans that farming is for the older generation. She passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early-riser and she wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cow. Although this humble mom has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. \r\n\r\nAnnah is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. Through the loan she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 litres of milk a day.

village in the Kitale area of Kenya. Today, this humble mother of four children sells milk, eggs and a variety of crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Taking care of her poultry is an activity that she finds very enjoyable, and feeding her poultry is her hobby. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in the Kitale area. Dorice has good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market - the demand is very high. Being a visionary woman, she has always wanted to increase her poultry, so now she is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Accessing financial services for women is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising women like Dorice can achieve their dreams and goals. Dorice believes that the key to increased egg production is proper feeding and good care. By ensuring that the poultry are fed well, she is guaranteed to reap the benefits. In addition to selling eggs and poultry, she will also sell poultry feathers that are commonly used to make earrings. The increased income will be used to improve her living conditions and to repay the loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":399.34,"image":{"id":1806430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-31T17:20:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-02T17:20:21Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.18,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dorice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.48,"local_amount":8486.7,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":8760.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262837},{"amount":65.92,"local_amount":5859.5,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:31Z","rounded_local_amount":6048.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601239},{"amount":74.39,"local_amount":6656.79,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":6871.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.5,"payment_id":681378113},{"amount":76.66,"local_amount":7113.91,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":7343.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.37,"payment_id":711506089},{"amount":81.71,"local_amount":7379.81,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":7617.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.31,"payment_id":752111086}],"funded_date":"2015-02-09T22:50:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":834579,"name":"Belinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Belinda is a married woman with two children, both of whom attend school.

","en":"Mar\u00eda used her first loan to buy agricultural supplies to be used for tending her coffee plantation with manure 18-46-0, fertiliser, foliar applications, lime and to pay workers. All of this meant that she could look after her crops better and make better use of the supplies. Thanks to the loan, her plot and business prospered and she was able to boost her income. As a result, she paid off the loan and expressed her thanks for the help she received. Mar\u00eda says that without the help from the COMIXMUL cooperative her hopes of expanding her business would have been lost because she did not want to  borrow from local moneylenders who would compromise the harvest and, with their high interest rates, she would be practically working for them. Now, for a second time, Mar\u00eda is applying for a loan to help her tend her coffee crops. She hopes that this will enable her to boost her income and achieve a better yield than last year so that she can provide a better life and future for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1804860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy manure, fertiliser and foliar applications and to pay workers to help her tend her coffee crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2015-01-31T17:20:26Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-02T17:20:26Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Esmeralda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-06T20:36:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Crossfield","image":null}},{"id":834711,"name":"Graciela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Graciela is 41 years old and describes herself as a happy person that enjoys working and playing volleyball.

The village was built following massive landslides that destroyed over half of the village of Antigua (Old) Santa Catariana Ixtahuacan, during the rains of Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Searching for higher ground the founders of Nueva Santa Catarina built the city at an elevation of 10,000 feet above sea level.\r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cFlor de Alejandria\u201d (Alexandria\u2019s Flower), is made up of seven women who live and work in Nueva Santa Catarina Ixtahuacan. The women mostly work with traditional textiles of the region, weaving and designing traditional Maya dresses, blouses and fabrics. One of Flor de Alejandria's seven members is Ana, a 42-year-old mother of three. Ana\u2019s primary business is buying traditional dresses and blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d from vendors in the surrounding communities, and then selling them for a profit. Currently, Ana travels every week to the pacific coast to sell the hand crafted textiles to clients in regions where the production of textiles is not as common. Ana plans to use this loan to purchase new huipiles and dresses to increase her inventory and stay current with the newest styles and designs. With this loan Ana will have access to higher quality textiles and a higher return on her investment.

She has a specialist high school education and is employed as a social worker. She also works in animal husbandry and agriculture as an additional source of income, a business she began 13 years ago. Her son helps her actively and happily with the farm work. Thanks to her hard work, she currently has eight cows and 11 sheep on her farm as well as 1.2 hectares of land where she grows hay for her own use. \r\n\r\nKulizar's monthly income is about 13,000 KGS, which isn't enough to cover the family's needs. Therefore, with the goal of further developing her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 35,000 KGS to purchase livestock feed, since this year, due to a drought, her own crops failed. She plans to put profits from the loan into further increasing her quantity of livestock and into acquiring feed for the whole winter."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1802206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

Most of the venders commute from surrounding rural communities to take advantage of the city\u2019s famous market. The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cAjkay,\u201d is made up of twelve women from one of the neighboring rural communities. \r\n\r\n\u201cAjkay\u201d is applying for their second loan funded by Kiva investors, after making their final payment on their previous loan at the end of January. The twelve women of the Trust Bank have all returned to continue working with Friendship Bridge to expand their businesses and improve their quality of life. Micaela, one of the younger members of \u201cAjkay\u201d at 20 years old, is entering her third loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. Micaela is requesting a loan to buy chickens and pigs to continue expanding her business of animal husbandry. Micaela has always worked with animals, gaining knowledge and experience, working with the animals on her family\u2019s property since she was very little. Micaela hopes that with the profit gained from her small animal husbandry business she can one day re-invest the money and open a small store. By investing in a small store, Micaela believes she will have a less volatile business. In order to one day open a small store, Micaela is determined to make the most of her existing business by increasing her inventory of animals. As part of a Friendship Bridge Trust Bank, Micaela will also receive monthly trainings in savings, business administration, health and women\u2019s rights from her loan officer, who is supporting her to achieve her ultimate goal. Kiva investors, by funding this loan, will help Micaela take the next step in her young business career. \r\n\r\nThank you, Kiva investors, for continuing to support the women of \u201cAjkay\u201d with affordable loans that improve their ability to create a sustainable and profitable business. We look forward to updating investors on Micaela\u2019s and the rest of \u201cAjkay's\" business successes.

She is married to Julius and they manage their household while operating a business. They work hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLory operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals in the evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a typical family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and meats costs less than raw food. Lory's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help Lory continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 18,000 loan to buy more ingredients such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nLory hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

Meet Ciciry. She is a 43-year-old farmer from Kiamutugu village, situated in the Central province of Kenya. She lives together with her handsome husband and children on a small piece of land, where she keeps poultry and grows a wide variety of crops. For ten years, her primary source of income has been eggs and horticultural produce. \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals to prevent these diseases. Ciciry made a decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help her improve her farming activities. Sometime last month, she applied for a loan to expand her horticulture farm. This will enable her to expand her operations to increase the overall output. \r\n\r\nThe additional income from the expansion will go to her children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is increasingly becoming prohibitive to low-income communities, especially in the rural areas. As a result, kids are forced to drop out to start working to contribute their earnings to their families. With your loan, Ciciry's children will acquire quality education that will act as a strong foundation for their bright future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":167.89,"image":{"id":1806406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To expand her horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-31T18:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-02T18:20:08Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ciciry","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1397.87},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500.82},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1544.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1589.82},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1684.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.32},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1783.98},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1836.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1889.78},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1945.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.73},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.41},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.95},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.07},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.26},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.95,"local_amount":3373.69,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3482.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265064},{"amount":16.49,"local_amount":1465.5,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459692},{"amount":36.09,"local_amount":3229.43,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3333.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.24,"payment_id":681378112},{"amount":35.75,"local_amount":3317.6,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3424.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.57,"payment_id":711506088},{"amount":39.17,"local_amount":3538.2,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3652.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.63,"payment_id":752111085}],"funded_date":"2015-02-01T01:10:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":834580,"name":"Mt Ulunguru Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is 46 years old and not married.

She works from 06am to 04pm daily, making sure her chicks and chickens get water and feed as required. She grows them from four to six weeks and then they are ready to sell. She makes a small return. This is due to poor sheds and a small number of chicks. To raise them in a good shed that has enough air and permanent power, she needs enough capital. To find a way to improve her business, she decided to approach Tujijenge Tanzania to look for financial support.\r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan from Kiva partner, Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the past loans, paid back in full, to recover her number of chicks because she had a small number of chicks. She managed to buy feed for her poultry business.

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cUntil 2011, my family had a happy and carefree life. My father was an ecologist and my mother worked at the local market. That year, my mother had a stroke, which was followed by surgery. It seemed like our lives had stopped for a moment waiting for her recovery. Time passed and we were happy to see her improvements. Not long after that, I felt sick and twice had a head operation. From that day, I was forced to forget about some of my hobbies and activities at school such as math, running, chemistry, biology, basketball, dancing and so on. Thanks to God, I am good now and my health allows me to be active.\r\n\r\nMy mother\u2019s health prevents her from working and she is a housewife. So my father is the only one with a full-time job in my family. We are four children: my elder two brothers, me and my little sister, who is still a schoolgirl. My brothers study at other universities and have part-time jobs in order to help my parents and to try to pay their university tuition by themselves. We live in a suburb of Bishkek and our house is really old. It is in need of repair but due to lack of money we aren\u2019t able to repair it. When I was child, our house seemed big to me but now there is hardly enough place for everyone. We feel uncomfortable to have guests and wish to build a bigger house when we get better.\r\n\r\nI thank Kiva lenders for giving me this great opportunity. I will try to study hard, not even for myself, but for my mother. I will do my best to keep her happy and not make her worry or upset because of me anymore.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1806206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Bienvenido and his wife are working hard with the determination of having more income than they currently have.\r\n\r\nTo improve his profit and to pay for the maintenance of the boarding house, Bienvenido would like to ask for loan assistance. An amount of PHP 50,000 could help him in the renovation and beautification of their place, so that his regular boarders will choose to stay there for a longer period of time. He will also use a portion of the loan to add up to the capital needed for his pillow-making canteen business. He sincerely lets you know his heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Bienvenido hopes that they could have more boarders who are trustworthy and disciplined.

Two of her children live with her, and for many years, they have helped her to raise livestock and to grow crops. Altynkul has been very successful: she currently owns two cows, one calf, eight sheep and two goats.  She makes a monthly income of about 8,000 som (KGS), which is still vastly insufficient to provide a decent life for herself and her family.  In order to further grow her business, Atynkul has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to buy a horse.  With the benefits from her loan, Altynkul is planning to expand her farming business and increase her family's

All her children are grown up, but her youngest son still lives with the family.  Erkingul has a secondary education.  She knows how to appropriately use and invest her money to achieve the goals that she has set for herself.  She has been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture since 1994, and this activity constitutes her family's main source of income.  She currently owns two cows with their calves, 10 sheep, one horse, and she also grows barley on 1.2 hectare of her own land.

Tajikistan.  She is 46 years old and the mother of four children.  Unfortunately, her husband passed away, and Roziya has had a very difficult time coping and raising her children by herself after her husband's death.  Her oldest son is now making a living abroad and helping the rest of the family.  Her second son is a student at the Pedagogical Institute in Dushanbe.  Her youngest two children are still in secondary school in their native district.\r\n\r\nRoziya grows crops on her own parcel of land. She started this activity seven years ago.  Her youngest children help her after school.  This farming activity is the family's main source of income.  Roziya is now planning to sow her land for the next harvest, but she doesn't have enough money to buy high-quality potato seeds and mineral fertilizers.

He is enterprising, independent, a good father, responsible and hard working. \r\n\r\nHis business is in the community of Colquemaya, located near the sacred Lake Titicaca. This is an agricultural area where they raise livestock: llamas, cattle, sheep and pigs. Fish, meat, and vegetables, tubers and grains from the region such as quinoa, freeze dried potato, broad beans and potatoes etc. are all consumed. The climate is cold and dry with a temperature that varies throughout the day from 1-12 degrees Celsius, when the sun\u2019s rays shine powerfully on the land.\r\n\r\nIsaac is dark-skinned and of short stature, with black hair. His native tongue is Aymara, which is spoken locally, and he speaks Spanish, which is widely spoken. He lives with his youngest son who works in the same business. They live in their own home, which is built of adobe and brick, and has well water and electricity.\r\n\r\nHis business is selling llama meat. This meat is higher in protein than other meats like beef, chicken, and pork. It has a low fat content, and doesn\u2019t contribute to raising cholesterol. It is healthful since it has no contagious diseases that can endanger human health. Jerky made by dehydrating and salting llama meat is very popular. \u201cLlama meat is very delicious, and it\u2019s part of our agriculture\u2026\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nCurrently, he does not have a meat saw. He works by hand, on the patio at his house, using a knife and a small axe. In spite of this his customers are loyal and steady. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to have a spacious butcher shop, and he hopes to buy a meat saw to provide his product more hygienically. This is the first loan cycle with the institution in the 6 years he\u2019s been doing this.\r\n\r\nThis is why Isaac is asking for a loan to buy a meat saw to sell llama meat

Flor de Mar\u00eda is a saleswoman who offers beauty products through catalogs.  Thanks to the first Kiva loan they received from Pana Pana, they were able to meet their goals, begin improving their incomes, and take care of a few basic necessities at home.  <br \/><br \/>Mery Luz is the coordinator of this solidarity group.  She is 30 years old, married, and has four school-age children.  Two years ago, she opened her small grocery store in the corridor of her home.  Her goal was to have her own source of income so that she could help with the household expenses.  Her husband is a traveling ice cream vendor.  Mery Luz is requesting a loan so that she can continue to increase the inventory of her grocery store.  This will allow her to sell more and serve more people.

Pipaldani is a remotely located rural village. The lady standing third from left with her hand raised in the photograph is Mandara. She is a very active and energetic lady. She lives with her husband, one son of nine years and a daughter of four years in a small hut. She belongs to a Below Poverty Line category family. The main source of income for Mandara is vegetable vending, which she has been running for the last eight years. Mandara brings vegetables from the nearest town and with a head load, goes to the nearest villages for door step vending. Presently, she is earning around 3,000 INR per month from this business, which is very hard for her to manage her family and think of the future. So to diversify her business for future development, this year she, along with the other 10 like-minded women of her village, formed a Self Help Group (SHG) named Jai Bharat to avail a loan from Mahashakti foundation. Mandara has decided to take a loan of 12,000 INR to purchase a piece of land for vegetable cultivation of her own. Her husband will manage the vegetable cultivation and she, in spite of procuring vegetables from the market, will sell her own products. She hopes this will help her to increase her income and help her to manage her family better than her present status. Mandara hopes to repair her house and give a better education to her children. \r\n\r\nThe other 10 members of the group are also involved in businesses like vegetable cultivation, goat rearing,

She is 25 years of old and lives with her husband and two small children. \r\n\r\nSurabhi has been running a press paper plate making unit in her house for the last five years with the help and support of her husband. Now she has two paper plate pressing machines. She has engaged two workers to manage her business. She supplies her products to the retailers of the same town and other villages within a 10 mile radius. She purchases raw materials like paper and polythene from the nearest wholesale market 200 kilometers away on a monthly basis.  She gets a monthly income of 6,000 INR from the above business. Out of this income, she is hardly able to manage her household and business expenses. Due to the quality of her product and timely delivery, the demand of her unit is growing day by day. But to meet the demands of the customers, finances are a problem for her. So she wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. With her present loan of 12,000 INR, Surabhi has planned to purchase another press machine and raw materials like paper roll, lamination paper etc. in bulk for the long term production and supply.  She is hopeful that this will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as well as generate more income by attracting more customers. Surabhi hopes to save enough to extend her existing house and better educate her children to lead a respectable life.\r\n \r\nOut of the other nine members of the group, three members are doing vegetable vending, another four members are doing push cart services and two  members are running a tailoring center and a general store.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1802364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase another press machine and raw materials like paper roll, lamination paper etc. in bulk for long term production and supply.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2015-02-01T10:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-03T10:30:02Z","loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bimala ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janaki ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jharana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jyoti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koushalya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luchana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manju ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padutula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Surabhi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-04T16:03:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":832725,"name":"Sairam Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mita, the headstrong and confident single woman, is a permanent resident of Titilagarh town in the Balangir district in Odisha, India.

She has engaged laborers for the preparation of stone chips. The stone chips prepared from the stone boulders are used inter-alia in the manufacture of concrete sleepers, construction of roads, bridges, buildings and other construction works. \r\n\r\nTapaswini has been doing this business for the last ten years and the earnings mean life is just hand to mouth for her family. In spite of regular earnings she is not able to improve her living conditions.

She is a kind-hearted woman, always in a positive mood, and very industrious. The couple has five grown children who are no longer in school but still live with their parents. Clara and Vicente have raised pigs and sheep for the past three years, a business that has worked out well and allowed the couple to meet their household budget. Clara cares for the animals while Vicente works in Mexico City. \r\n\r\nClara and Vicente first thought of raising livestock when one of their sons bought a piglet and the family was able to sell it for a good price when the animal was fully grown. Vicente and Clara then learned about VisionFund and decided to start raising livestock, obtaining a loan with their neighbors and using the funds to purchase some pigs and sheep. \r\n\r\nClara and Vicente now need to purchase more sheep. Do\u00f1a Clara is very grateful to both VisionFund and KIVA because the support of the two organizations have allowed her and her husband to earn steady income. They are now using some of that income for repairs to their home, and they hope to build more pens so that they can have more animals. \r\n\r\nDon Antonio and Mar\u00eda Agustina, the other mamebrs of Barrio El Toril, will use their share of the loan funds for the purchase of calves.  \r\n\r\nThis photograph was taken in the town, and you can see the Catholic Church in the background.

Since then, he has been making sales every afternoon in his garage, which he has adapted in such a way that he has been able to accommodate tables, two counters, a washroom, a grill, a refrigerator, nachos, a microwave, and a stereo, so that the customers may enjoy their food while listening to good music.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuan also has the support of his wife and daughters while making the food.  After preparing everything, he opens the door to the garage door at 7 P.M., which is a signal to his customers that they can start enjoying themselves.  Finally, the door is not closed until the last customer has gone. Juan Carlos says, \u201cI have defined my own style, and I make hamburgers that look like happy faces\u201d.\r\n\r\nJuan Carlos says that the loans have been very useful for him, as he has used them to purchase all the ingredients that he needs in great quantities to maintain his business at its best.  With his earnings, he has been able to provide his family with better living conditions, and he has made some renovations in the business.\r\n\r\nHe plans to invest the new loan that he is requesting in the purchase of bread, tortillas, ham, cheese, oil, potatoes, vegetables, nachos, soft drinks, peppers, salsa, and gas, as the recent opening of a department store across the street from his house has allowed him to increase his sales more.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken in Juan Carlos\u2019 business.

She is married and the mother of two children.  Her husband works as a taxi driver.  Her children are 12 and 15 years old and they are both in secondary school.  Bahrigul is a responsible and serious woman.  She raises young calves.  Her children help her after school.  Bahrigul has been involved in this activity for more than eight years and she currently has two bull-calves.\r\n\r\nBahrigul needs a loan to be able to pursue her activity.  With the requested amount of money, she wants to buy fodder, so that she can feed her calves during the cold winter months.  The money you will lend to Bahrigul will help her as well as her livestock.  In the future, she would like to increase her cattle headcount.  Bahrigul is confident that you will help her and she is looking forward to your

She is 37 years old and a hardworking woman. She has a beautiful family: she is married and the mother of four children (two daughters, ages 12 and 5, and two sons who are 14 and 10 years old).  Her children are all in school.  Khursand's husband is a rural laborer.  Khursand herself is involved in animal husbandry and, in her spare time, she also sews women's clothes.  She likes her work and she also helps her husband with his own work.  Animal husbandry is the family's main activity and main source of income. \r\n\r\nKhursand loves farms animals, and this is the reason why she has chosen to raise livestock.  She has been working in this field for more than two years now.  She essentially raises young calves, fattens them up and then resells them at the cattle market.  She is taking a loan to buy a few additional calves, so that she can increase her livestock headcount as well as the income that the family makes from animal husbandry.  The money you'll lend to Khursand will give her the opportunity to achieve her goals and will help create new economic opportunities for her family.  Please support Khursand!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1800628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a few head of cattle and increase her activity.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahrituz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-02-02T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-04T04:50:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khursand","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681399509},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696609585},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711525611},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:06:36Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731041380},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:05:28Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752130355}],"funded_date":"2015-02-23T00:32:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":835069,"name":"Luzviminda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luzviminda is 57 years old, married, and her family lives in Solana.

She grows farm crops on a leased land plot of 1 ha [2.5 acres] near her house. Khaticha started doing farming three years ago. She has planted onions on one half of her land and intends to plant potatoes on the other half. Khaticha is happy when she is able to produce a large harvest because the income from this business supports her family. Khaticha needs to buy quality potato seeds and mineral fertilizers in order to  have a high yield of crops. This is why Khaticha has applied for a loan to keep moving ahead. This loan will allow her to improve and expand her farming business.\r\n\r\nKhaticha lives with her family in the Qubadiyon region. She is married and has four children. Her children attend secondary school. Khaticha is hoping for your help and believes that, with your help, she will be able to finish planting and enjoy a large harvest next season.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":721.24,"image":{"id":1802088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy potato seeds and mineral fertilizers.

She is married and the mother of three children.  Her husband works in business and Firuza herself sews women's clothes.  She finds it very convenient to work from home as this activity allows her to take care of the household at the same time.  From the earnings that she gets from sewing, she has already saved some money to renovate her house, but she still doesn't have enough.
