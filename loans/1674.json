She grows farm crops on a leased land plot of 1 ha [2.5 acres] near her house. Khaticha started doing farming three years ago. She has planted onions on one half of her land and intends to plant potatoes on the other half. Khaticha is happy when she is able to produce a large harvest because the income from this business supports her family. Khaticha needs to buy quality potato seeds and mineral fertilizers in order to  have a high yield of crops. This is why Khaticha has applied for a loan to keep moving ahead. This loan will allow her to improve and expand her farming business.\r\n\r\nKhaticha lives with her family in the Qubadiyon region. She is married and has four children. Her children attend secondary school. Khaticha is hoping for your help and believes that, with your help, she will be able to finish planting and enjoy a large harvest next season.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":721.24,"image":{"id":1802088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy potato seeds and mineral fertilizers.

his family live in the Shahrituz district. He is only 36 years old. He is married and a father of two children. He has two younger brothers and two sisters. His brothers are not married and work in the Russian Federation because they could not find work in their native land, and did not have a choice other than leaving their relatives in order to support them.\r\n\r\nSidik could not leave. He stayed because he did not want to leave his family and hoped to find a good job. Sidik decided to start his own business, become a successful entrepreneur and plans to provide work for other residents, so that they would not have to go to distant lands for work. Sidik plans to start an animal husbandry business. He will buy several young calves, fatten them up for 30-35 days and, after fattening them up, sell them at a livestock market.

Fe knew that she has to get things right to yield more income for this cropping season. In the future, Fe hopes to buy a rice thresher to cater threshing jobs during the cropping season for additional income. She deeply wishes to provide her family with a better life and a good education for her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":243.75,"image":{"id":1807163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Her main sources of income have been eggs, milk, maize, and a variety of food crops that she plants. Taking care of her poultry is an activity she finds very enjoyable. Feeding her poultry is her hobby. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in the Kitale region. Agnes has good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market. However, the demand is so high. Being a visionary woman, Agnes has always wanted to increase her poultry. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Accessing financial services for women is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising women like Agnes will achieve their dreams and goals. Agnes believes that the key to increased egg production is proper feeding of poultry and taking good care of them. By ensuring that the poultry are fed well, she is guaranteed to reap the benefits. In addition to selling eggs and poultry meat, she will also sell poultry feathers that are commonly used to make earrings.

Kenya. Today, this humble mother sells milk, eggs, tea and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has of farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. <br \/><br \/>Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have a humble time milking and feeding her cow. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from getting diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain.

they were facing tough economic times. He is accompanied by his partner, and he makes a living carrying out home repairs. He has 6 children, four of whom are already of adult age and have their own homes. Only two of the children are still at home and study; they and his wife are dependent on Juan.\r\n\r\nJuan has been making a living in farming since he was small, and he would help his father with planting corn, beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, thick and standard chilli peppers. He also has a butterfly farm, because when he was little he used to watch how his grandfather took care of butterflies, and he would help him; this is how he learned. He doesn't have a set work schedule because he is busy all day.\r\n\r\nJuan needs the loan to buy a roll of wire to protect his crops, and to buy manure and fertilisers. \r\n\r\nDon Juan plans on improving his butterfly farm in the future, expanding it more in order to breed butterflies.

village of Kiamutugi in the Kerugoya area of Kenya. As a girl, she watched women in her village form small groups so that they could be financially stable. The memory of this collective effort led her to join the Ngariama self-help group. \r\n\r\nFor the past year, Salome has been actively involved in mixed farming. As she is from rural Kenya, gender roles still adhere and women do the heavy work of fetching and carrying water and wood, in addition to household chores, childcare and tending crops. Many are left to run farms alone while their husbands migrate in search of paid employment. \r\n\r\nThis has not been a setback because Salome has been making great profits in dairy farming. Kerugoya is one of the places with conditions that favor horticulture farming: good climate, soil, transport system, and market. Salome has always wanted to diversify and start horticultural farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is the lack of funds. She is therefore requesting a loan to start horticultural farming. \r\n\r\nThrough the Ngariama self-help group, whose members co-guarantee each other to secure a loan, Salome joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance organization that supports young and enterprising farmers. With this loan she intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers and potatoes. Proximity to an airstrip will allow her to transport the produce faster to an international market, enabling her to make more money. \r\n\r\nThis loan will improve Salome's living conditions and secure the future of her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1807226,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start horticultural farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-02T11:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-04T11:50:09Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.53,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salome","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":3433.84,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3540.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265069},{"amount":16.51,"local_amount":1467.44,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1513.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459697},{"amount":36.09,"local_amount":3232.8,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3333.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"payment_id":681378117},{"amount":35.75,"local_amount":3321.61,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3424.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.62,"payment_id":711506093},{"amount":94.49,"local_amount":8544.31,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:01Z","rounded_local_amount":8809.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.63,"payment_id":752111089}],"funded_date":"2015-02-02T23:49:18Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lavender","image":1304534}},{"id":834732,"name":"Martha Lilian","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha, elabora y vende quesadillas, su negocio tiene cinco a\u00f1os de existir, su producto es de calidad por lo que ha ganado popularidad y muchos clientes, ella es reconocida en la zona como una persona responsable y honesta, actualmente se encuentra soltera, tiene una hija que es enfermera y ejerce su profesi\u00f3n.\nComprar\u00e1 harina, leche, cuajada, levadura, etc., para elaborar las quesadillas que posteriormente vende, contara con la materia prima para continuar trabajando y satisfacer a sus clientes, pues ya cuenta con clientes potenciales, espera que la inversi\u00f3n le ayude a mejorar sus ingresos econ\u00f3micos.\nSus objetivos son mantener sus clientes satisfechos, seguir teniendo el esp\u00edritu de emprendedora para salir adelante y ayudar a otras personas a que puedan superarse.  \n","en":"Martha makes and sells quesadillas.

This is the sad story of Patrick, a youthful 41-year-old Mzee (old man), a wise farmer whose neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. He farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills near Litein, in the northern Rift Valley region of Kenya where he grows maize and keeps dairy animals. Patrick's farming experience dates back to 2000. Like many other farmers in the region, Tea is a cash crop which he has been planting for as long as he can remember. With time, the fertility of his land has started to dwindle and whenever he plants tea the yields go down with each growing season. Patrick has also been affected with weeds he recalls that at some point a strange but nice looking weed which produced purple flowers emerged and started to slowly colonize his farm causing his maize yields to decline even further. At some point he could not be assured of harvesting anything at all. Patrick's initial thought was that his farms had been bewitched, a notion that made him feel helpless. \r\n\r\nToday, Patrick requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy fertilizer, pesticides, and good quality seeds. Through this loan Patrick is going to increase his crop production and improve his income.

Meet Eunice, 44, a hardworking and honest farmer, who is based in the Litein area in Kenya. For the past ten years, she has been making a small living through practicing mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been selling milk and eggs to the nearby market. She also engages in a personal business, or \u201cside hustle\u201d as she likes to call it, to earn additional income. Eunice passionately loves dairy farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is accessing funds to increase her business. \r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, an organization that supports enterprising farmers, she acquired her first loan, which she used to buy an additional cow. She paid the loan back fully. She also benefited from training and the impact of the first loan cannot be underestimated. Eunice is seeking another loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. The cow she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 15-20 liters of milk a day. A liter of milk costs 50 KES; this means she will be making 11 USD a day. From this loan, the life of Eunice will permanently change and she will be able to secure the future of her school-going children. She will also assure her aging parents of a secure future. Eunice waits for your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":227.94,"image":{"id":1807362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-02T14:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-04T14:50:05Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.58,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2573.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2648.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2726.18},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2805.86},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2887.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2972.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3059.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3148.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3240.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3335.24},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3432.77},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3533.04},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3636.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.95},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.41},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.62},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.75},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":118.6,"local_amount":10542.44,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":10885.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459702},{"amount":104.76,"local_amount":9718.82,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":10035.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.58,"payment_id":711506096}],"funded_date":"2015-02-09T20:41:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":835178,"name":"Mashudi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mashudi is a married woman with three children, all of whom attend school.

He is a hard worker who always says, \u201cI eat from my sweat.\u201d He lives in Rongena, a rural village in the rich highlands of Litein. He is happily married and has been blessed with angelic looking children. He has farmed for five years, and has never regretted it. \r\n\r\nHis primary source of income has been milk, eggs, and crops. Most of the small-holder farmers in Rongena village own approximately \u00bc acre of land per household, and this has made them work extra hard to fully utilize their farms. He has been able to earn a decent and honest living by selling milk and eggs. These ventures have enabled him to send his children to school and feed his family. \r\n\r\nMartin has planted many trees on his compound and also has Napier grass, which has high protein and is used to feed his dairy cow. This enhances his milk-selling profits. Because of increased demand, Martin requests a loan to buy a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is a very profitable venture, and he wants to take full advantage of the ready market for dairy products. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Martin is sure of satisfying the demand for milk in his area. Through increased profits, Martin is sure that he will repay the loan on time and also be in a position to comfortably take care of his family. Martin, with his entrepreneurial spirit, strength and tenacity, would like to continue fighting so that he can achieve his dream of owning his own business and empowering society by being a source of employment. Juhudi Kilimo, through its training, has helped Martin save more effectively. He plans to add value to his milk through packaging. He also hopes to one day start manufacturing milk products such as yoghurt and cream.\r\n\r\nMartin will be able to continue farming and succeed with your

Meet Benard, 39, who is based in the Litein area of Kenya. This area may be the major 'bread basket' of the country, but it is increasingly emerging as an important dairy farming zone for East Africa. Thousands of farmers are now finding dairy farming a good supplement, if not a substitute, for maize. This handsome father has been practicing mixed farming for the past 14 years and his primary source of income has been milk and eggs. <br \/><br \/>Benard passionately loves dairy farming and he enjoys feeding his cow. Milking his cow is his hobby. Waking up every morning to milk his cow is very fulfilling to him. The biggest challenge he faces is the lack of a proper dairy unit where his cows can feed and rest. Because of this, he has suffered losses through diseases that attack his cows because of the harsh weather conditions. If you are to reap more from cows, you must feed them properly to get high quality milk. He is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to build a modern dairy unit. With the loan, he will be able to increase his milk production, improve his living conditions and secure the future of his school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":159.82,"image":{"id":1807460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to build a modern dairy unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-02T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-04T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.64,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.96,"local_amount":4968.35,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5320.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459706},{"amount":50.15,"local_amount":4355.15,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4663.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.66,"payment_id":696587798},{"amount":28.28,"local_amount":2478.94,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2654.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.64,"payment_id":731022915},{"amount":21.79,"local_amount":1904.47,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2031.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.34,"payment_id":752111095}],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T17:00:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":834752,"name":"Reyna Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Reyna, es madre soltera de un ni\u00f1o de un mes de nacido, se enfoca en trabajar para obtener los recursos econ\u00f3micos con los que puede costear sus gastos personales y cubrir todas las necesidades de su hijo, se dedica a vender ropa, cosm\u00e9ticos y joyer\u00eda de enchape, lo hace todos los d\u00edas y lo atiende ella sola, no representa dificultades para atender el negocio y cuidar de su hijo.\nComprar\u00e1 pulseras, aretes, cadenas, anillos, variedad de ropa y cosm\u00e9ticos, tendr\u00e1 un inventario al d\u00eda con las tendencias de la moda, de esta manera se le facilitara su venta e incremento en las ganancias, espera utilizar correctamente el cr\u00e9dito para tener efectos positivos. \nLos sue\u00f1os de Reyna son cancelar sus deudas y que su negocio sea autosostenible. \n","en":"Reyna is a single mother with a one-month old son.

By doing this, she can help her family members gain access to sanitation, promote their health, and help to lessen environmental deterioration. She is thankful for the loan granted through HKL with a much lower interest rate than other general loan products.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":405,"image":{"id":1807271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Meet Edwin, 30, who is based in the Litein area of Kenya. This area is the major tea growing region of the country, but it is increasingly emerging as an important dairy farming zone for the East Africa. Thousands of farmers are now finding dairy farming a good supplement, if not a substitute, for maize farming. \r\n\r\nThis handsome father has been practicing mixed farming for the past 14 years, and his primary source of income has been milk and eggs. He passionately loves dairy farming. He enjoys feeding his cows, and milking his cow is his hobby. Waking up every morning to milk his cow is very fulfilling to him. \r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge he faces is the lack of a proper dairy unit where his cows can feed and rest. Because of this, he has suffered losses through diseases that attack his cows due to the harsh weather conditions. If you are to reap more from cows, you must feed them properly to get high quality milk. He is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to build a modern dairy unit. With the loan, he will be able to increase his milk production, improve his living conditions, and secure the future of his school-going children.\r\n\r\nThanks to the support from Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders, he will be able to build this business and become independent\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1807507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buld a modern dairy unit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-02T16:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-04T16:40:04Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3244.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3339.18},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3436.76},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3537.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3640.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3746.97},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3856.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3969.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4085.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4204.57},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4327.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4453.92},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4584.09},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4718.09},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4855.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.3},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.68},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.57},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":834759,"name":"Noemy Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nohemy, estudi\u00f3 hasta cuarto grado de b\u00e1sica, est\u00e1 casada y su esposo trabaja con ganado, en la agricultura y en la alba\u00f1iler\u00eda, tiene 4 hijos, pero solo una hija vive con ella.\n\nNohemy, vende ropa en los cantones vecinos, solo tiene un mes de hacerlo y lo aprendio por iniciativa propia para tener un ingreso economico y entretenerse en una actividad productiva; anteriormente vendia en el mercado.\n\nElla, ocupa el cr\u00e9dito para comprar ropa para vender, con esto ella mejorara mucho su negocio, porque con el prestamo podra comprar al por mayor, para ofrecerles a los clientes mejores precios.\n\nSus sue\u00f1os son, aprender bien el negocio para poder darle un mejor futuro a su hija.","en":"Nohemy studied until the fourth year of her basic education.

Meet Winrose, 41 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Tegecha, a remote village in Litein. She is happily married and is blessed with adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained a great deal of experience.\r\n\r\nTo afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Litein area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry.\r\n\r\nBeing a woman seeking to access funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved and that she will be able to buy more poultry. As a result of the loan, she will sell more eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level.\r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry market to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, permanently change her living conditions, and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":147.82,"image":{"id":1807503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-02T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-04T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.58,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Winrose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5,"local_amount":444.13,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":458.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265072},{"amount":31.9,"local_amount":2835.33,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2927.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601244},{"amount":34.82,"local_amount":3114.72,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3216.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.22,"payment_id":681378123},{"amount":19.35,"local_amount":1742.13,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1798.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.25,"payment_id":696587801},{"amount":36.26,"local_amount":3295.01,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3402.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.81,"payment_id":731022918},{"amount":18.91,"local_amount":1707.84,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1763.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.3,"payment_id":752111097}],"funded_date":"2015-02-02T18:00:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":834761,"name":"Gilma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gracias al cr\u00e9dito brindado do\u00f1a Gilma compro los diferentes insumos agr\u00edcolas que fueron utilizados para dar a sus cultivos de caf\u00e9 el debido y adecuado mantenimiento evitando gracias a los foliares, abonos y dem\u00e1s comprados que su cosecha de caf\u00e9 se perdiera o fuera afectada por alguna plaga como el ojo de gallo, la roya o que se hubiera deteriorado por el factor clima.

She started pursuing her passion in the year 2000. She is a hardworking and honest farmer who is based in Magena, a remote village in the Kenyenya area of Kenya. For the past six years, she has been making a small living through practicing mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been selling milk and eggs to the nearby market. She also engages in a personal business or \u201cside hustle\u201d as she likes to call it, to earn additional income. Sarah passionately loves dairy farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is accessing funds to increase her business. Through Juhudi Kilimo, an organization that supports enterprising farmers, she acquired her first loan, which she used to buy an additional cow. She paid the loan back fully. She also benefited from training and the impact of the first loan cannot be underestimated. Sarah is seeking another loan from Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva lenders, to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. The cow she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 15-20 liters of milk a day.

The seven ladies of the group are in great necessity for funding since there is no other way that they can secure a loan to sustain or expand their small businesses, send their children to school, and support their families. Many of the women weave and embroider colorful cloth and must purchase thread and yarn as well as other supplies. Their textiles are unique tapestries of flowers, birds and geometric figures.\r\n\r\nMaria is a 30-year-old member of the \u201cFlores de Panimache\u201d who has had only three years of formal education. She has two children. Maria wants to invest her loan in her \u201ctortilleria\u201d or tortilla shop where fresh tortillas are made three times each day. She will use her portion of the group loan to purchase large quantities of corn, lime, and cooking gas. Her business is ideally located in Guatemala City, the busy capital of the country. Maria is quite happy to have her business because it is profitable and she is able to employ two young women to meet the demands of her clientele. She has short-term plans to open another locale.\r\n\r\nThe members of \u201cFlores de Panimache\u201d are quite enthusiastic about the educational component of their monthly meetings. A Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares knowledge with the women about a variety of subjects ranging from effective business practices to nutrition and hygiene as well as women\u2019s rights and self-esteem. The organization calls the combination of education and small loans \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d and it has had a huge positive impact on the women.

mother. She is just 23 years old. She lives in the Qubadiyon district. Nigora is a beautiful, kind and hardworking woman. She has a secondary education. After graduating from school, she got married and began her new life. Nigora started crop farming two years ago. She runs the household and does a good job managing her work. Nigora is now readying the soil for sowing seeds. Nigora needs to buy mineral fertilizers, wheat seeds and potato seeds. As she does not enough money to buy seeds and mineral fertilizers, Nigora applied for a loan. This loan will help her sow her seeds and not be without an income for the entire season. Crop farming is like air for her - without this business, she is unable to breathe. She loves crop farming because the income from this business provides for her family. You can now support Nigora.

In addition, she is very sincere.  She is 48 years old with a family of seven children, but only four of them are their parents' responsibility now.  They live in the community of Solol\u00e1.\r\nMargarita (she is the one in the middle of the photograph) is a person who is very committed to her family.  Twenty years ago, she looked for an activity to generate economic income.  The activity she chose was making traditional clothing and other things related to the clothing line.\r\nIt is a business that years ago was not common, but now many people make a living with this activity.  Because of all the years she has been working, Margarita has customers.  In order to maintain this business, Margarita needs a loan which will help her buy thread which she can use to make blouses, fabric bracelets, and buy beads because she also makes finished blouses for other communities.\r\nMargarita is requesting this loan along with other women, since Margarita wants other women to progress as she has regardless of the activity they engage in.  She tells them that it is important for women to generate their income because only in this way that they will they be able to reach their goals.  The dream of the group now is to get the loan so that they can assist their children to become professionals and it is easier and faster for a group to get credit because they don't request as many guarantees.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":593.67,"image":{"id":1806644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy basic materials (threads).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T03:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T03:10:12Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matilde ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":5500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":458.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.64,"local_amount":460.02,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":464.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624777137},{"amount":60.29,"local_amount":457.39,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":461.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636134452},{"amount":44.21,"local_amount":335.36,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:07:40Z","rounded_local_amount":338.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649489556},{"amount":77.66,"local_amount":589.15,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":594.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664971985},{"amount":60.11,"local_amount":456.02,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":460.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681267519},{"amount":159.68,"local_amount":1211.33,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1222.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696477417},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":330.47,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":333.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711384997},{"amount":43.77,"local_amount":332.06,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":335.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731215117},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":331.91,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":334.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752000635}],"funded_date":"2015-02-08T14:01:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Livingston Sutro","image":null}},{"id":835392,"name":"Carmencita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmencita is 54 years old and married with five children, two of whom are in school.

She gets a lot of help and support running her business from her handsome husband and their lovely children. \r\n\r\nIn a bid to expand her farm, Linah is seeking a KES 30,000 loan to purchase farm inputs, farm implements and animal feed. Currently, she sells sheep meat (mutton), wool, and crops at Yemit . \r\n\r\nTo boost the quantity of produce she sells, she needs a loan from Kiva lenders to purchase farm inputs such as seeds and fertilizer.

Meet Willimina, 29 years old, who is from Litein, a remote rural town in the South Rift area of Kenya. This is a region with good weather patterns that favor crop and animal farming. She resides with her handsome husband and they are blessed with beautiful children. Willimina has been actively involved in mixed farming for the past 10 years and she sells milk, eggs, and various varieties of food crops at a local market and to her neighbors. Litein is one of the places with conditions that favor horticulture farming: good climate, soils, a transport system, and market. \r\n\r\nWillimina has always wanted to diversify and start horticultural farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is a lack of funds. She is therefore requesting a loan to start horticultural farming. Through the Tuiyobet self-help group, whose members co-guarantee each other to secure a loan, Willimina joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance organization that supports young and enterprising farmers. With your loan, she intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers and potatoes. Proximity to an airstrip will allow her to transport the produce faster to an international market, hence enabling her to make more money. This loan will improve Willimina's living conditions and secure the future of her children"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":302.28,"image":{"id":1807830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T09:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T09:40:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.41,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Willimina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2580.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2655.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2813.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2895.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2980.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3067.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3157},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3249.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3344.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3441.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3542.55},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3646.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3752.63},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3862.31},{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3975.18},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4091.36},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4210.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.51},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.85},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.02},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.45},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.72},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.03},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.04,"local_amount":6492.67,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6704.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265073},{"amount":63.76,"local_amount":5667.12,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":5851.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459710},{"amount":61.14,"local_amount":5506.77,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5686.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.81,"payment_id":696587802},{"amount":101.93,"local_amount":9202.78,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":9502.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.6,"payment_id":752111098}],"funded_date":"2015-02-20T15:14:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":835447,"name":"Salma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salma is 28 years old and an active borrower of BRAC Pakistan.

the horticultural market. She is the mother of a beautiful family and has been doing crop farming too, but for subsistence purposes. She also grows vegetables, a bit of maize and grass for her cow. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to grow vegetables on a bigger scale for commercial gains. The demand for horticultural products such as fruits and vegetables has grown steadily in Kenya in recent years. As much as they have become one of the top traded agricultural products, there is still plenty of room to expand. \r\n\r\nLeah is very excited to start commercialization of her crops. With your $25 loan, you can help her achieve this.

Meet Dinah, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Nandihills area of Kenya, near the famous Rift valley escarpment of Kenya. \r\n\r\nDinah, 39, has been farming for the past 5 years. Through these years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, maize, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Dinah is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Nandihills area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Dinah could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Dinah, but she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Dinah believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable a permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Dinah to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children. All that Dinah waits for is your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":292.14,"image":{"id":1807889,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cereals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T14:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T14:40:04Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.68,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.85,"local_amount":6742.56,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6962.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265076},{"amount":62.67,"local_amount":5570.37,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5751.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459714},{"amount":75.98,"local_amount":6842.36,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7065.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1,"payment_id":696587805},{"amount":74.96,"local_amount":6812.71,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":7034.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.68,"payment_id":731022922}],"funded_date":"2015-02-22T15:11:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":835475,"name":"Geraldine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geraldine is 25 years old and a married woman with three children.

Meet Flora, an ever smiling 38-year-old, very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Chepkoiyo, a remote village in Nandihills. \r\n\r\nShe is happily married and is blessed with four adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business or \u201cside hustle\u201d as she likes to put it. \r\n\r\nThe Nandihills area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d \r\n\r\nFlora's biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to expand her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 35,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. For a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profits and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":259.93,"image":{"id":1807926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T15:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T15:20:06Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.32,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2477.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2549.45},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2623.95},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2700.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2779.57},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2860.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2944.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.45},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3119.02},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3210.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3303.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3400.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.99},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.47,"local_amount":5903.95,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6193.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265078},{"amount":60.71,"local_amount":5311.83,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5571.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459716},{"amount":62.78,"local_amount":5566.05,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5838.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.83,"payment_id":696587806},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":5962.45,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":6254.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.49,"payment_id":731022923}],"funded_date":"2015-02-20T03:17:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":835490,"name":"Emmanuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emmanuel is a Ugandan, married and a hardworking man.

In the past eight years, she has bred more than four dairy cows, developed her farm, and planted and sold a variety of crops. Lenah says the secret to her success is thinking of farming as a way to make money, not just as a traditional way of life \u2013 adopting new technologies and methods, crop diversification, record-keeping and good planning also helps. Lenah was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming. \r\n\r\nLenah always says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming; it runs in my blood.\u201d Because of how much she likes farming she has even nicknamed one of her cows \u201cChemunken.\u201d She is a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. Through her dairy cow, she is able to get between 10-15 liters of milk a day, and this helps her support her family. Lenah also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements.\r\n\r\nLenah is requesting a loan to buy farm implements. She will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer, and pesticide that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques and using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and increased profits. Lenah is visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production and be able to get more harvest than the previous year. All this can be achieved through lender help and goodwill. Lenah believes that her loan will help turn around her family\u2019s life and she will be able to give her child a solid educational background. This loan will be Lenah\u2019s way out of poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":564.68,"image":{"id":1807913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farm implements, high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T15:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T15:20:06Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.06,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lenah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.12,"local_amount":5965.86,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6160.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265077},{"amount":55.66,"local_amount":4947.23,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5108.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601245},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2581.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459715},{"amount":145.99,"local_amount":13059.88,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":13485.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.93,"payment_id":681378125},{"amount":108.98,"local_amount":10109.88,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":10439.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.76,"payment_id":711506104},{"amount":150.74,"local_amount":13609.71,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":14053.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.37,"payment_id":752111100}],"funded_date":"2015-02-10T06:18:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":835470,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter is a 34-year-old married man living in Kagadi, Uganda with one child.
