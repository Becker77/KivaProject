food for her family. Six years down the line, Rose is deep into commercial dairy and crop farming. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea and vegetables. The money she makes from her various investments have helped elevate the quality of life led by her children who are in school. Rose is seeking a loan to purchase dairy goats and expand her crop farm. The crops she grows on her farm are insufficient to fulfill the demand. However, to grow more crops, she needs more land, more farm inputs, more equipment and more labor. Crops aside, the other concern Rose is dealing with is the shift in preference in the dairy industry. Goat milk demand is on a steady rise in Kenya. As more people in Kenya are favoring goat milk because of its nutritional value, cattle farmers are being forced to start adopting dairy goat farming. Caught up in this situation, Rose will find your loan very handy. With KES 30,000, she will be able to purchase a couple of dairy goats to start with. She is also going to pay for the resources necessary to expand her crop production. She has made a commitment to herself that the money she will make from this investment will go to loan repayment and her children's education. The money will also offset some of the farm expenses. She is certain that your lending will have a very big impact on her life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":228.17,"image":{"id":1807978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To pay for dairy goats and expand her horticultural farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T17:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T17:00:10Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.05,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":5000.37,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5354.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265080},{"amount":53.08,"local_amount":4549.31,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4871.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459717},{"amount":55.84,"local_amount":4848.78,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5192.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.73,"payment_id":696587807},{"amount":58.86,"local_amount":5158.67,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5523.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.32,"payment_id":731022925}],"funded_date":"2015-02-03T19:49:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":835510,"name":"Cypriano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cypriano is a 36-year-old, hard-working married man living in Kamwenge, Uganda.

To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Kerugoya area is very populated and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. \r\n\r\nShe lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 15,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry.\r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan, permanently changing her living conditions, and securing the future of her school-going children.\r\n\r\nSupport an entrepreneur with innovative ideas who is searching for a way to support her parents, and her children's studies.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":121.25,"image":{"id":1808021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T17:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T17:00:10Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.21,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1061.59},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1092.62},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1124.55},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1157.42},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1191.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1226.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1261.89},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1298.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1336.72},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1375.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1416},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1457.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.9},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.72},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.6},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.33,"local_amount":1485.39,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1589.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265082},{"amount":18.7,"local_amount":1602.58,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1714.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601248},{"amount":12.08,"local_amount":1035.83,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1108.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459718},{"amount":13.94,"local_amount":1203.33,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1287.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.1,"payment_id":681378128},{"amount":14.54,"local_amount":1264.43,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1353.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.21,"payment_id":696587809},{"amount":28.54,"local_amount":2502.55,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2677.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.66,"payment_id":731022927},{"amount":14.91,"local_amount":1298.63,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1389.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.24,"payment_id":752111103}],"funded_date":"2015-02-04T05:55:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":835514,"name":"Damazo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Damazo is a hard-working married man with four children living in Kamwenge, Uganda.

Now it\u2019s time for us to introduce you to one of our Ruma agents, Sofyan. Sofyan lives in Cimulang, Bogor, West Java. He lives there with his wife and his two daughters. He already has been with Ruma for a year. He feels happy because ever since he joined Ruma, he can improve his business and save more money for another business opportunity.\r\n\r\nAt the first time, Sofyan was only selling mobile airtime credits to his customers, but now, he is adding one more product from Ruma called \u2018Mapan\u2019. \u2018Mapan\u2019 is a new product from Ruma, an e-commerce for lower communities. By providing Mapan to his customers, Sofyan will be able to receive orders from customers who want to buy products that have been listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer orders, Sofyan will simply send an SMS in a format to the SMS center and then the customer will pay him. After it, Ruma\u2019s agent will come to his stall to collect the money and within 3-5 days, the product will be delivered right to the customer's door.\r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Sofyan needs to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to process more mobile airtime credits. Sofyan\u2019s track record in the past time in selling mobile airtime credits has been quite impressive because of the high demand from the customers toward the mobile phone airtime credits itself. Having known about the importance, your loan will be very useful to help Sofyan improve his business and accordingly, help his community, who needs access to such services. \r\n\r\nAs seen in the photo, Sofyan is the one who is standing in his own small stall - holding a Ruma poster. He will be very thankful for your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1808004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to provide more mobile services in his community","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bogor Barat","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T17:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T17:00:18Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sofyan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":10000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":10000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-25T19:18:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":835538,"name":"Alaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alaa is a 28-year-old single man who works as a chef in a restaurant to cover his needs and expenses.

James is a hardworking, ambitious, and go-getter farmer who is 57 years of age. He hails from Kiamugunda, a small village in the Kerugoya area of Kenya. He comes from a very humble background; he did not manage to attend college, but that did not kill his spirit to succeed.\r\n\r\nHe has actively been involved in farming for the past 10 years. Although he has made great strides in farming, he wants to diversify his farming and is kindly seeking a loan to buy pigs. Pig farming is one of the profitable agricultural ventures in Kenya and James, having an entrepreneur's mind, wants to take advantage of that to improve his living conditions. James loves pig farming because pigs are not demanding to keep, unlike poultry, which require special care and attention. James believes that with the loan his life will permanently change because he will be selling pork meat to a ready and available market. As far as the market of pig products is concerned, demand is greater than supply. James always says, \u201cTo become a successful pig farmer you need three ingredients and that is getting the right breed, giving the right feed, and proper care.\" \r\n\r\nWith the loan he believes he will become a successful pig farmer and will be able to realize his dream of transforming his life. Having farmed for the past 10 years, James finds it very enjoyable to raise pigs because he does not spend more money on buying food. Pigs feed on remains that can be collected from hotels and restaurants and hence save a lot of money. James will also sell manure from the pigs and use it on his farm, also saving much more money and improving his living conditions. Profits from selling pig meat to the local market and to the industry that produces sausages and bacon will be used to fully repay the loan. Your support of this go-getting farmer could give him an enormous push. With what he earns, he will repay the loan and pay for the studies of his children and siblings.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1808107,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T17:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T17:20:06Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4300.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4426.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4555.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4689.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4826.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4967.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5112.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5261.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5415.43},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5573.7},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5736.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5904.24},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6076.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6254.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6437.17},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6625.34},{"due_date":"2016-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6818.92},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7018.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.57},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.95},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.8},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.81},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.01},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Kuperberg","image":null}},{"id":835558,"name":"Siranush","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Siranush is 56 years old and she lives in the city of Vedi, which is in the Ararat region.

living in a rural area. He is married and has 2 dependent children. Kobiljon is involved in farming and grows cereal crops. Farming is the sole source of income for his family. In the winter, during the off season for farmers, he goes to Russia for work. He works there on private constructions as a hired worker. Kobiljon's wife also goes to the field to help her husband with his work. Together, they try to provide everything necessary for their children, give them a decent education and help with their beginnings. At the present time, he is building a house, but cannot finish it due to temporary financial difficulties. Kobiljon decided to request support from Arvand and hopes to receive it.

Meet Caroline, a very hardworking, energetic young farmer. Although she has only farmed for the past 16 years, she is working hard and learning good farming practices. With the profits she makes, she has been able to take care of her family and provide for the basic needs of her parents. \r\n\r\nCaroline lives in the Kuserwo, Kapsowar, area of Kenya. The area has generally good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming. Maize is a very common crop in Kenya and is a staple food for many, who regularly eat \u201cUgali\u201c (hard porridge) cooked from maize. One can usually buy sifted maize flour in the market, but its cost is higher because of the processing. Flour can be less expensive, however, if it is milled directly using a posho mill. \r\n\r\nThe Kuserwo area has only one, diesel posho mill that is operated by Caroline and it serves a great number of people. The main problem here is that the posho mill keeps breaking down. Caroline intends to change this by buying new spare parts to permanently change this situation .She seeks a loan to repair her posho mill.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that through the loan the breakdowns will be few and far between. \r\n\r\nProfits derived from the mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan. Caroline sees herself established and running more than one posho mill, within the next two years. She patiently waits for your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1808126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She started pursuing her passion in the year 2008. She is a hardworking and honest farmer who is based in Gikui, a remote village in the Nkubu area of Kenya. She is a proud mother of three lovely children.\r\n\r\nFor the past six years she has been making a small living by practicing mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been selling milk and eggs to the nearby market. She also engages in a personal business or \u201cside hustle,\u201d as she likes to call it, to earn additional income.\r\n\r\nDoreen passionately loves dairy farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is accessing capital to grow her business. Through Juhudi Kilimo, an organization that supports enterprising farmers, she acquired her first loan, and she used it to buy an additional cow. She paid the loan back fully. She also benefited from training, and the impact of the first loan must not be underestimated.\r\n\r\nNow Doreen is seeking another loan from Juhudi Kilimo, and Kiva lenders, to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. The animal she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow capable of producing between 15 and 20 liters of milk per day. A liter of milk costs 50 KES; this means the cow will be making 11 USD worth of milk per day.\r\n\r\nFrom this loan, the life of Doreen will permanently change, and she will be able to secure the future of her school-going children. She will also assure her aging parents of a secure future. Doreen waits for your kindness. Her farm will be maintained and go from strength to strength, with your help!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":311.83,"image":{"id":1808248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T18:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T18:00:20Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.9,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doreen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":41600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2944.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3118.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3209.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.71},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3400.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3499.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3601.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3707.18},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3815.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3927.02},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4041.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.19,"local_amount":7023.39,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":7355.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265089},{"amount":73.02,"local_amount":6394.95,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":6697.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459724},{"amount":76.71,"local_amount":6811.53,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":7133.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.07,"payment_id":696587814},{"amount":79.01,"local_amount":7080.13,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":7414.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.83,"payment_id":731022933}],"funded_date":"2015-02-04T03:59:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":835610,"name":"Kyempara Women Group 1","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faith is 50 years old, a hard-working married woman, with eight children, a member of the Kyempara Women Group 1.

Meet Jane. She lives in the Kerugoya area of Kenya, renowned for producing long distance elite runners who have broken world records in the Olympics.\r\n\r\nJane is a loving mother and has been in the agricultural business for 14 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and vegetables. Jane has been relying on agriculture to make all of her income. However, rising costs of farming inputs, such as fertilizers, and fluctuations in market prices are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. Despite these tough conditions, Jane remains positive and passionate about her economic activity.\r\n\r\nJane is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of her business least affected by harsh external conditions. A poultry farm is cheaper to run, and the demand for chicken products is always high.

Ciciliah wants to take full advantage of poultry farming as a profitable business venture. She would like to expand her poultry business, but the biggest challenge she faces is lack of capital. She is requesting a loan for 20,000 KES, which she will use to buy additional poultry. With the loan, Ciciliah will be able to expand the poultry section on her farm. This will generate enough income to repay the loan and allow her to save extra money.

Meet Caroline, a farmer from a remote village in Cheptuiyet in the Kericho area of Kenya. She resides with her handsome husband, with whom she is blessed with a lovely family. \r\n\r\nCaroline has been actively involved in farming for the past 12 years and has never regretted it or looked back. She practices mixed farming and sells milk, eggs, and various food crops at the local market. She passionately loves poultry farming, but the biggest challenge she is facing is a lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and which lay more eggs. \r\n\r\nCaroline is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. She will use the excess maize she has to feed her poultry, and she will feed them sorghum to give them energy and green grams for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate into more income. Apart from an increase in egg output, Caroline will increase her output of poultry meat, and this will also increase her income and profit margins. \r\n\r\nWith increased profits, she is going to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. In addition to better profits, Caroline is going to benefit from chicken manure, which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer. She will then save more money by not having to buy fertilizer. Your loan will bring joy to this family because Caroline will be able to support her family and improve their living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":161.95,"image":{"id":1808272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T19:00:35Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T19:00:35Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.03,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.32,"local_amount":2427.04,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459726},{"amount":22.75,"local_amount":1963.59,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2101.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.16,"payment_id":681378133},{"amount":16.13,"local_amount":1401.57,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1499.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.22,"payment_id":696587815},{"amount":25.21,"local_amount":2256.82,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2414.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.12,"payment_id":711506112},{"amount":66.51,"local_amount":5832.27,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":6240.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.53,"payment_id":731022934}],"funded_date":"2015-02-14T01:16:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":835637,"name":"Yoneda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yoneda is a 36-year-old female.

Teresina also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Teresina's Group will be able to receive a total of 11 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 6.25 acres.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1807910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T19:00:43Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T19:00:43Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeremiah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David M.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Idd M","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kassim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph K","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ismael M","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fridah K","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nanzala K.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Metrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":120190,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120190}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-22T12:43:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Clover van Steenberghe","image":1359957}},{"id":831453,"name":"Luc\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLucia es una mujer casada de 36 a\u00f1os, tiene una bonita familia de 5 hijos todos ellos est\u00e1n estudiando en una escuelita de su comunidad, ellos viven en una comunidad de Solol\u00e1. \nLuc\u00eda es una mujer que apoya a su familia para que tengan lo necesario, pues para la generaci\u00f3n de sus ingresos, ella trabaja en la agricultura, sembrando papa, arveja, zanahoria entre otras verduras, Luc\u00eda a pesar de que no tuvo la oportunidad de asistir en la escuela, pues ella a trav\u00e9s de sus conocimientos adquirido con sus padres, puede sobrevivir,  y con esto ella ayuda a su esposo en las aspiraciones para la prosperidad de su familia.

She has five years of experience in farming.<br \/><br \/>Mercy is seeking a loan to expand her horticultural farm. She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output. Loans for smallholder farmers with little, irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations, like Juhudi Kilimo, support farmers like Mercy. Through a group of 15 members called Njoe Gikuru, Mercy has access to loans from Juhudi Kilimo. They use the group-based savings as collateral. According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Mercy, because the institution believes that women, too, are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175.39,"image":{"id":1808242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to expand her horticultural farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T19:40:26Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T19:40:26Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.26,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.61,"local_amount":2454.47,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2532.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265088},{"amount":15.96,"local_amount":1418.86,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1464.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601252},{"amount":17.55,"local_amount":1560.12,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1609.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459723},{"amount":18.06,"local_amount":1616.86,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1668.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.13,"payment_id":681378132},{"amount":17.29,"local_amount":1558.47,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1608.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.24,"payment_id":696587813},{"amount":18.32,"local_amount":1700.38,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1754.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.81,"payment_id":711506110},{"amount":17.63,"local_amount":1603.5,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1654.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.41,"payment_id":731022932},{"amount":40.71,"local_amount":3678.18,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3795.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.67,"payment_id":752111107}],"funded_date":"2015-02-04T11:26:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":835629,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello world! Meet Joyce. Joyce, 37, is a very dedicated mother who believes in hard work. She is happily married and blessed with three lovely children, whom she often refers to as \u201cmy pride.\u201d \r\n\r\nJoyce is based in Nkubu, a small remote rural town in Kenya that has bad terrain and is characterized by drought and bad weather conditions. For the past ten years, she has been actively involved in mixed farming. Her primary source of income is from milk and crop farming. Joyce passionately loves dairy farming and has nicknamed one of her cows. Milking her cow is her hobby and feeding her cows makes her very proud. Dairy farming is very fulfilling for Joyce. \r\n\r\nAlthough this humble mom makes a living through selling milk, she faces the challenge of irrigating her farm and providing water to her animals. Nkubu is a remote area without piped water or electricity. Since Joyce is from a marginalized community, she is forced to walk long distances to search for water. She typically walks for two hours. Therefore, Joyce is requesting a loan to buy a water tank. Most of the rain water in her area goes to waste, and Joyce wants to harvest the water and store it in a water tank. \r\n\r\nThe loan will save Joyce time and allow her to irrigate her farm during dry seasons and increase her productivity. The increase in productivity will translate into more income, which will provide Joyce with financial security. Joyce will also use the stored water for home consumption. Joyce's dream is to increase her farming activities and provide her children with a proper education. Education is the only way that her children, who are from a marginalized community, can succeed."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":143.98,"image":{"id":1808277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a water tank in order to harvest rain water for use.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T19:40:26Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T19:40:26Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.38,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.77,"local_amount":3090.81,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3189.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265090},{"amount":34.25,"local_amount":3044.65,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3141.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459727},{"amount":35.55,"local_amount":3204.4,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3306.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.5,"payment_id":696587816},{"amount":38.03,"local_amount":3458.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3568.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.88,"payment_id":731022935}],"funded_date":"2015-02-03T22:15:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":835645,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane is a 44-year-old married woman with five children, four of whom are attending school.

The place where she works is about thirty minutes away and she walks there. \n\nShe is applying for a loan to pay workers, buy fertilizer, manure, plant fertilizers, and other products which she needs to care for and maintain her coffee crops in order to have a wonderful harvest. She hopes to sell the harvest to generate a financial income and improve her household finances.

Geoffrey, from Litein, a remote town in Kenya, is an active and progressive farmer in his locality. He has a wife and together they live on a small piece of land. \r\n\r\nTraditionally, his primary source of income has been eggs, crops, a personal business, and he has been practicing farming for the past 13 years. Having done farming for such a long time he has gained so much experience that he is always ranked the best farmer in his village. \r\n\r\nKenyans drink a lot of milk. This tradition is probably derived from tribal culture - particularly the Maasai tribe (Geoffrey\u2019s tribe) - where cows represent wealth. Demand for dairy milk has been high and Geoffrey wants to take advantage of the market. Therefore, he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is another profitable agricultural venture in Kenya and Geoffrey has already identified the breed of dairy cow that he wants. \r\n\r\nGeoffrey always says that, \u201cTo become a successful dairy farmer, one does not need to be a livestock expert.  All one needs is passion, information, and keenness to learn from the successful farmers.\u201d He has planted so many trees on his farm that food for the cattle will never be a problem. Marketing of the dairy milk and dairy products will not be a challenge, because he will sell the milk directly to the market and also to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Geoffrey will not only benefit from milk, but will also benefit from manure (cow dung) that will be used in improving the fertility of his farm, thus saving money that would have been spent buying fertilizer. Geoffrey has been facing challenges in accessing finances, but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, are there to make his dream come true. Geoffrey chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low and is on a reducing basis. \r\n\r\nGeoffrey underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and during the training season he learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. Through accumulated profits Geoffrey plans to permanently improve his living conditions, and to secure the future of his school-aged children by paying tuition fees for them. He plans that through increased income, he will be able to buy more dairy cows and build a bio-gas digester, and hence save costs incurred in buying fuel."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":517.85,"image":{"id":1806203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He is very excited about this addition since now he will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.\r\n\r\nUsing this loan, Danston's Group will purchase a total of 11 solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 3.75 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1747450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light, hybrid seeds and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T23:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T23:10:08Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Danston","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Musa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luke","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aggrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice S","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephat A","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peres","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":83070,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83070}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cheryl Strecker","image":1412668}},{"id":832389,"name":"Regina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Regina is 68 years old and has 8 children.

Miranga B village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from the communal water point . This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Emmaculate and her family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nEmmaculate works as a business owner, but has also volunteered her time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables her community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Emmaculate and 2 other promoters in her community, Paul and Milka, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Emmaculate will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Emmaculate wants to be a promoter because she believes that the dispenser program will help reduce water-borne diseases by treating their water, thus improving the health of those in the community. She also says that when using chlorine children under 5 years old will be healthier.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Emmaculate\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1804672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To support an innovative water treatment technology using chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmaculate ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milka ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1350,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-10T04:49:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":834636,"name":"Melisa's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melisa is a 37-year-old proud mother of 8 children.

County, Kenya. Otigo village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from Konyango spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Margaret and her family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nMargaret works as a subsistence farmer, but has also volunteered her time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables her community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Margaret and another promoter in her community, Susan, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Margaret will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Margaret wants to be a promoter because she believes that the chlorine will help to prevent water-borne diseases. \n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Margaret\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1804709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"Toprovide her community with access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2015-02-03T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-05T23:30:03Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-04T21:37:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":833988,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah is 30 years old, and a single mother from Mundri, South Sudan.

The group sells its crop at a fair price to Empresa de Comercializa\u00e7\u00e3o Agricola Lda (ECA), a local agribusiness which both acts as a buyer and provides the farmers with quality farming inputs and technical advice. An investment by AgDevCo has allowed ECA to purchase a state-of-the-art maize mill, designed for use in rural areas, so it can process the farmers\u2019 crop before selling it on. The group in total farms 14.5 hectares of land. All farming is done manually. The farmers require finance to purchase vital farming inputs - all of them purchase seed and some choose to also purchase fertilizer. \n\nAccess to a group loan of 26,060 Meticais (776 USD) equates to an average of 1,861 Meticais (55 USD) per participant- enough for the farmers to purchase from ECA the inputs they need. Farming conditions in the area are extremely tough with only intermittent rainfall. However, since becoming participants on the Chozvo scheme all the farmers report life becoming easier. They can afford good quality fertilizer, which is purchased from ECA. The farmers\u2019 crops are also bought by ECA every week - they come to their farms so the participants do not need to walk long distances to find a market for their crops. Since ECA\u2019s arrival into their community, and with access to funds to purchase the necessary inputs, the farmers have seen their yields and incomes increasing threefold. This is allowing them to invest in their farms, buy motorbikes and send their children to school.

The group sells its crop at a fair price to Empresa de Comercializa\u00e7\u00e3o Agricola Lda (ECA), a local agribusiness which both acts as a buyer and provides the farmers with quality farming inputs and technical advice. An investment by AgDevCo has allowed ECA to purchase a state-of-the-art maize mill, designed for use in rural areas, so it can process the farmers\u2019 crop before selling it on. The group in total farms 11.5 hectares of land. All farming is done manually. The farmers require finance to purchase vital farming inputs - all of them purchase seed and some choose to also purchase fertilizer. \n\nAccess to a group loan of 28,250 Meticais (841 USD) equates to an average of 1,883 Meticais (56 USD) per participant- enough for the farmers to purchase from ECA the inputs they need. Farming conditions in the area are extremely tough with only intermittent rainfall. However, since becoming participants on the Chozvo scheme all the farmers report life becoming easier. They can afford good quality fertilizer, which is purchased from ECA. The farmers\u2019 crops are also bought by ECA every week - they come to their farms so the participants do not need to walk long distances to find a market for their crops. Since ECA\u2019s arrival into their community, and with access to funds to purchase the necessary inputs, the farmers have seen their yields and incomes increasing threefold. This is allowing them to invest in their farms, buy motorbikes and send their children to school.

The community of Kuberetu B village collects their drinking water from a local well because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Kuberetu B\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser program offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. Kuberetu B community will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. John has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their drinking water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are 4 other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Penina, Mwita, Seline and Eunice.\n\nKuberetu B community needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser.

Benard is a friendly member of the community with 4 children. Benard lives with his family in a house made of mud walls, dirt floor, and an iron roof.\n\nNyabola A village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from the communal water point. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Benard\u2019s family and the 10 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nBenard has volunteered to be the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Benard volunteered to be the promoter because he wants to help the community to access safe water, thus improving the health of his community by reducing water-borne illnesses. There are also two other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: that is Dinah and Carolyne.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits.

Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Silvia\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1805497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To provide her community with free access to chlorine to treat drinking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2015-02-04T00:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-06T00:50:13Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-07T22:36:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":835287,"name":"Pablo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nPablo es un se\u00f1or casado de 36 a\u00f1os, \u00e9l tiene una hermosa  familia de 3 hijos, ellos estudian en una escuelita de la comunidad, esta familia vive en una comunidad de Concepci\u00f3n. \n\nPablo es un hombre que se dedica  duro al trabajado  cada d\u00eda, para generar su econom\u00eda, la actividad que realiza Pablo es la compra y venta de verduras, eligi\u00f3 esta actividad ya que en el lugar donde vive, es una zona totalmente agr\u00edcola y en toda la \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o se consigue verdura, de esta manera pablo ha logrado alcanzar sus metas y objetivos  con su familia. \nPues Pablo para seguir con esta actividad necesita contar con suficiente  capital de trabajo,  y es por eso que \u00e9l solicita un prestamo que le servir\u00e1 para comprar cebollas por cuerda, esta actividad es  muy  ventajoso por que se compra ya la verdura solo para cosechar  o sea no se hace todo el trabajo que lleva.

Denny owns a stall selling mobile airtime credits and small snacks. His wife helps him to get more income by being an insurance agent and selling women's fashion like clothes and accessories. Both of their children go to school. As the business runs, he needs to get a working capital loan from Kiva that will be used to process more mobile airtime credits. Your loan will help him very much to improve his business. As seen in the photo, Denny is sitting in front of his stall. He will be very thankful for your support.

He is 35 years old and they live in a community in Solola.\r\n\r\nPaulino learned farming as a child. He makes a living growing vegetables such as potatoes, carrots and other products. Most of his produce he sells in the market in his community and some of it he sells to customers who come to where he works. To gain more income and profits from his crops, he involves his children during the planting and harvest season so that they can help him and he can avoid paying wages to other workers.\r\n\r\nPaulino has no other income.

Gulhan. She grows farm crops in her region, where she owns a land plot. She has been in this line of work for over two years and enjoys it. Every season she harvests a large quantity of crops. This is the result of her hard work: she does all she can to produce a bountiful harvest.  For this she needs to cultivate her sol properly and buy quality seeds.

Justine works as a subsistence farmer for a living. Her community of Kome B village does not have access to clean water. The water that is used for drinking and cooking is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases. Justine is a friendly member of the community, and has been elected Promoter by her village to help its members obtain safe drinking water.\n\nAs a volunteer Promoter, Justine represents the community on Kiva\u2019s website and educates the community on how to protect their families from unsafe drinking water by using a chlorine dispenser system. Justine and four other promoters in her community need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Justine wants to be a promoter because she believes that the dispenser program will help to prevent  water-borne diseases. \n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Justine\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1805349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To support an innovative water treatment technology - chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2015-02-04T05:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-06T05:40:03Z","loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dickens ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evans ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-14T04:27:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":835840,"name":"Marilou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilou is 45 years old, married and has five children.

The city is known for its beautiful beaches, which are frequently visited all year long, its gastronomy, and for being a place of unequaled beauty with many tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nThis is where Mar\u00eda, 22, lives.  She has a common-law husband and is six months pregnant with her first child.  Her husband is a merchant.\r\n\r\nWith the help of a loan, Mar\u00eda and her husband rented a shop in the city center not too long ago where they sell phones, accessories, recharges and spare parts.  Her husband is a technician and does consulting work regarding all types of cell phones.  Despite the fact that they have been in business for a short time, sales are very high since they purchase directly from wholesale suppliers.

Melva has been doing this work for nine years, allowing her to move forward in life.\r\n\r\nMelva will use this loan to buy clothes, shoes, cosmetics, and other items to sell. Melva has been with the loan group since its creation but likes it because of the help through loans. Melva\u2019s dreams are to continue moving forward and keep up her good health."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1807712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes, shoes, cosmetics, and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2015-02-04T08:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-06T08:50:17Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melva Carmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1062.31,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":132.79},{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":132.79},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":132.79},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":132.79},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":132.79},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":132.79},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":132.79},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":132.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":268.76,"local_amount":265.58,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":268.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624232585},{"amount":268.76,"local_amount":265.58,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:42:33Z","rounded_local_amount":268.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636218328},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":265.58,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":268.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649569974},{"amount":268.73,"local_amount":265.57,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":268.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665050510}],"funded_date":"2015-02-04T11:58:04Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:20:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":835848,"name":"Rosalinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalinda works hard to support her family.

Now it\u2019s time for us to introduce you to one of our Ruma agents, Linda. Linda lives in a suburban area named Cibereum, located in Bogor, West Java. She lives there with her husband and her two daughters. She owns a stall where she sells daily consumer products, small snacks and mobile airtime credits, She also processes utility bill payment in her stalls. Linda\u2019s husband works as a teacher. To help her husband improve their life, she decided to join Ruma four months ago. She feels happy because ever since she joined Ruma, she has been able to improve her business and save more money for another business opportunity. She also feels as well that Ruma sales executives are really kind and really helpful.\r\n\r\nAlthough she just joined Ruma four month ago, her track record in selling mobile airtime credits sales has been quite impressive because of the high demand from the customers for the mobile phone airtime credits, especially on the weekends. As the business grows, Linda needs to get a working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to process more mobile airtime credits.

Now it\u2019s time for us to introduce you to one of our Ruma members, Zaenuddin. Zaenuddin lives in West Bogor, West Java. He lives there with his wife and his children. He joined Ruma a year ago. He feels happy because ever since he joined Ruma, he can improve his business, save more money for another business opportunity and he can give access to his community that needs the services.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, Zaenuddin was only selling mobile airtime credits to his customers, but now, he is adding one more product of Ruma called \u2018Mapan\u2019. Mapan is a new product from Ruma, an e-commerce product for communities. By selling Mapan to his customers, Zaenuddin will be able to receive orders from customers who want to buy products that have been listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer places an order, Zaenuddin will simply send an SMS in a format to the SMS center and then the customer will pay him. After that, Ruma\u2019s agent will come to his stall to collect the money, and within 3-5 days, the product will be delivered right to customer's door.\r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Zaenuddin needs to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to process more mobile airtime credits. Having known about the importance of this, your loan will be very useful in helping Zaenuddin improve his business and accordingly, his community, that needs access to such services. As seen in the photo, Zaenuddin is the one who is sitting in his small stall. He is very thankful for your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1808729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to provide more mobile services in his community.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bogor Barat","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-02-04T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-06T16:10:05Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaenuddin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":12000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":12000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-28T09:38:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":835911,"name":"Bezhan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bezhan is 63 years old.

She raises cattle and has given five years of her live to this business. She is good at raising livestock. She buys cattle, fattens them for 30-40 days, and then resells them at the local market. She likes doing this because she determines her own income. Maysara applied for a loan because she has small number of livestock and wants to continue her business. This loan will help her not to lose a source of income.\r\n\r\nMaysara is married and has five children: three sons, ages 3, 5 and 19, and two daughters, ages 16 and 17. Her husband is a construction worker and her oldest son helps his father with his work. In their spare time, Maysara's husband and son help her with her work.

Meet Andrew, who is 32 years of age, a hard worker, and a very honest farmer. He hails from the Siongiroi area of Kenya, an area that has good rainfall patterns and is known for dairy farming. Andrew has three children whom he adores and cherishes and a beautiful wife who always paints a smile on his face. \r\n\r\nHe has been practicing mixed farming for the past six years and is making great strides. He has been able to earn a decent and honest living through milk and egg-selling and personal business. These ventures have enabled him to send his children to school and feed his family. \r\n\r\nAndrew has planted many trees on his compound and also has Napier grass, which has high protein and is used to feed his dairy cow, thereby enhancing his milk-selling profits. \r\n\r\nBecause of increased demand, Andrew is kindly requesting a loan to buy a good-quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is a very profitable venture and he wants to take full advantage of the ready market for dairy products. With the loan, Andrew is sure of satisfying the demand for milk in his area.
