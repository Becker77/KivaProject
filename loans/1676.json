He is a progressive, smallholder, mixed-farmer in Kenya. He comes from the luxuriant, white highlands of Kericho, an area known for tea production and dairy farming. Alfred owns a fertile, two-acre piece of land in this lush region of Kenya. On the land, he keeps dairy cattle, and grows maize and tea. He gets a lot of support from his dear wife. \r\n\r\nBeing a father of a large family comes with lots of responsibility and feeding this large family requires a lot of hard work, so Alfred has to put in extra efforts to comfortably take care of his family. Alfred started farming just after finishing high school. Since he never advanced his education, and because of the high unemployment rate, he ventured into farming.  He has never regretted this because of the profits he has been making. Alfred practices mixed farming and is regarded as one of the hardworking farmers in his village, because he is able to juggle between keeping dairy cows and also doing crop farming. \r\n\r\nAlfred is a visionary and enterprising person, and has always wanted to do dairy farming in large scale, but one of the challenges he has faced is lack of enough capital. That is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy a dairy cow. Through the loan Alfred is confident that his life will be transformed, and his dream of providing a secure future for his children will be achieved. Alfred is relieved to know that his life can be secured through partners such as Kiva lenders, who help small scale and aspiring men such as him. Your help will be very important, because people from such remote villages have very limited support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":271.24,"image":{"id":1808830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-04T17:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-06T17:40:07Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.31,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3680.14},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3787.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3898.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4012.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4129.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4250.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4374.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4502.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4633.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4769.39},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4908.78},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5052.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.73,"local_amount":8295.62,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":8413.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459732},{"amount":82.69,"local_amount":7581.92,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":7689.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.15,"payment_id":696587823},{"amount":93.51,"local_amount":8651.6,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:53Z","rounded_local_amount":8774.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.16,"payment_id":731022941}],"funded_date":"2015-03-05T05:48:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":835957,"name":"Corazon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Corazon is a hardworking entrepreneur with 3 children.

He will also use the money to buy pesticide to ensure that his crops are not attacked by bugs predominating the farms in the area. Income from this venture will help Jamleck repay the loan, take care of his wife, and take his children to school. Jamleck's family will be very grateful to Kiva lenders for their kind hearts, to spare their needs and help Jamleck raise money to move his family forward.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":298.03,"image":{"id":1808850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase potatoes, beans, and pesticide for his horticulture farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-04T17:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-06T17:40:07Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jamleck","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.52,"local_amount":3068.69,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3153.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265093},{"amount":17.16,"local_amount":1524.93,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1567.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601259},{"amount":127.37,"local_amount":11448.14,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":11765.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.42,"payment_id":681378140},{"amount":42.91,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4110.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.09,"payment_id":711506118},{"amount":70.63,"local_amount":6449.82,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":6628.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.93,"payment_id":731022942}],"funded_date":"2015-03-06T17:28:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":835956,"name":"Myline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myline is 26 years old, married, and has one child.

Meet Anna, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman who hails from Nandi Hills area of Kenya, an area that is near the famous Rift valley. She is 46 years of age and has been farming for the past eight years. Through those years, she has gathered so much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming and her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, tea, crops and some small businesses that she does so that she can make ends meet. Anna is very passionate about farming and she loves cultivating her farm. That is why every day she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. \r\n\r\nAlthough Anna makes profits through farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income through the selling of cereals. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy cereals. The Nandi Hills area is one of the regions that is populated and has a high demand for cereals. That means that Anna will make more profits and be able to satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Anna, but she feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Anna believes that this loan will be of much help and she will be able to satisfy the demand that is there for cereals.  She believes that the extra income will allow permanent change to her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Anna to repay the loan, and secure the future of her school going children. Lenders, if there is someone you should invest in, then it is Anna.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":197.18,"image":{"id":1808878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase cereals to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-04T18:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-06T18:00:10Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.58,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1821.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1874.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1929},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1985.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2043.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2103.15},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2164.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2227.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2292.98},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2359.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2428.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.62},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.13},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.61,"local_amount":1964.21,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265094},{"amount":40.95,"local_amount":3722.71,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3740.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601260},{"amount":42.52,"local_amount":3908.36,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3927.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.47,"payment_id":681378141},{"amount":39.74,"local_amount":3711.73,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3729.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.09,"payment_id":731022943},{"amount":49.78,"local_amount":4618.13,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4640.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.02,"payment_id":752111112}],"funded_date":"2015-02-10T00:05:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":835975,"name":"Rabah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rabah is a 27-year-old, married man.

For this reason, she hopes that her sales will increase in the coming days, and so she is applying to FUSAI for a loan to invest in chickens, hens, food concentrate, and vitamins and in this way to have a good quantity of products to offer her customers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":401.91,"image":{"id":1793941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to invest in chickens, hens, food concentrate, and vitamins.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2015-02-04T18:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-06T18:20:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jennifer Lisseth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":35.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":36.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":37.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":39.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40.58},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":42.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":47.02},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":48.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.7},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.78},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.79,"local_amount":68.79,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-26T09:33:22Z","rounded_local_amount":68.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":626300489},{"amount":36.34,"local_amount":36.34,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":36.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636148388},{"amount":37.7,"local_amount":37.7,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:27:20Z","rounded_local_amount":37.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649503292},{"amount":39.12,"local_amount":39.12,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:32:47Z","rounded_local_amount":39.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664984914},{"amount":40.58,"local_amount":40.58,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":40.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681279569},{"amount":42.1,"local_amount":42.1,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:32:39Z","rounded_local_amount":42.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696488931},{"amount":43.07,"local_amount":43.07,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":43.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711398559},{"amount":46.25,"local_amount":46.25,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:34:49Z","rounded_local_amount":46.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730919845},{"amount":47.96,"local_amount":47.96,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":47.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752010678}],"funded_date":"2015-02-10T04:19:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":835948,"name":"Donabella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Donabella is a 59-year-old married woman and a sari-sari store owner residing in Leyte, Philippines.

Her primary sources of income are from selling eggs, milk and crops and from some personal business she does to make ends meet. Bridget loves farming and has even nicknamed her cow. She really takes good care of her dairy cows. The Kitale area has favorable conditions for horticultural farming, which is good soil, climate and a transport system as well as an existing market for horticulture products. Bridget wants to take advantage of these conditions and start horticultural farming. She is seeking a loan to start this new enterprise. Through an increased income, she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children. The financial benefits that Bridget will reap will be almost immediate; hence she will be assured a secure future.

She is a farmer whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Siongiroi in the Rift valley region of Kenya. For the past 15 years, she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been growing maize, cabbages, and tomatoes. She also keeps dairy cows and sells milk. Bornes has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. \r\n\r\nBornes mobilized other women in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a micro finance institution that assists aspiring women. She requested a loan from Juhudi Kilimo, which she will use to buy another motorbike. Bornes is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge, hence she suffers many losses. Perishable products such as milk and vegetables require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price. With this loan Bornes is going to achieve her dream and goals. \r\n\r\nAccessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Bornes feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo  that help women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical, because Bornes will never suffer losses due to delays in delivery of produce to the marke. She will also increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market, hence increased income level. Bornes is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work. With this loan, Bornes will improve her living conditions and assure her children and grandchildren to come of a secure future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":409.99,"image":{"id":1808938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a motorbike to transport produce to the market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-04T19:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-06T19:00:04Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.65,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bornes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4730.89},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4869.15},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5011.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5157.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5308.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5463.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5623.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5787.82},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5956.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6131.06},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6310.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6494.66},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6684.47},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6879.82},{"due_date":"2016-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7080.89},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7287.82},{"due_date":"2016-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7500.89},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7720.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.68},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.34},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.28},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.27},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.44},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.62},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.86},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.16},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.53},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.46,"local_amount":8392.27,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":8537.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459734},{"amount":32.29,"local_amount":2931.53,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2982.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.36,"payment_id":681378144},{"amount":17.47,"local_amount":1596.4,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1624.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.31,"payment_id":696587825},{"amount":131.23,"local_amount":12357.44,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:43Z","rounded_local_amount":12571.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.39,"payment_id":711506121},{"amount":125.89,"local_amount":11536.7,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":11736.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.59,"payment_id":752111115}],"funded_date":"2015-02-22T18:03:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":836007,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello, world!

He's been a farmer his whole life, and tends to crops and cattle. He inherited this profession from his parents, so he gained much experience just by being born into it. He has a small portion of land where he grows onions, carrots, and other vegetables. He sows and harvests twice a year and usually gets a good harvest. \n\nNow he  is going to grow other kinds of vegetables and offer them to local people, but his situation is very difficult. He needs to plant fruits and care for them, but the lack of water in the region is a problem for him.

She uses a sewing machine and other stitching machines as well as handstitching hems and linings.<br \/><br \/>One of the main dilemmas of employees like Maria Hazel is meeting family expenses without access to savings or credit. Workers can become heavily indebted to money lenders who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. <br \/><br \/>For this reason Maria Hazel is asking for your assistance to help her circumvent loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem in repaying them since the loan payments were automatically deducted from her paycheck. She is seeking a 12,000 PHP loan to pay for the tuition of her child who is already in college.<br \/><br \/>Maria Hazel hopes that her two children will be able to finish their studies and find jobs with the right fit later on. She looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. <br \/><br \/>CCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force and equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.<br \/><br \/>CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers such as Maria Hazel before starting their daily work routine.

She set out to take loans from money lenders but to her surprise the interest rates were too high and she returned back without taking the loan because if she took the loan, she wouldn\u2019t be able to repay it along with the interest. \n\nWhile she was in her tea stall, a friend of her came and told her about WSDS providing loans with low interest rates. She hurriedly applied for the loan with a hope of a bright future by buying more items for her tea stall so that she could expand her tea stall and earns more income than before so as to manage her family household expenses. She is grateful to the funders and the organization for their work. She almost gave up on her hopes but WSDS makes her stay put on her hope once again. She wishes the organization best of the best and says, \u2018Long live WSDS\u2019.\n\nThe rest of the members of the group are needing, and have therefore requested, loans to start their respective business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1803084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase ingredients like milk powder, edible oil, wheat flour, tea leaves, bread to expand her  tea stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2015-02-04T19:20:30Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-06T19:20:30Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nengboi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneiting","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingliankim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Momoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimhoihching","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T18:25:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":833542,"name":"Nato","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nato, who is a 45-year-old married woman, lives in the village of Kldistskaro.

Her business is buying and selling clothes together with her husband Edward. She started as a sales lady in the mall in clothing area and her husband\u2019s a sales boy in a buy and sells clothes. In 2003, they decided to have their own business using their own savings in a stall her older sister gave her. She started with selling shirts for men and women and eventually added clothes for children and dresses for teens.  \n\nIrine bought readymade dresses mostly coming from Hong Kong and Thailand, which are the same practice with the other clothing stores. However, income is not consistent because of its seasonal nature. Prices of readymade dresses goes up during certain months.  So, she came up with the idea of buying yards of fabric, designing and asking a dressmaker to sew clothes because it is cheaper compared to buying readymade clothes to sell but the problem is she doesn\u2019t have the capital.\n\nWith the help of a friend in January 2014 she joined SEED programs and even attended a skills training. Her first loan in the amount of PhP 8, 000 brought her idea into reality. She bought different yards of fabrics (cotton, denim, corduroy, linen) and had those made in her own design (from dress, to crop pants, long sleeves and skirts). She sells it to her store in much lower price and it became popular with the costumer.  Much more to her surprise she now has a costumer buying in bulk of her design clothes gaining her a net of PhP 5,000 daily. Her second loan of PhP 10, 000 she added to buy more fabrics to accommodate her new costumers.\n\nWith the loan her business improved. She has now more costumer buying bulks of her clothes. She has increased her savings for their children and bought a new refrigerator. Still she needed help in to maintain her growing business. \nNow she asks for a loan amounting to PhP 27,000 to buys yards of fabric of cashmeres, silks, polyesters, and for the initial rental advance to a second stall in addition to her current clothing stall.  She still continues to attend SEED\u2019s trainings to help her improve her knowledge on business. She also saves enough for the education of her children.

is 58 years old and separated for 25 years. She has 2 children all grown up and they live with her together with their families. \n\nBeing a High School graduate and has limited employment options, she started vending when her husband stopped supporting them financially.  Her first business was selling groceries using a cart on the street near the market. However, government does not allow vendors on streets and are considered as illegal. Thus, from time to time Elizabeth faces difficulty in selling her goods and experiences her items being confiscated by the police. This prompted Elizabeth to save in view of a plan of setting up a store where security and stability of business is not anymore a concern. \n\nWhen she saved enough money, she started a mini grocery store just in front of her house using PhP 3,000 as starting capital. She bought packs of snack foods, candies, noodles, biscuits, coffee, laundry soaps and bath soaps and from those gained a net income of PhP 500 \u2013 750 daily. She saved half of the money and spent half for her children\u2019s needs. When she saved enough she decided to expand her small grocery into a wholesaler grocery store, gaining her an income of PhP 3,000-4,000 daily and a net of PhP 5,000-6000 weekly.\n\nShe came to know SEED from a member who is also one of her regular customers. She invited Elizabeth to attend an orientation about SEED programs. She now asks for a loan amounting to PhP 50,000 to buy her 3 sack of sugar, 5 sacks rice, soft drinks, and oil in addition to her own stocks which are demanded by her costumers. \n\nHer store helps support their family even now that her daughter and son are both living with her with their families. Her store also helps in supporting her 2 granddaughter\u2019s education since their parents have limited capacity of financing their children. Her children were not able to finish school due to poverty and owing to the fact that before her business was only able to support their family\u2019s most basic needs. This time, Elizabeth wants to turn the table and ensure that her grandchildren will be able to finish their education. The wholesale store is still their family\u2019s main source of income. However, Elizabeth and her family stands a better chance of earning with potential support for their business coming from micro finance institutions such as SEED.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1802931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Job

is 37 years old, a housewife with 5 children of which the eldest is 19 and the youngest is 10 years old. \n\nTo earn their keep, Agnes set up a general store with her husband helping her in operations. Her husband used to be an overseas worker, but got sick and needed to go back home. It was providential that Agnes was able to save when her husband was still working. With the PhP 20,000 she saved, Agnes invested in a general store.  \n\nInitially she sold noodles, coffees and biscuits, sugars, cooking oil, canned goods, laundry soaps, candies and soft drinks.  Seeing that there are too many other general stores in their community, Agnes thought that she will gain more and help other micro-entrepreneurs in her community if she can upgrade her store to do wholesaling.\n\nWith hard work and continuous savings, Agnes slowly expanded her store until she was able to wholesale additional commodities such as eggs, condiments and toiletries. With these items now on wholesale, their store became popular to their neighbors.  Agnes also  claims that she is able to have more customers now in as much as smaller stores in her community need not go to the City market do buy goods anymore.  She is able to earn a net of PhP 4, 000-5,000 a day. However, most of her costumers are asking her to sell rice since it\u2019s a staple Filipino food item. Unfortunately she doesn't have the capital to invest into wholesale rice vending.\n\nIn December 2014 she learned about SEED through a friend who is also a member of the organization. She joined the orientation, business and training programs and she like it because of its low interest rate and social services. \nAgnes is requesting for a loan amounting to PhP 50,000 to buy an initial 25 sacks of rice for wholesaling and materials for the construction of rice storage. With this investment Agnes is confident of increasing more her income and also in being able to help other smaller stores in her community.\n\nIn the future she also plans on building a piggery in their province, since her mother used to have one before. But more than that, she wanted to save for the future of her children, especially with their education. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1802925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Job Creation"],"use":"To buy an initial 25 sacks of rice and for the construction of rice storage in her wholesale store ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tondo, Manila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":389,"posted_date":"2015-02-04T19:20:31Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-06T19:20:31Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":239.6,"local_amount":10416.65,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":10541.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624384501},{"amount":239.6,"local_amount":10416.65,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":10541.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636453884},{"amount":191.68,"local_amount":8333.32,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":8433.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649722696},{"amount":191.65,"local_amount":8333.32,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:14:12Z","rounded_local_amount":8433.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665212906},{"amount":287.47,"local_amount":12500.06,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T16:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":12650.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681573188}],"funded_date":"2015-02-06T11:02:56Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T16:39:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":832963,"name":"Humaira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Humaira is 28 years of age.

She completed primary school, but due to financial problems, she didn't continue studying.  She is in a relationship, but her domestic partner works abroad in the U.S.  From this relationship, she has two children, the older of whom is in his third year of school and the younger in kindergarten.<br \/><br \/>She has been working in this field for approximately 5 years, having learned how to plant and grow guavas from her parents, with her brother and a brother-in-law helping to maintain the crop.<br \/><br \/>For extra income, she also works in dressmaking, which she does in the house where she lives.

She has a very big family. She is 53 years old. She is married and a mother of four children. Her husband is retired. She has three sons and one daughter. The older sons work at a mobile phone company. The younger son and daughter attend a university.\r\n\r\nMunavar has been involved in sewing women's clothing for 7 years.

Nkubu area of Kenya, an area that is near the famous Mount Kenya (the second highest in Africa). She is 55 years of age and has been farming for the past eight years. Through those years, she has gathered so much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, tea, crops and some small businesses that she does so that she can make ends meet. \r\n\r\nCecilia is very passionate about farming, and she loves cultivating her farm. That is why every day she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. Although Cecilia makes a profit through farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income through the selling of cereals. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy cereals. \r\n\r\nThe Nkubu area is one of the regions that is populated and has a high demand for cereals. That means that Cecilia will make more profit and be able to satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Cecilia, but she feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. \r\n\r\nCecilia believes that this loan will be of much help and she will be able to satisfy the demand that is there for cereals. She believes that the extra income will allow a permanent change to her life, and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Cecilia to repay back the loan and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225.69,"image":{"id":1809012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase cereals ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-04T20:20:40Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-06T20:20:40Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.6,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.83,"local_amount":4699.58,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5008.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265096},{"amount":54.14,"local_amount":4640.99,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4946.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459736},{"amount":55.89,"local_amount":4877.39,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":5198.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.01,"payment_id":696587828},{"amount":58.23,"local_amount":5127.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5464.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.59,"payment_id":731022948}],"funded_date":"2015-02-14T18:54:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":834954,"name":"Manuel Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La industria del entretenimiento es amplia y su consumo es masivo.

This was a result of financing from Thrive, trainings on business management and the support she got from her group members in the form of ideas, encouragement and savings. Her business is growing well and she is looking forward to improve her stocking quantities as she is now faced with higher demand for her products. This is largely due to the fact that it is proving less affordable for the public to buy school uniforms from renowned school uniform suppliers.

He is dedicated in full to his work. This man only thinks about going forward and delivering good produce. He knows that many people consume his farm products, and because of this, he makes sure his products are pure and of good quality. He is a 28-year-old farmer from Chemalul village, situated in the Rift valley province of Kenya. He lives with his wife and children on a small piece of land where he keeps cows and grows a wide variety of crops. For 10 years, his primary sources of income have been milk and produce. His biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals, to prevent these diseases. Christopher made a decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help him improve his farming activities. Sometime this month, he applied for a loan to expand his farm. This will enable him to expand his operations to increase the overall output. The additional income from the expansion will go to his children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is increasingly becoming prohibitive to low-income communities, especially in the rural areas. As a result, kids are forced to drop out to start working to contribute their earnings to their families. With your loan, Christopher's children will acquire quality education that will act as a strong foundation for their bright future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":209.12,"image":{"id":1809122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To expand his horticulture farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-04T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-06T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.9,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":103.64,"local_amount":9212.13,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":9467.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459737},{"amount":100.58,"local_amount":9376.1,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:43Z","rounded_local_amount":9635.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.9,"payment_id":711506124}],"funded_date":"2015-03-06T22:00:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":836075,"name":"Albert's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Albert is a 65-year-old proud father of five children.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to invest in a business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Albert\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 7.5 acres of land and purchase a total of 12 solar lights.\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1800802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-02-04T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-06T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Festus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses S","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luka M","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noah M","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David C","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jethro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ezakiel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susy W","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":136060,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136060}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":836063,"name":"Merinciana's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merinciana's Group is made up of 12 farmers in Teso District in Kenya.

He has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2014 and decided to represent his group because he wanted to help more farmers. He says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that he has learned a lot from farming trainings. Idi plans to use the profits from this coming season to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nIn total, Idi\u2019s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 4.75 acres of land.

In the Philippines the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal.

She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an Php 11,000 loan.

She works hard each day and she is pretty sure that she is closer to reaching her goals.\r\n\r\nMa. Morena owns a variety store. She believes that business is her stepping stone to making this happen. She knows how important it is for her neighbors and daily consumers to have a nearby store where they can buy a sachet of shampoo, a bar of soap, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, an egg, toothpaste or even an ice cube. She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price then she will sell them at a higher price to have a profit.\r\n\r\nShe desires to manage a bigger store someday so she is requesting an Php 11,000 loan which she will use to buy additional groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She is positive that she will become a successful businesswoman in the future and and she looks forward to seeing her children finish their studies through all her hard work and perseverance.\r\n\r\nMa. Morena meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

at 26 years of age, due to the lack of opportunities for employment and economic need, is motivated to become independent and earn an income on his own. For this reason, he started farming 5 years ago. Richard is a passionate smallholder farmer based in Chemase village in the Nandihills area of Kenya. For the last five years he has been practicing mixed farming to support his family and siblings. Richard makes money selling milk and a variety of food crops, such as maize, from his farm. Richard is seeking a loan because he wants to get into the poultry business. This is a diversification from dairy and crop farming. \r\nHe enjoys dairy farming as much as he does crop farming. However, the region usually experiences long dry spells which inevitably affects crop harvests negatively. For this reason, Richard is seeking a loan to buy poultry. Poultry will serve both subsistence and commercial purposes. There is a high demand for poultry products in the developing town of Nandihills, which is the nearest town to Richard's village. Proceeds from the sale of eggs will help Richard cope with the rising farm expenses that is putting many farmers in the region out of business. \r\nHis long-term plan is to free his family from the chains of poverty. For Richard, this support will be very important, since it will be the first loan that he has gotten in his 26 years.

The above picture is of Rosemary, a hardworking, honest, and dedicated farmer. She is based in Siongiroi, a remote town with harsh living conditions because of the bad terrain in the region. She is happily married, and together with her husband, has a lovely family. Her primary sources of income are milk and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. Rosemary is a tough woman with tough skin and she has managed to take care of her family with her income from milk selling. \r\n\r\nThe Siongiroi area has conditions that favor dairy farming and Rosemary has always wanted to take care of another dairy cow, but the lack of capital has prevented her. She is seeking a loan to buy an additional dairy cow. The dairy cow she intends to buy is not just an ordinary cow; it\u2019s a breed that produces between 10-20 liters of milk a day. With this cow, she will produce more milk, which will translate into more income. Demand for milk in the Siongiroi area is high but the supply is low.

","en":"Burmabu is 63 and a widow with three children. She has a higher education and works in animal husbandry and agriculture as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began 14 years ago. Thanks to her hard work, purposefulness and determination, she currently has three hectares of her own land where she grows beans, as well as three cows. Her monthly income is about 10,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nSince this amount of income is insufficient to cover her living expenses, Burmabu has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 KGS to purchase a cow to increase her number of livestock.

Her son studied very hard and passed with very good grades to realize his mother's dream which is for him to enter the university and continue his studies.\r\n\r\nThe family`s income can't cover the family expenditures in addition to the university fees for Moayad and his siblings, So Moayad decided to work and study at the same time.\r\n\r\nAlthough Moayad is working, he could not cover the university fees because of the increasing cost of living. Therefore Sameera applied for an education loan to pay for her son`s university fees, to help him graduate and find a better job to help his family with household expenses.

She is 75 years old and lives with four grandchildren. Ana is in the process of converting her coffee crops from conventional to organic. She has so far paid for the conversion with her own funds, but would like to enhance the process by purchasing two cows, which would produce the raw material for solid organic fertilizer, as well as a pulper. This investment will enable Ana to improve coffee quality and production, and will require 5,000,000 pesos. Her medium- and long-term goals are to increase her production to 3000 kg of dried parchment coffee and to plant 6800 coffee plants. \r\n\r\nIn terms of family, Ana would like to make improvements to her house and help her grandchildren so that they may continue to study subjects related to coffee production. The conversion of production of organic coffee is a comprehensive, independent, wholesome, balanced, and environmentally-friendly long-term process. It poses a challenge for Colombia's farmers.

He is a smallholder farmer from Kaplamai village in the North Rift region of Kenya. Like most farmers in the region, Stanley practices mixed farming. He keeps dairy animals and grows maize among other crops. He has been doing this work for a decade now. Over the years, he has come to like farming because it is a sustainable and self-fulfilling investment. \r\n\r\nFarming doesn\u2019t take all his time, so he is also able to attend to his side business of carrying passengers in his motorbike(boda boda). A delicate balance of both jobs has enabled him to comfortably raise his four children. Stanley is seeking a loan to purchase poultry and construct a chicken coop. He is ready to get into commercial production for meat, eggs and, perhaps, feathers. This business is very profitable but it doesn\u2019t require a license, a big space or product marketing. There is an established market for poultry products in almost all places around the world. Besides, chickens will bring many non-monetary benefits to Stanley\u2019s farm. Chickens will be great for his farm's compost because their poop is high in nitrogen; in free-range, they will naturally forage by scratching soil looking for bugs, which aerates the soil and breaks up vegetation for decomposition. \r\n\r\nStanley will also use your money to construct a chicken coop in order to make the raising of chickens easier.
