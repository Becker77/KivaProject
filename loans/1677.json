She is humble and hard-working, with the drive and perseverance that distinguishes the men and women that work the field. She is a woman with an entrepreneurial mindset. Born in 1957, Emily has grown into a strong and independent woman. She is a mixed farmer, who grows maize and vegetables for both consumption and sale.\r\n\r\nEmily is seeking a loan, with which she intends to purchase a high-quality dairy cow. The dairy business is very profitable in this area. Most families rely on milk to feed their children and prepare their meals. Ugali is the staple food of people from Litein area of Kenya. Ugali is tasteless, as it is made from pure maize flour and water. To make this into a mouthwatering delicacy, it has to be accompanied by sour milk and well-cooked vegetables, and meat for those who can afford it. Milk is also an ingredient in the preparation of vegetables. The heavy reliance on milk allows dairy farmers to do well in this region. Milk prices are always high because of the high demand. Little product marketing is required here, because milk is milk. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Emily will not only reduce the amount of money she must spend on milk for the family, but also she will increase her income from the sale of milk. She will use the profits to expand the business and to keep supporting her family. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":340.63,"image":{"id":1809678,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a high-quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-05T19:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-07T19:20:17Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.37,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3244.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3339.18},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3436.76},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3537.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3640.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3746.97},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3856.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3969.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4085.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4204.57},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4327.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4453.98},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4584.09},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4718.06},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4855.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.3},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.68},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.57},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.03,"local_amount":8091.83,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":8339.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265101},{"amount":77.7,"local_amount":6906.95,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":7118.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459746},{"amount":78.68,"local_amount":7099.75,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":7317.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.19,"payment_id":696587835},{"amount":89.85,"local_amount":8180.11,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":8430.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.18,"payment_id":731022957}],"funded_date":"2015-02-19T23:40:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iris Belen","image":697625}},{"id":836397,"name":"Rosabelle","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosabelle is 40 years old and married with seven children.

Currently Gulbairakan has four cows, three calves and ten sheep on her farm. She grows sweet corn on a plot of land of 0.50 hectares. \r\n\r\nGulbairakan's monthly income is 7,000 som (KGS). This sum is unfortunately not enough for a decent life for Gulbairakan and her children. Therefore she decided to further develop her business and she turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 95,000 som (KGS) to purchase sheep for breeding. \r\n\r\nGulbairakan plans

Their nurseries are located at the back of their house since Maura is in charge of preparing these while her husband is ten minutes away from home and in charge of the maintenance and care of the coffee plantation.  \r\n\r\nHer goals are to increase their property, grow and plant more coffee, and make sure her children have a better future and opportunities in life.

She lives in a community of San Tomas la Uni\u00f3n, with her parents and siblings. \r\nMargarita (first from left to right in the photograph) is very disciplined with her occupation. For the last three years, she has worked in the sale of traditional clothing, as this is a good opportunity to generate income. Margarita is a street vendor, she sells in her community and in adjoining places. She needs to expand her sales, but the problem is that she does not have sufficient capital. Because of this problem, Margarita is requesting a loan, and with this money she will purchase more clothing to satisfy her clients. \r\nMargarita is a very supportive person and she likes to share with people. To get a loan, she formed a group, so the other members can generate more income in their businesses and be more successful in life. One of the other reasons why Margarita decided to look for a group loan, is that the guarantee that the institution asks for is accessible, and together they can achieve it. This is the reason for the group loan, but to form the group she looked for responsible people so as not to have problems with payments. \r\nMargarita\u2019s aspirations are to get a space where she can build her own store, and the ideal would be to have it in the market of her community to have a better income.

On her farmland, she grows rice and sells her agricultural product to local dealers. So far, she has been involved with this type of business for around 20 years.

This is why she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES in order to be able to purchase a dairy cow. This will help in producing milk and manure to be used on her farm. Milk from the cow will be sold on the local market and this means improved cash flow.

It is important that her unit is always in a good running condition to ensure efficient service. She is positive that this will boost her income as tricycle transport service is really a need in their area.

Meet Carolyne, 29 years of age, a very hardworking, honest, and dedicated farmer who lives in Kaplamai, a remote village in Kitale. She is happily married and is blessed with three adorable children. <br \/><br \/>She has been practicing mixed farming for the last 10 years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Kitale area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d <br \/><br \/>Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 60,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. <br \/><br \/>Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets, and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan, permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":281.01,"image":{"id":1809788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-06T01:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-08T01:50:06Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.24,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2580.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2655.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2813.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2895.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2980.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3067.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3157},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3249.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3344.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3441.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3542.55},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3646.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3752.63},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3862.31},{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3975.18},{"due_date":"2016-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4091.36},{"due_date":"2016-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4210.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.51},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.85},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.02},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.45},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.72},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.03},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.05,"local_amount":2226.47,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2294.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265104},{"amount":6.03,"local_amount":536.2,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:36Z","rounded_local_amount":552.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601271},{"amount":50.68,"local_amount":4505.09,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4643.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459749},{"amount":23,"local_amount":2061.64,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2124.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.19,"payment_id":681378156},{"amount":26.97,"local_amount":2433.75,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2508.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.41,"payment_id":696587837},{"amount":39.12,"local_amount":3635.93,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3747.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.78,"payment_id":711506133},{"amount":105.92,"local_amount":9580.03,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":9873.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.86,"payment_id":752111126}],"funded_date":"2015-02-25T21:48:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Zoe Benston","image":null}},{"id":836563,"name":"Sataya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sataya works hard to support her family.

She is 60 years old, and is the mother of 4 grown children who are independent.  With the goal of providing for her children, improving her quality of life, and having her own source of income, she launched her clothing and shoe sales business 20 years ago in a stall in the municipal market.  She is requesting a loan to buy the following items in Managua: underwear, children's clothing, shirts for men and women, pants, shorts, and skirts.  In Masaya, she will also purchase shoes to sell at affordable prices to her customers in the city of Bilwi.

It has eight members and it is managed by a board of directors whose president is Mrs. Celia. The businesses handled by the members are diverse, among them: traditional skirt sales, blanket sales, food sale, dry cereals sales, poultry sales, natural products sales, construction services. This loan will benefit a group of small micro businesswomen of which Mrs. Celia is a member. She stated that she has been a member of Pro Mujer for the past two years, joining after being invited by a friend who is a client of the institution. Currently she sells blankets. She also mentioned that this business was started several years ago with a basic loan, having increased her inventory recently with a loan obtained from Pro Mujer. The loan she is asking for now is for an increase in capital (to purchase wool wholesale.) She will buy the wool from the wholesale women suppliers from the city of El Alto,  and after making them she will sell them based on custom orders.

He has a beautiful family comprised of 6 children, and they live in a community of San Antonio Suchitepequez. Francisco is a man who, with lots of effort and dedication, generates income to be able to give what is needed to his family. He lives in a warm location where they extract raw materials such as rubber. Francisco works as a rubber chopper, he extracts this product working in the farms around his community and adjacent farms. He learned this trade from his father at an early age, and familiarized himself with this activity. Besides this job, Francisco also grows corn, which helps complement his income and support his kids. In this second activity, when it is time to harvest the corn, all the family works together to avoid having to pay wages to other people. This way Francisco has been able to survive. Like every father, Francisco tries to find ways to provide for his children.

She is married to Joey, a tricycle driver, and has three kids who are still at the elementary level in school. She and her husband work hard to meet their everyday needs and to support their children's schooling. \r\n\r\nRodema operates a tricycle and has a small general store. Her  husband drives the tricycle, which carries up to four passengers. In the Philippines especially in the provinces like Cavite, the tricycle is a common means of transportation.   Jeepneys and buses are limited. Very few people own a vehicle. The town people usually ride a tricycle from their homes to market, church, to their friends' homes and to other destinations within their community. They even use this transport from one town to the other. She earns a minimum of PHP 800 a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 35,000 loan which she will use for maintenance and gas of her tricycle. She is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment and the financial aid that will be extended to her, for it will surely help cover their daily sustenance and their children's education.  \r\n\r\nRodema dreams of being successful in her business so she can give her children the best education in order for them to have a better future. She prays for the safety of her husband and their passengers. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

He lives in Sana'a city, Yemen. He is a 34-year-old married man and a father of two children. \r\n\r\nNajeb always thinks about making a good future for his family, so three years ago he started his own business selling women's and men's shoes in a small store. The income from his business is very low because he doesn't have enough capital to purchase more goods in order to be able to attract a lot of customers, and most of the money he receives goes to cover some of the necessary expenses of his children. For this reason, he is requesting a loan of 500,000 YER from Kiva's partner, AMB, in order to purchase a variety of types of new and stylish shoes to expand his business.

He farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kitale, which is in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. Jacob is happily married and is blessed with three lovely children. For the past five years, he has been involved in mixed farming and he grows maize and vegetables. He also has dairy cows. Jacob has been able to provide nutritious food for his family. He earns a profit selling a variety of food crops, but he is faced with a challenge of delivering the produce to the market in a timely manner. This challenge has not made him give up and he states, \u201cI have to do something for my family.\u201c Jacob joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring smallholder farmers like Jacob. He is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva lenders, to buy a motorbike. Jacob is from a remote village that has poor roads and transporting his produce to the market has been a challenge. He has suffered many losses of perishable products (e.g. milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) that require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Jacob to achieve his dream and reach his goals. Accessing a financial solution for smallholder farmers in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Jacob feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva, that help smallholder farmers to gain respect and equality among their large scale farmer counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Jacob will never suffer losses due to a delay in delivering produce to the market. He will increase his sales volume because he will be able to transport more goods to the market. His income will increase. Jacob is a man who is making a change for himself and for others in the community because he intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work. Jacob will use the loan to improve his living conditions and assure his children of uninterrupted education and a secure future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":395.56,"image":{"id":1809867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy another motorbike to deliver his products to the market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-06T07:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-08T07:30:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.26,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.16,"local_amount":7832.63,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":7893.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265105},{"amount":38.73,"local_amount":3521.19,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3548.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459751},{"amount":63.47,"local_amount":5817.63,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5862.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.52,"payment_id":681378158},{"amount":19.59,"local_amount":1808.12,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1822.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.3,"payment_id":696587839},{"amount":43.69,"local_amount":4153.87,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4186.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2,"payment_id":711506135},{"amount":138.66,"local_amount":12827.68,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":12927.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.44,"payment_id":752111127}],"funded_date":"2015-02-13T18:07:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":836624,"name":"Gachigi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gachigi is a married woman.

People call her business \"La vecindad\" (the neighborhood) because of all the people who live there.  Pragedes had a vision for the future when she started.  Left a widow with four small children, she knew she could not go out to work and leave them alone.  So she started a business that is still operating today.  With her earnings she has been able to cover household expenses, pay for her children's education and give them a good quality of life.  \r\n\r\nNow she mainly uses her earnings for room maintenance and making her guests comfortable.  Two of her children still live on the same land but they have their own businesses.  They help out by painting the rooms and sweeping the patio, and also care for her.  Before, it was her childen who were her inspiration but now she has become theirs because of their admiration for all she has accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue improving, Pragedes needs to buy paint and four metal sheets to change damaged ones.

She left the job to open her own small salon in her house and serve her clients herself. Darejan will get the opportunity to generate more income from having her own business and not having to depend on the other owners' shares. \r\n\r\nAll of the financial institutions rejected her loan requests because of her unstable financial conditions. After several unsuccessful attempts, Darejan applied for credit from MFO Credo. Her request was approved in the framework of Start Up program, which is joint initiative with Kiva, permitting poor people to start or re-start businesses. With the amount received Darejan plans to purchase all the tools and furniture she needs and also repair the room where she will serve clients. She also has her own loyal costumers and so the loan will be a great help to this motivated woman and her family.

elaboraci\u00f3n de pan. \n\nDon Carlos aprendi\u00f3 el arte de hacer pan desde hace 30 a\u00f1os cuando trabajaba para otra persona, con el sueldo percibido solventaba los gastos de su familia pero su intenci\u00f3n era ahorrar todo lo posible y por alg\u00fan tiempo tambi\u00e9n trabaj\u00f3 en el campo cortando caf\u00e9.

La esposa de Carlos coment\u00f3 que decidieron mantener la casa de madera para no olvidar qui\u00e9nes son y de donde vienen.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo ser\u00e1 de utilidad para la compra de harina, manteca, az\u00facar y colorante para incrementar la producci\u00f3n del pan.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en la panader\u00eda de don Carlos quien viste playera verde.","en":"Somewhere in the Veracruz state, eight people heard about the opportunities to grow that VisionFund Mexico was offering, by giving out loans for business improvement.

Here, it is easy to see how closely the family members work making bread.\r\n\r\nCarlos learned the art of making bread thirty years ago, while working for someone else. He covered the home expenses with his salary, but his intention was to save as much as possible. He also worked in the countryside, picking coffee. Finally, twenty years ago Carlos could make his dream come true and opened his own bakery, where he works with his wife, his sister, his mother-in-law, and his youngest child, who is 22. In addition, two members of this group work with him and help him to distribute the bread to more distant communities.\r\n\r\n \u201cI opened the bakery in the back of my house. I built a stone oven, where we still bake bread. The unique flavor is given by the firewood we use, and guarantees my bakery\u2019s stability.\u201d Bread is baked two times a day at Carlos\u2019s, in order to have all the bread that is sold every day.\r\n\r\nWith the profits they receive, they have been able to improve their living conditions: they could remodel their wooden house. Carlos\u2019s wife says that they wanted to keep the original wood in order to remember their origin.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be of great help to buy flour, butter, sugar, and coloring, and increase their bread production.\r\n\r\n* The picture was taken in Carlos\u2019s bakery.

He was doing only half an acre of maize crop per season and some dairy farming. The returns were so meager that he could barely fend for survival. He kept doing maize farming for years without turning a profit until 2013, when he switched to tomato farming and there was light at the end of the tunnel for Sammy. \r\n\r\nToday, Sammy is a fully-fledged entrepreneur. He has been provided with technical guidance, training programs and exposure visits. He has already serviced other asset-based loans fully from Juhudi Kilimo. Through the loans, he has acquired high-quality dairy cows, farm supplies and poultry.\r\n \r\nTo capitalize more on returns from the booming tomato farming, Sammy is seeking a loan of KES 50,000 to build a greenhouse. Unlike his competition, Sammy conducts proper soil preparation and uses modern farming techniques to ensure high-quality produce. By doing this, he has created a name for himself and a demand for his produce. \r\n\r\nYour lending will contribute greatly to the actualization of Sammy\u2019s goal, which is to expand the greenhouse house.

La situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica, el incremento de los gastos y la falta de empleo para personas sin estudios fue lo que la motiv\u00f3 a iniciar una actividad, por ello desde hace ya 4 a\u00f1os abri\u00f3 una peque\u00f1a tienda de abarrotes ubicada en su hogar, lo que adem\u00e1s le permite pasar suficiente tiempo con su familia. \"Lo mejor de mi tienda es que obtengo ingresos con los cuales apoyo a mi esposo con los gastos y juntos brindamos una mejor calidad de vida\u201d.\n\nUn poco triste, Petra coment\u00f3 que hace dos a\u00f1os los ingresos en su tienda se vieron afectados pues en la contra esquina de su casa abrieron otro establecimiento igual. Ella pens\u00f3 que ser\u00eda el fin de su negocio, pero se dio cuenta que su buen trato a las personas podr\u00eda hacer la diferencia y sigui\u00f3 recibiendo a sus clientes de la mejor manera. Para mantener un buen n\u00famero de productos, Petra necesita invertir en az\u00facar, arroz, frijol, aceite, sopa, caf\u00e9, leche, queso, galletas y detergente.\n\n\u201cMe invitaron al grupo y no lo pens\u00e9, s\u00e9 que el pr\u00e9stamo otorgado me beneficiar\u00e1 incrementando la mercanc\u00eda y las ganancias lo cual significa un gran cambio, gracias a cada uno de los que hacen posible el pr\u00e9stamo.\u201d\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en una de las calles del barrio.

The members chose the name because of the characteristics of this fruit: it is high up, it is extremely useful, and many people enjoy it. \r\n\r\nThe group is made up of 7 hard-working women who are committed to themselves and their families, for whom they work day after day to the best of their abilities. The members and their activities are: \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda - shoes by catalog\r\nCarolina, Isabel - clothing\r\nTeresa - chicken\r\nLaura - sweets\r\nMarcelina - pork  \r\nPetra - groceries\r\n\r\nPetra is an outstanding woman, the mother of 6 children, of whom 4 are minors. Her economic situation, rising expenses, and the lack of jobs for people without higher education were the factors that motivated her to start a business. Because of this, four years ago she opened a small grocery store, which is located in her home. In addition, it lets her spend enough time with her family. \"The best thing about my store is that I obtain income with which I help my husband with the expenses, and together we provide a better quality of life.\" \r\n\r\nA little sadly, Petra comments that for the past two years her income from the store has been affected by the opening of a similar store on the corner across from her house. She thought that this would be the end of her business, but she noticed that her excellent customer service could make the difference, and she continued welcoming customers in the same way. To maintain a good stock of products, Petra needs to invest in sugar, rice, beans, oil, soups, coffee, milk, cheese, cookies and detergent. \r\n\r\n\u201cThey invited me to the group and I didn't think twice about it. I know that the loan provided will benefit me, expanding my merchandise and my profits, which will mean a great opportunity.

Dairy farming is close to his heart and every day he wakes up to milk his cow and that makes him very proud. \r\n\r\nAlthough he makes profits through milk selling, he lacks a chaff cutter. He is requesting a loan to buy a chaff cutter. Through the loan, he will be able to buy a chaff cutter which is a mechanical device used in cutting hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forage for better feeding of the cow. The chaff cutter also prevents the animals from rejecting any part of the food.

Knowing each other for more than twenty years and being good neighbors brought them together to request loans from VisionFund M\u00e9xico.  With the loans, they have improved their businesses little by little, and with their earnings they are able to offer their families better qualities of life.

She started her business with the recommendation of one of her friends, who introduced her to the company employee in charge of deliveries in their area.  This is the first loan that Guadalupe has requested, and she will use the money primarily to purchase perfumes. \r\n\r\nLupe, as she is known in her community, uses her earnings to purchase more products to sell and to help her husband with the household expenses, as there are six people in her family.  What she likes most about her business is that the company motivates them and recognizes their efforts.  She has earned various prizes for meeting her sales goals. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe more I invest, the more I earn.  I am grateful to the communal bank for inviting me to be a part of their family.

This loan will enable him to expand his operations to increase the overall output.\r\n\r\nThe additional income from the expansion will go toward his children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is increasingly becoming prohibitive to low-income communities, especially in the rural areas.

overlooking the incredible Lake Atitlan. The cobbled streets of Concepcion are lined with expertly planted fields of onions, beans, carrots, cabbage, corn and chamomile. Families work together harvesting and preparing vegetables and fruits that are shipped and sold all over the western half of the country. Nine hardworking women of Concepcion make up the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cChuisequec.\u201d \r\n\r\n\u201cChuisequec\u201d is applying for their second KIVA funded group loan, after a successful loan period in 2014. With the harvest season underway for many of the regions crops and replanting season rapidly approaching, these small loans are very important for the livelihoods of the women and their families. Irma, a twenty-one-year-old mother of two children, is one of the youngest members of the group.  Irma is applying for her second loan with Friendship Bridge to maintain and grow her business selling fruits. Irma buys fresh, locally grown fruits from small farmers in Concepcion, and travels daily to the capital, over three hours away to sell delicious watermelon, mango, pineapple and oranges. With this loan, Irma will have the ability to buy more fruit and expand her daily inventory to compete with other venders. Irma works extremely hard to improve and grow her business and subsequently the quality of life of her two young children. Irma hopes that as she gains more knowledge about managing a small business, through the monthly educational training led by her Friendship Bridge loan officer, and experience from her daily fruit sales, she will be able to create a more profitable business. As her children grow older she hopes to support them through school, in order to give them the opportunity to receive a full education. \r\nThanks to KIVA investors, Irma will have the chance to continue to grow as an entrepreneur and work towards the goal of improving the quality of life of her family. Thank you KIVA investors for your continued support of Irma and the rest of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cChuisequec.\u201d \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":1810005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fresh watermelon, pineapple, mango and oranges.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San jose Chacaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.766667 -91.216667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-02-06T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-08T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":4125,"lender_count":121,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zoida Hortencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Florinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma Estela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":31500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":3150,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:37:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636216842},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":3150,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649567043},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":3150,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665049199},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":3150,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347058},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":3150,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3156.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696557415},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":3150,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:37:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3156.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711472375},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":3150,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3156.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730991462},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":3150,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3156.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752079730}],"funded_date":"2015-02-25T10:04:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Richard Neuman","image":null}},{"id":836692,"name":"Linda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linda is a 36-year-old married mother with of child, who has been selling vinyl plastic table covers and clothes for seven years.

Manuela's dream is to finish building her home and to buy more plots of land so that she can contintue to grow coffee."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1809327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to maintain her coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2015-02-06T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-08T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":14000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.29,"local_amount":501.67,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":507.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624777181},{"amount":6.34,"local_amount":48,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":48.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636134604},{"amount":3.87,"local_amount":29.28,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":29.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649489818},{"amount":1773.5,"local_amount":13421.05,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":13564.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664972379}],"funded_date":"2015-02-09T18:19:16Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:14:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caroline Reiss","image":798183}},{"id":836777,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":168.32,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"to invest in a 16-cubic meter Sistema Biobolsa biodigester.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":226,"posted_date":"2015-02-06T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-08T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8540,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":8540}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":94.26,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1401.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624387858},{"amount":74.06,"local_amount":1100,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-22T12:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1101.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649726223}],"funded_date":"2015-02-09T16:35:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":836763,"name":"Nenita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nenita lives in Sindangan, Philippines.

His business is making jigsaw puzzles for kids. He's entrepreneurial, independent, dependable, responsible and hard-working. He runs his business in the \"16 de Julio\" area, an area known for its fairs on Thursdays and Sundays, where you can find anything from sewing needles to tractors for planting. The climate is cold (4-12 degrees centigrade) and has intense sunlight that can cause sunburns, with an average elevation of 3800 meters above sea level. \r\n\r\nHugo has a dark complexion, short black hair, is short, his native language is Aymara and he speaks Spanish because of the overall culture and the business that he's involved in. He lives with his daughter who's attending school, and they reside in the family home that's made out of bricks and has potable water, electricity, and gas. His business is the production of jigsaw puzzles, a job that he learned as a carpenter's assistant and he then began working independently. The jigsaw production process is done in several stages, such as: sending the design to the printer, punching the outline, framing, and packaging. He states that \"Our jigsaws are ideal for use in kindergartens, they're an alternative that's affordable, entertaining, and helpful for stimulating children's imagination\". His dream is to expand his workshop and hire operators to manage the company. He wants to purchase plywood wholesale to make jigsaw puzzles. This is the fourth loan series he has engaged in with the institution in the 9 years that he has worked in this sector.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons that Hugo is applying for a loan to purchase plywood wholesale to make jigsaw puzzles for kids.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1796273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To purchase plywood wholesale to make jigsaw puzzles for kids.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-02-06T17:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-08T17:50:01Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hugo Eduardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":512.43},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":480.32},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":545.79},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":532.45},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":559.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":566.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":588.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":596.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":627.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":643.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":660.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":685.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.03},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.97},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.89},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":145.4,"local_amount":992.98,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624227081},{"amount":79.98,"local_amount":546.21,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":552.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214265},{"amount":77.87,"local_amount":531.8,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":537.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564387},{"amount":81.89,"local_amount":559.26,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":565.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046354},{"amount":83.08,"local_amount":567.4,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":573.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344177},{"amount":556.78,"local_amount":3802.35,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3846,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554408}],"funded_date":"2015-02-08T17:59:24Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Manolo Rodriguez","image":null}},{"id":836809,"name":"Allena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Allena is 55 years old and has three children.

In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store selling fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are food and essential household items. She earns a profit by buying supplies at wholesale prices and then selling them by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and her local community. She earns a minimum net income of 700 PHP a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, Sonia is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy items such as canned goods, instant noodles, soda, and other groceries. She is positive that this loan will help boost her income as she expands her business. She thanks God and you in advance for both a good turnout of her business and the financial help that will be given her. She is sure it will help in their daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nSonia aims to maintain and grow her business so she will be able to have a better life. She prays for good health and love in her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She's independent, generous, understanding, patient, responsible, and hard-working. She does her work in the \"1ro de Mayo\" area, a place known for the constant growth of its population and commerce in every sector. It's a location that brings together different cultures and ethnicities from the mountain plateaus. It's elevation is 4,070 meters above sea level, which makes it the city with the second highest elevation in the world. \r\n\r\nBlanca has a dark complexion, long black hair that she ties, dark eyes, and her native language is Aymara but she speaks spanish because of the overall culture and because of the business she's involved in (in the picture she's standing in the first spot on the right side, wearing a beige jacket and a black sweater). She lives with her husband who runs the business, her children are independent and don't live with them, and the house she lives in with her husband is built out of brick, with a corrugated iron roof, and has potable water, electricity, sewage service, and natural gas. \r\n\r\nThe need to expand her business drove her to form a group of people that own businesses like selling quilts, making leather wallets, transportation services, making skirts, a video store, selling meat pies, selling silverware, and selling cell phones, to apply for a loan. Her business is baking and selling pastries and desserts, a business that she launched at home with a minimal investment by selling sandwich cookies, vanilla cakes, and chocolate pastries with ingredients that are easy to find in the market. As she made back her capital, she invested it in desserts for sale to her customers. She says, \"Who doesn't like a chocolate pastry or a vanilla cake?

It is very hard to find employment in her village, yet she must support her family and raise her children. This is why Gulayim has been engaged in farm work since 1989. At present she has two cows. She also leases a land plot of 1.0 ha, where she and her husband grow rice for sale. Their monthly revenue is 15,000 KGS. In order to develop her farm further, Gulayim has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 60,000 KGS to increase her livestock. Gulayim plans to invest her revenues in an additional livestock increase.

She was able to take care of it, diligently and on time. \r\n\r\nShe purchased fertilizers, organic compost, and leaf fertilizer among others, which she used to protect and improve the production. She was also able to pay for the labor to collect the grain which helped her get excellent profits when it was sold. It also contributed to get a better income for her family and her household.\r\n\r\nThanks to the financial aid, her situation improved a lot. She was able to paid off some debt, and able to pay off the loan. She is thankful for this.\r\n\r\nShe hopes this time she gets the same help as last time.

Through her previous loans, Zeinab was able to improve and increase her business production, through buying special seeds and seedlings to increase her family's income. <br \/><br \/>Zeinab will work hard to develop her grocery store more in the future, either through moving to a wider place or through making attractive decorations."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":668,"image":{"id":1810326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase her business merchandise with special offer products, in addition to pasting floor tiles in her store to make it a better looking place.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Qana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2015-02-06T20:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-08T20:10:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zeinab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":87},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87,"local_amount":87,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636138515},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649776022},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665265571},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681271700},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:23:51Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696481594},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:26:58Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711390006},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730913551}],"funded_date":"2015-02-10T02:40:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Marie Phillips","image":1667620}},{"id":836874,"name":"Carmela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmela is a 63-year-old married woman and a mother of six grown-up children.

Ainiza plans to invest profits from the loan in further developing her business and in home repairs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1806767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy organic potatoes for resale and some sheep in order to increase her livestock headcount.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ichke-Jerkez village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-02-06T20:10:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-08T20:10:19Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ainiza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":34000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":580.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":6127.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624799512},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":10213.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636161681},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:41:28Z","rounded_local_amount":10213.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649514066},{"amount":580.84,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:49:32Z","rounded_local_amount":34725.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995832}],"funded_date":"2015-02-06T22:26:28Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:49:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":836873,"name":"Ofelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ofelia is 55 years old and a widow with six children, two of whom are in school.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by raising pigs in the Philippines.

Therefore, Shehnaz Begum has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

Her business is a shoe shop. She is enterprising, independent, knowledgeable in business, sociable, responsible, and hardworking. Her business is done in the south of the city, a place that once a year gathers together about 1000 artisans in a fair called the \"Alasita\" where all kinds of miniature goods are offered with the purpose of this miniature version materializing and becoming reality. The climate is warm, tropical, and very humid with a constant temperature of 30 degrees Celsius all year.\r\n\r\nMaria has a dark complexion, short height, and short black hair. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed and she speaks Spanish for culture and for the commerce she is engaged in (She is seated in the center of the photo). Her life is shared with her partner who makes a living in construction and with her younger son who studies in school. Her older children are independent and live in their own house made of brick with a corrugated iron roof. They have drinkable water, electricity, and sewage.\r\n\r\nHer desires to excel have led her to lead a bank of people with business such as: transport services, making leather wallets, sale of empanadas, machine knitting, technical service of equipment, sale of furniture, sale of quilts and making of skirts. They are asking for a loan to improve their businesses.\r\n\r\nHer business is the fabrication of shoes, specifically in the \"cholita\" tradition (traditional woman, wearing a hat, blanket, and skirt). She started her work in the sewing of shoes, later specializing in the \"cholita\" shoes. Her creations are original, making shoes to order, for folk dance groups and orders that have a bulk delivery. \"Each year there is a variety of shoe models, the vast majority are worked in cloth.
