Today Sveta has 2 cows, 1 bull and 15 sheep. Sveta also sells milk and dairy products daily. Her combined monthly income amounts to about 8,000 som (KGS). Because this money is not enough for a decent life, Sveta, to further develop her business, requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy a dairy cow in order to increase the sales volume of ecologically clean, home milk, which will help her improve her family's welfare.

Meet Ann, a very hardworking and honest mother who decided that she would be independent and contribute to her community by starting dairy farming in Thika, Kenya. Deciding what kind of farming she would do was not difficult. \u201cI was brought up with dairy cows raised by my grandfather and grandmother,\u201d Ann said. \u201cIt is in my blood.\u201d She passionately loves dairy farming and has been practicing it for the past 15 years. She has never regretted starting to farm. <p>\r\n\r\nHer primary sources of income is milk, eggs, and crop farming. Milking and feeding her own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. She is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in her village. Profits from milk sales have enabled her take care of her family and she has always yearned to produce more dairy milk. The major challenge she faces is feeding her cows. <p>\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy a chaff cutter. A chaff cutter is a mechanical device for cutting hay into small pieces before being mixed together with other forage to feed the cattle. Through the loan her cows will be aided in digestion and they will never reject any part of the food. Ann strongly believes that through proper feeding of the cows she will reap more and it will lead to increased milk production which will translate into more sales and a better income. Through this loan, Ann\u2019s life is going to change permanently. Because of this high milk production potential, she will save more money to fully repay the loan. She believes that through careful selection and the application of the strict standard of excellence in keeping her dairy cows, she will have more income, which will improve her living standards. Wonderful lenders you can be a participant in the evolution of this enterprising mother, by lending her capital, so that she can increase her milk production."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":465.79,"image":{"id":1810408,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

All of the family members actively help with the household. Zyinat has a secondary education and has been involved in animal husbandry for 22 years, having started this business with a purchase of one heifer. Thanks to Zyinat's hard work, she was able to develop and expand her business to have 2 cow, 7 sheep and also 0.5 hectares of leased land, where she grows barley for sale. She has all of the conditions for keeping livestock. Zyinat's profit amounts to 10,000 som (KGS) per month. Because this money is catastrophically not enough for a decent life for Zyinat and her family, Zyinat, to further develop her business, requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy a cow for fattening up. The earnings from the loan will allow Zyinat to expand her business, improve her family's welfare and build large and spacious barns for livestock."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":610.82,"image":{"id":1806774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a cow for fattening up in order to grow her earnings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Gulcha village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-02-06T22:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-08T22:40:05Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.94,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zyinat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3573},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3671},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3772},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3876},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3983},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4092},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4205},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4320},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4439},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4561},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4687},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4821}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.41},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.89},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.71},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.56},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.49},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.68},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.15,"local_amount":7244,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":7362.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636161682},{"amount":64.12,"local_amount":3772,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3833.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649514068},{"amount":65.89,"local_amount":3876,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:49:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3939.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995833},{"amount":67.71,"local_amount":3983,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4048.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291256},{"amount":69.56,"local_amount":4092,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4158.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500468},{"amount":70.03,"local_amount":4205,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:04:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4273.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.46,"payment_id":711411412},{"amount":70.43,"local_amount":4320,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:58:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4390.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.01,"payment_id":730933662},{"amount":68.99,"local_amount":4439,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":4511.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.47,"payment_id":752025689}],"funded_date":"2015-03-01T18:10:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":827562,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The borrower is married and lives with his family.

She has a secondary education.  By nature, she is very hardworking and she has a positive outlook on life.  She works in animal husbandry: she bought her first livestock with an initial amount of 15,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has two cows on her farm, she also grows potatoes and onions on 1.23 hectare of land, and she gets cherries from her garden.  Additionally, she buys fruits and vegetables from the local residents, and she resells these produce at the market.  The whole family helps her to run the farming business.  She makes a monthly income of 8,000 som (KGS).  \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her activity, Latopat has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of $1,000 (USD) which will be used to buy sheep for breeding as well as feed for her livestock.  Latopat is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further increase her number of domestic animals.

The Start Up program created by Kiva and Credo enabled Avtandil to get a loan of 800 USD. He will renovate the house and rent it seasonally, as the city he lives in is full of tourists seasonally. The family will get the chance to get significant income even during the season, which will enable them to cover everyday costs, as well as expand the business in the future.

The farming individuals are commonly elderly people between the ages of 45-65 years. However, James has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture. At the age of 30 years, he is a proud owner of a farm, where he plants maize and vegetables and keeps dairy cows. The farm is in the Itibo, Nyamira area of Kenya. James practices agriculture with a difference, employing youthful energy, enthusiasm, and knowledge attained from the agricultural training he has undergone with Juhudi Kilimo. James also operates a side hustle business to supplement the meager income he earns. \r\n\r\nJames sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg selling; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. The Nyamira area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. That is why James is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike, he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. \r\n\r\nJames is very determined to succeed. Because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans that through accumulated profits, he will be able to provide a secure future for himself, and also for his ageing parents. James\u2019s dream is to go back to school, and he hopes that through your loan, you will help him realize his dream. James greatest yearning is to succeed with his dairy farming and be able to have the best economic opportunities in his household to progress together with his family.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1810474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Though her responsibilities are critical to her family\u2019s well-being, this is considered a mere duty in Kenya, a job with little appreciation. Janet's husband, Joseph, manages their small farm, earning $100 per year. Even though his small income keeps the family living in poverty, he still claims the position of breadwinner in the household, as is the case in most households in Kenya. Financial support far outweighs any other care or support for the family, leaving women disadvantaged to make decisions within the household, and forcing them to fully depend on their husbands to buy everything, from laundry soap to the food they eat. Until this cultural dogma shifts, it is critical that women have opportunities to participate in money-making activities. \r\n\r\nWith the little time Janet has, she sells crops from their small farm and also keeps dairy cows and poultry. Janet is seeking a loan of 90,000 KES to build a greenhouse. Nyamira area has recently witnessed a surge in the tomato farming business. To capitalize more on returns from the booming tomato farming, Janet is seeking to build a greenhouse. Unlike her competition, Janet conducts proper soil preparation and uses modern farming techniques to ensure high quality produce. By doing this, she has created a name for herself and a demand for her produce. Your lending will contribute greatly to the actualization of Janet\u2019s goal, which is to expand the greenhouse. In the future, she is also planning to introduce zero grazing method, intensify her maize farming, and start value addition.\r\nThrough this loan Janet will not only increase her income, but also reduce her income vulnerability.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":653.52,"image":{"id":1810492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to construct a greenhouse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-07T01:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-09T01:20:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.59,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6369.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6555.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6747.3},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6944.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7147.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7356.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7571.32},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7792.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8020.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8254.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8495.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8744.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.97},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.42},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.13},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.72},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.4},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":173.86,"local_amount":15647.29,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":15876.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265112},{"amount":145.38,"local_amount":13084.06,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":13275.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459761},{"amount":155.39,"local_amount":14242.78,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":14451.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.86,"payment_id":696587846},{"amount":171.3,"local_amount":15842.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:00Z","rounded_local_amount":16074.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.73,"payment_id":731022967}],"funded_date":"2015-02-09T18:45:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":837032,"name":"Alijon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alijon, born in 1971, is an active person who lives in a rural area.

with no children.  She has a secondary education.  In 2011, right after she finished school, she became involved in animal husbandry and agriculture as her main occupation.  Thanks to her very hard work, she now has eight cows and one calf on her farm and she also grows clover and corn on 1.4 hectare of irrigated land.  Her farming activity brings her an income of about 20,000 som (KGS).

She works on an informal basis, selling clothing and costume jewelry door to door, which is how she earns her own income to help with the household expenses and their daughter\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nHer husband has a shop in partnership with his father, in which they sell cheese and eggs.  They buy them wholesale, and distribute them by the pound to their customers, who buy this food daily.  She has been engaged in this occupation for more than 12 years, and her husband, even longer.  With these occupations, they provide for their family honestly.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy clothing, costume jewelry, cheese, and eggs.  She has been in the credit group for five years, and she likes it because the loans are much needed. Her dream is to have her own shop.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1809367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase clothing, costume jewelry, cheese, and eggs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2015-02-07T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-09T01:40:03Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1631.6,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":135.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":135.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":135.97},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":135.97},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135.97},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":135.97},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":135.97},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":135.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":135.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":135.97},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":135.97},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":135.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.51,"local_amount":135.97,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:30:01Z","rounded_local_amount":137.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624232596},{"amount":275.02,"local_amount":271.94,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":275.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636218339},{"amount":412.51,"local_amount":407.91,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":412.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649569985},{"amount":275,"local_amount":271.94,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665050521},{"amount":275,"local_amount":271.94,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:52:01Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681348330},{"amount":274.96,"local_amount":271.9,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":274.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696558699}],"funded_date":"2015-02-20T11:28:01Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:53:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanora Brennan","image":null}},{"id":837037,"name":"Azra Bibi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Azra Bibi, 42 years old, lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

She lives in the countryside and she works the land, according to the season.  Her husband also seasonally goes to Russia to find work.  Like many rural residents, Orzigul is involved in fattening cattle.  This activity constitutes the main source of income for her family.  Orzigul became involved in animal husbandry when she was still young.  Realizing how difficult it was for her parents to support the family, she decided to help them, and then she started to support her own family with the same activity. Orzigul doesn't want her children to suffer like she did; she would actually like them to get a decent education.  At the moment cattle prices are quite low and Orzigul's business is going through a difficult time.

She is 53 years old, married and has 5 children.\r\n\r\nMary likes to think of herself as a very hardworking individual. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2013 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to help more farmers.

She is a group leader, often described as a very hard-working individual, and is representing her group of 16 farmers from the Matete district of Kenya. Since joining One Acre Fund in 2012, Jael has noticed that she has learnt a lot from the farming training they provide.\r\n\r\nJael described her harvest as excellent last year, but believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. She is very excited to also be buying a solar light, in addition to fertilizer and maize, because she will now be able to have an overall improved quality of life. With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to invest in a business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Jael\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of seven acres of land and purchase a total of 13 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1799786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for growing maize.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-02-07T11:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-09T11:30:01Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Okito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peninah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Metrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackson","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Okito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josphat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prisila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":130160,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130160}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-17T16:25:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Seiji Humphries","image":null}},{"id":837113,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah is married with three children, all of whom go to school.

He provides the family's household necessities from the store, and his relatives also like to buy from it. His voice has an impressive, even tone and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and manner, he has built up very good relations with his customers. His general store is very famous in the town, which is why it does well. In fact, his sales have increased a lot, but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand. Thus, Nusrat has requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy more stock of wheat, rice, flour, pulses, soaps, shampoo, detergents and biscuits.

Meet Florence, a 29-year-old mother who is very kind, loving, and charming. She is based in Kebirigo, a remote village in the Nyamira area of Kenya. She is happily married and has four children that depend on her for the basic needs. \r\n\r\nFor the past sixteen years, she has been involved in mixed farming on her small piece of land. Her primary sources of income are milk, tea, egg selling, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves poultry farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about poultry farming, her response was \u201cfeeding my poultry.\u201d \r\n\r\nShe sells eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and, because of high-quality eggs, customers have been streaming into her compound, and the demand has been overwhelming. To be able to meet the demand, she is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry.

He lives with his wife in a sector of the municipality of Cofrad\u00eda, Cortes. Juan is always looking for a way to generate income. He has always worked as a day laborer, but nine years ago he decided to start buying and gathering disposable materials to resell. He collects or buys plastic containers, copper, aluminum, or steel items, as well as pieces of iron, etc. to sell them to recycling facilities.

Judiah is a very hardworking woman who enjoys farming, which she has been doing on her small piece of land for the past five years. Through all those years, she has gained much experience and is one of the most respected farmers in her village. Because of the immense knowledge that she has of farming, Judiah offers extension services to other farmers who are new in the business. <br \/><br \/>Being a caring and loving mother, Judiah has been able to take care of her family and support them through the profits she has earned from farming. Although Judiah reaps much profit from farming, one challenge that she is facing that is dragging her behind and preventing her from \u201creaching on top of the skies\u201d is a lack of enough land to farm. For this reason, Judiah is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 to be able to buy a piece of land and expand her farming activities. <br \/><br \/>Having so much experience in farming, Judiah is sure that she will make good use of the land and double her profit levels.

Meet Joseph, a 41-year-old hardworking, humble and loving man who cherishes his family so much. Joseph is a proud father of lovely children who he really loves, and you can always notice a pleasant feeling when he arrives at the house every day in the evening. \r\n\r\nJoseph is a passionate farmer who has been doing farming for the past 12 years. He possesses a wealth of experience, and most of the villagers come for farming advice from him. \r\n\r\nJoseph practices mixed farming through keeping dairy animals and doing crop farming, and through this, he has been able to provide a decent life to his family. Although he has been making profits, the income he is getting is not enough to fully satisfy his basic needs. That is why he has decided to keep poultry as a way of making ends meet. \r\n\r\nJoseph is seeking a loan of 15,000 KES to buy poultry and use the space in his farm to make more profits. The Kericho area is known to have demand for eggs and poultry products. Therefore, Joseph is sure of a ready market, and this has really motivated him to turn his dream into reality. Being a very hardworking man, Joseph sells the fruits of his labour in the nearby markets and will also want to do the same with the poultry products, hence creating more income. \r\n\r\nJoseph is very keen to provide all the necessities to his family and is sure that through the loan, he will be able to achieve this target.

She buys products such as wafers, tea, sugar, and chocolate in bulk from the wholesale market in town, and sells them in her neighborhood through her small shop. Each month, this 32-year-old mother of three contributes to 40% of her family\u2019s monthly income. She sets aside the entire amount as savings, and runs the house with only her husband\u2019s earnings of  6,000 INR each month. Lilaben has a singular goal: to see that all her three children receive a college education and uplift themselves. She is always on the lookout for ways to improve her savings so she can realize this goal. She is aware that their current financial situation is quite inadequate.\r\n\r\nNow, Lilaben wants to grow her general shop\u2019s revenues and profits by catering to more local customers. She also plans to negotiate better rates with her suppliers by increasing the size of her stock orders. She specifically wants to purchase more of the popular wafers and chocolate, and stock up on the quick-selling sugar and tea. She estimates this will boost her profits by 6,000 INR each month. Of this, she plans to add 2,000 INR to her monthly savings, boosting it by 50%. The rest, she will reinvest in growing her business further. \r\n\r\nThis bold plan needs capital, and local banks do not provide microcredit to borrowers like Lilaben. So, Lilaben has banded together with two more women with similar goals: Gendiben also runs a general shop, and Ratniben sells vegetables.

matriarch of a family in the western Indian state of Gujarat. Settled in the semi-rural part of the Ahmedabad district, her family of four survives on a monthly income of 12,500 INR. Extremely diligent with her finances, Shardaben saves almost half of this amount to build a financially stable future for her family. She also runs her own handicraft business, which contributes towards 20% of her family\u2019s income. \r\n\r\nShe uses string to weave together artificial gemstones, fake pearls, and beads to make beautiful \"rakhis.\" These rakhis are ceremonial threads that Indian sisters tie to their brothers\u2019 wrists, seeking a promise of love and brotherly protection. Her business sees a huge boost in sales and profits during the Raksha Bandhan festival around August. Shardaben spends the preceding months working hard to prepare for this boost. Handicraft businesses like hers from Ahmedabad source rakhis to expat Indian communities around the world. \r\n\r\nHoping to deliver on a bigger order for rakhis this year, Shardaben wants to buy more raw materials, like beads and artificial gemstones and pearls. The capital she needs to make this purchase, however, is a too small for local banks to finance. Unwilling to rely on private local lenders who charge exploitative interest rates, she has formed a group with four other local micro-entrepreneurs. Ramilaben and Kantaben make rakhis, Rekhaben sells decoration items, and Monaben runs a small provisions store. All these five women want to grow their respective microenterprises and better provide for their families. Together, they seek a loan of 75,000 INR, which they will repay in monthly installments from their increased incomes. \r\n\r\nYour loan will help Shardaben boost her income by an impressive 60%, and will set five families on the path to a financially stable future. Shardaben and her group members thank you for your timely support in their endeavors."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":816.68,"image":{"id":1810128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy raw materials like beads and artificial gemstones to make more handicraft \"rakhis\" for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Chandkheda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":428,"posted_date":"2015-02-07T17:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-09T17:10:10Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rekhaben","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramilaben","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shardaben","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monaben","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kantaben","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":102.09,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-20T11:03:04Z","rounded_local_amount":6303.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636638979},{"amount":102.09,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":6303.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649620384},{"amount":102.09,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6303.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665100443},{"amount":102.09,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6303.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681398524},{"amount":102.08,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:20:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6303.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696608690},{"amount":102.08,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":6303.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711532444},{"amount":102.08,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6303.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731046988},{"amount":102.08,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":6303.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752135733}],"funded_date":"2015-02-10T03:43:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":837188,"name":"Shyam Mahila Mandal Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"24-year-old Jyotsnaben (at center in the picture) is the young mother of a toddler from the Ahmedabad district of Gujarat, in western India.

She takes orders from local customers, and sews dresses, curtains, and falls and interlocks for the traditional Indian saris that her clients prefer to wear. \r\n\r\nHer small young family lives off an income of 11,500 INR each month, and she contributes 3,500 INR to these earnings. Diligently, she sets aside 3,000 INR in savings each month. As Jyotsnaben lives in semi-urban Gujarat, there is never a shortage of orders. Seeing the potential for growth, she wants to buy a better professional sewing machine. The upgrade will help her increase her productivity and bring in an extra 2,500 INR each month. This will help Jyotsnaben grow her monthly savings by more than 80%. By the time her child is of school-going age, the savings she is building will cover fees for a good local school.\r\n\r\nJyotsnaben has her plans all laid out, and the only thing stopping her now is a lack of funds to invest in the new sewing machine. Undaunted, she has formed a joint-liability group with four of her friends who also seek to grow their own small microenterprises. Three of her group members are also seamstresses, and a fourth sells ready-made garments. Together, they seek a loan of 75,000 INR to invest in their respective small businesses. Being a joint-liability group, they will hold each other accountable to use the funds wisely and make the loan repayments on time. \r\n\r\nYour loan will help Jyotsnaben and her group take a crucial step towards realizing their business potential and goals for their families.

Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines; people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. She also has a small general store, and sells mineral water as well. She earns a minimum of Php1,500 in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan which she will use to buy recyclable materials from collectors, and partly to add some grocery items to her general store. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Her earnings help fund their living expenditures. She is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment, and the financial help that will be given her.\r\n  \r\nRosalie aims for her businesses to prosper to help her grandchildren attend school. She prays that her family will be found faithful, and live a life pleasing to God. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

For a long time he has been working as a builder. He learned this trade due to accompanying his father to work from a young age, which he had to do since his parents' poverty meant he did not have the opportunity to study, so this is how Juan earns a living.\r\n\r\nBut when Juan does not have building work, he works as a day laborer with his neighbors. Juan says that it is not good to only know one profession. From the effort he has put in, Juan now has adult children, who with their incomes also support the family's costs. In this way they are fighting for their survival. Now Juan has managed to build a house, but still needs to refurbish the two bedrooms although he does not have the funds to do this. He is requesting a loan to finish the job. He will have his children's support when it comes to repaying the loan.\r\n\r\nThe family's wish, and above all the father's wish is to be able to start with the refurbishment so that his children can

Some time ago, nine enthusiastic women formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMaria del Rosario\u201d group with the goals of developing themselves and their small businesses and helping their families.\r\n\r\nJuana is a 32-year-old member of the Trust Bank who is married with a large family. She has five children who range in age from 1 1\/2 years to 13 years. Juana had limited access to education, but because of her vision of a better life and the responsibilities of so many children, she has been highly motivated to succeed in her small businesses. Juana has a small convenience store as well as a bookstore. The businesses are open from Monday through Saturday, 6 a.m to 7 p.m. She is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase oil, sugar, rice, beans, noodles and eggs for the convenience store. Juana also plans to buy useful school supplies for the bookstore such as pencils, pens, paper and notebooks. There is a lot of demand right now as the new school year has just begun.\r\n\r\nEach month, a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer comes to the meeting of the Trust Bank. She oversees business transactions on the loans and then, in the indigenous language of the women, shares practical information with them. This combination of small loans and education is what Friendship Bridge calls \u201cMicrocredit Plus.\" The ladies learn to successfully manage their loans when they learn about budgeting, pricing, marketing, accounting and customer service.

She carries on her business in the \u201c12 de Octubre\u201d Zone, in the city of El Alto, which is characterized by informal commerce.\r\n\r\nTrinidad is petite, with tan skin and long black hair.  Her mother tongue is Aymara, and she speaks Spanish for business.  She lives with her son in her relatives\u2019 house, which is made of brick and has potable water and electricity.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling meat, and the cuts that she sells the most are top loin, sirloin tip, rump, and eye of rump.  She works out of a room in her house that is adapted to be a butcher shop, and also as a neighborhood grocery, because she sells soft drinks, eggs, vegetables, etc.  She says, \u201cI used to sell meat in the street until I had many customers, and decided to rent a shop and open my butcher shop\u201d.\r\n\r\nShe wants to use the loan to purchase lamb to sell, as this product is requested at the end of the year for making Picana, a traditional dish during the Christmas season. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan cycle with Kiva in the 9 years that she has been engaged in this occupation.  These are the reasons that Trinidad is requesting a loan: to purchase carne cordero in order to offer more variety to her customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5075,"image":{"id":1787989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase lamb.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-02-07T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-09T20:30:02Z","loan_amount":5075,"lender_count":119,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Trinidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Daria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria Casilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filomena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"  Mario Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":5075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3527.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4126.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4243.89},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4364.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4488.95},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4616.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4748.16},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4883.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":511.54},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":598.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":615.36},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":632.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650.9},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":669.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":688.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":708.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1725.23,"local_amount":11898.14,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":11920.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214254},{"amount":632.88,"local_amount":4364.7,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4372.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564376},{"amount":650.9,"local_amount":4488.95,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4497.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046343},{"amount":669.43,"local_amount":4616.73,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4625.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344168},{"amount":1396.56,"local_amount":9631.48,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":9649.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554401}],"funded_date":"2015-03-09T20:28:42Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanora Brennan","image":null}},{"id":826396,"name":"El Carmen-74 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosmery es una mujer de 44 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su pareja, tiene 2 hijos de 2 y 12 a\u00f1os, y su negocio es la tapicer\u00eda.\n\u00c9lla es independiente, emprendedora, activa, constante, responsable y trabajadora.

She lives with her partner and has two children aged 2 and 12.  She is in the upholstery business.\r\n\r\nShe is independent, entrepreneurial, active, persevering, responsible and a hard-worker.  She carries out her business in the area \u201cMutualista'\u201d a commercial area located in the center of the city characterized by the grouping together of company offices, universities and institutions.  The climate is warm, tropical and humid, with an approximate temperature of between 21 and 35 degrees Centigrade all day.\r\n\r\nRosemery is a short dark-complexioned woman with long, black, tied-back hair and dark eyes.  Her mother tongue is Guarani which she speaks with her family.  She speaks Spanish because of the general culture and for business.  She is the second on the left in the photo wearing a white blouse and beige bermudas.\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her partner who works in commerce and with her children.  The oldest is in school and the youngest has not yet reached school age.  They live in a house belonging to the family, made of brick with a corrugated-metal roof, that has potable water, electricity and a sewer system.\r\n\r\nHer business is upholstery, an occupation that she learned from her family.  She practices the trade of covering with fabric, tapestry or leather the seats of house chairs, automobiles or motorcycles, securing the material with tacks, staples or sewing.  She also works to improve the comfort of the seats by installing springs, foam or vegetable fibers in the interior. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of her work is to achieve comfort and beauty in the seats that she upholsters.  The tools that she mostly uses are scissors, upholstery hammer, manual or pneumatic stapling gun, compressor, chalk to mark the fabric, sewing machine, small crowbar to take out staples and tacks, rubber hammer, curved needle for hand-sewing, long needles for putting on buttons, punch, wire-cutters, tape measure, square and other things.\r\n\r\n\u201cI upholster all types of furniture and automobile seats and I can also make curtains and whatever creation that needs a sewing machine,\u201d she comments.  Her dream is to be the preferred business in the area.  \r\n\r\nShe wishes to make an investment in her business by buying fabric, tapestry material and tools wholesale due to the fact that the fabrics and tapestries get used up quickly and the tools are in a bad state due to their continual use. This is her second loan sequence with the institution in the ten years that she has been doing this occupation.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Rosmery is asking for a loan to buy fabric, tapestry material and tools to renovate her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":1790477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Upholstery","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, tapestry material and tools to renovate her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-02-07T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-09T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ericka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3807.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3781.44},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3950.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4025.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4160.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4274.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":551.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":547.52},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":572.02},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":582.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":602.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":618.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1098.86,"local_amount":7589.27,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":7592.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624227077},{"amount":572.02,"local_amount":3950.67,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3952.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214261},{"amount":582.81,"local_amount":4025.13,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:30:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4026.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564383},{"amount":1221.31,"local_amount":8434.93,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:13Z","rounded_local_amount":8438.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046350}],"funded_date":"2015-02-08T06:37:30Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rita","image":null}},{"id":836728,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9 es un hombre trabajador que tiene la edad de 57 a\u00f1os y demuestra que a su edad a\u00fan mantiene las ganas de seguir super\u00e1ndose para seguir ofreciendo a su familia un nivel de vida acorde a la del pa\u00eds, es propietario de una muebler\u00eda donde su principal producci\u00f3n son las sillas abuelitas, cuenta con una experiencia de treinta a\u00f1os en la elaboraci\u00f3n de muebles, es el segundo ciclo que solicita en ADIM el financiamiento para su negocio y este cr\u00e9dito lo solicita para la compra de un motor con su mesa, esto le permitir\u00e1 aumentar la producci\u00f3n y por ende sus ingresos.","en":"Jose is a hard-working man who is 57 years old and demonstrates that despite his age, he still has the desire to continue advancing, in order to offer his family a level of life that is in accord with that of his country.

Do\u00f1a Antonieta feels very fortunate with her businesses, as with her friendly service, she is able to make sales. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Antonieta wants to maintain her store always stocked, and that is why she is requesting a loan to purchase more merchandise for daily consumption and more skirts, sashes, and blouses, in order to always have clothing available for her clientele. \r\n\r\nShe is certain that she will always make sales in order to generate more income and above all, earnings with which she will be paying off her loan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Antonieta's dream is to generate more income so that she can have her savings to survive on when she is older. She is also thinking of converting a part of her house into shops in order to rent them out.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":467.2,"image":{"id":1810069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

It is focused on the area of education, orientation, enrichment and academic training for the pre-school and primary levels.

","en":"Bakhodir is a 27-year old man, married, with one child. Bakhdir lives in a rural area, far from town. Like many men in rural area, Bakhodir periodically travels to Russia for seasonal work. His wife helps him to take care of the household and in the summer takes on farm work as a hired laborer. Eventually, after being able to save up some money, Bakhodir opened a grocery store in his village, got his business going and started to do improvements on his house. Since he was not able to complete his education, he would like to make sure that his children have access to good education. At present Bakhodir is doing renovations  in his house, and is running short  on funds needed to complete the work. This is why he has applied to Arvand for financial support. He would like to use his loan to complete the renovations. Bakhodir expresses his gratitude for financial help offered to rural dwellers like himself.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":715.46,"image":{"id":1799625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

She lives in a rural area. She has been raising livestock since her youth. She was not able to get an education and so she has been raising livestock all ofher life. Her husband works as a taxi driver on the side in the evening, and during the day helps Haitjon. His earnings are barely enough to support the household, and thus raising livestock is the family's main source of income. Haitjon takes care of the animals, and her husband handles the buying and selling part. They work very hard to be able to provide for their children's education, so that their children would not  experience financial hardships like them. Haitjon is taking out a loan to buy more cattle and increase her livestock.

","en":"Ayibjon is 22 years old.  He grew up in a rural part of the Oqteppa district.  Since childhood, Ayibjon has been interested in buying and selling.  His father often took him to the market where he bought and sold cattle.  Since they lived in the countryside, their family also grew rice.  Ayibjon's father taught him to work early on and often repeated the sayings \"What your heart loves, your hands should do\" and \"The more you put in, the more you get back out.\"  This early love for work has made Ayibjon a hard working, earnest, and independent man.  He is married and has a young daughter.  They live in their own home, where his wife works sewing traditional women's clothing.\r\n\r\nAyibjon has a stall at the market where he sells men's clothing.  He would like to take out a loan in order to expand his business.  As a result, he will be able to further improve life for his family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":698.72,"image":{"id":1799582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to
