She has 2 sons which go to school and work the fields with their father after they get out of school. All 4 of them live together.  \r\nMaria has been working in agriculture for 20 years.  Her father taught her how to grow coffee as well as pineapple and plantains due to the excellent yield and economic benefits of these crops in the market.  \r\nMaria was very interested in learning this kind of work when she had to leave school and she strived to learn as much as she could since she saw it as a way of earning a living and so it turned out to be.  Her coffee plantation is very close to her home so she can keep a close eye on the crops which is a big advantage.  \r\nShe's requesting the loan to buy coffee formula, 12-24-12 fertilizer, ammonium nitrate, 46% urea, insecticide, and other materials to take care of and maintain her coffee plants.

He's entrepreneurial, independent, responsible, and hard working.  He works in the neighborhood of Batallas close to Lake Titicaca, an agricultural area known for cattle raising, including alpacas, cows, sheep, and pigs.  The population lives from fishing as well as agriculture, tubers, vegetables, and cereals from the region, like quinoa, green beans, and potatoes, among others. The region is characterized by a cold and dry climate with a temperature between 1-12 degrees celsius and the sun is very strong.  \r\nFlorencio is of tanned complexion, short height, short black hair, and wears a hat.  His native tongue is Aymara but he also speaks Spanish because of the general culture and because of his business.   He shares his life with his wife who also works in agriculture (his sons are already independent) and they live in an adobe house with a zinc roof which has electricty and they get water from a well.  \r\nHis business is selling cattle.  He buys the animals, fattens them, gives them all the necessary vaccines, and once they are big and fat he sells them.  He also sells milk to cheese producers in the area.  He mentions that \"the droughts really affect the whole community because the cows become thin and produce less milk.  His dream is to have many cows.  \r\nFlorencio is requesting this loan to buy more cattle to fatten it during the rainy season because there is more grass for feeding them.

He is the first born in a family of three. He says being first born comes with a lot of expectations from his family. He describes himself as hardworking and friendly. Yona is requesting his first Kiva loan to start running his own business in Blantyre, Malawi.\r\n\r\nYona has completed training with Zoona to start operating his own mobile money transfer service. He will set up his business outside of one of the busiest and well-known supermarkets in Blantyre in an area called Limbi. His business will help people in the community to send and receive money throughout Malawi. His main customers will be people who are unbanked and need to move their monies safely.\r\n\r\nYona has requested a Kiva loan so that he can pay for his set up costs. This loan will be used to serve customers by providing him with float. Float is the money that Yona will use in his business on a daily basis to serve customers. The loan will also be used to purchase a small trading kiosk, which he will place outside of the supermarket to serve his customers. He will also purchase a mobile phone, which he will use to make the actual transactions.

Actualmente el carro que tiene para realizar las entregas se encuentra averiado causando gastos extras en transporte para la entrega de prendas. Su sue\u00f1o es tener sucursales en toda la ciudad y desea reparar su veh\u00edculo para realizar las entregas de la ropa limpia. Esta es la primera secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 19 a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Rolando solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la reparaci\u00f3n de su veh\u00edculo para realizar las entregas de ropa limpia a domicilio.\n","en":"Rolando is a 42-year-old man. He is married and has one son, who is 11 years old. His business is running a dry cleaning service. He is independent, reliable, active, responsable, and hardworking. Ronaldo runs his business in the \"Cota Cota\" neighborhood, a residential area known for its quality businesses and its warm and dry climate.\r\n\r\nRolando has a darker complexion, short black hair, and is short. His native tongue is alymar\u00e1, although he no longer uses it; he speaks Spanish for his business. His wife helps him with his work and his son is studying in school. They live together in a house made of bricks, and they count on potable water, sewage services, and electricity in their home.\r\n\r\nAt his dry cleaning business, Rolando dedicates himself to removing the stains and dirt from the linings and interlinings of clothing. He also works with garments that specifically indicate that they must be dry cleaned. Humidity can damage this type of clothing, and so he is sure to use specialized cleaning products and processes that will keep the garments in a good state and free of grease, oil, wax or gum stains. Ronaldo says that he worked for five years as a cleaning assistant; he was then able to purchase his own machine, which is what he currently uses at his business.\r\n\r\nDue to the demand of his business, he works more than ten hours each day, taking turns with his wife when they need to deliver the clean clothing to customers\u00b4 homes. The car they currently use is unreliable and damaged, and so they have had to incur extra costs in order to return customers\u00b4 clothing on time. \r\n\r\nRolando\u00b4s dream is to have branches of his business throughout the entire city. He would also like to repair his vehicle so that he can make the deliveries. This is the first time that Rolando has requested a loan in the 19 years that he has had his business. Rolando will use the loan to repair the car that he uses to deliver the clean clothes to his customers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":722.14,"image":{"id":1808425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Laundry","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

His main responsibility is to take care of his three siblings. He is 21 years old and lives alone in Blantyre, Malawi. Moses completed training with Zoona and is requesting a loan to start running his own Zoona mobile money transfer business in Blantyre. His business will service people in his community who need access to financial services.\r\n\r\nMoses has faced a lot of hardships in his life. He has had to take care of himself from the time he was in high school, as his parents could not afford to. He learnt how to fix computers and would charge people a small fee so that he could buy food and pay for his school fees.\r\n\r\nToday, Moses is happy for the opportunity to be connected to Kiva lenders through Zoona. He explains that getting a loan in Malawi is not easy. He tried to access a small loan to start running his own computer engineering business, but no bank would give him money as he does not have collateral. He hopes that being connected to the Kiva lenders will help his dream of becoming an entrepreneur become a reality.\r\n\r\nMoses has requested a loan to access the working capital he needs to get his Zoona business off the ground and start serving his community. With this loan, he will pay for his setup costs, which include buying a branded trading kiosk, framed fee posters, some uniforms, an Internet-enabled mobile phone, a cashbox and a chair.

She is 33 years old. She is married and has five children. Three of them go to school. Her husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation, because he could not find work in his native land. He tries to work a lot so that his family does not starve. He sends the money he earns home. \r\n\r\nRajabmo is also hardworking. She loves to work. She currently sews women's clothing. She learnt to cut and sew two years ago. Rajabmo would like to purchase a new sewing machine because the old one does not fulfill its function well. \r\n\r\nTo improve her work processes, Rajabmo needs to get a loan to purchase a new sewing machine. Therefore she applied for a loan. She understands how difficult it is for her husband to provide for the family, and would like to help him and sew clothing on order."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1807788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Olmedo\u2019s sources of wealth are agriculture \u2013 including crops of coffee, chocolate, bananas, plantains, corn, rice and citrus fruits \u2013 and large tracts of pasture for cattle.  \r\n\r\nIn this place lives Se\u00f1ora Lucia, who is 70 years old, is married and has five grown children. Her husband does not work, and they live together in their own home. \r\n\r\nIn order to get by, Do\u00f1a Lucia together with her family has a small grocery store in her house where she sells all types of products such as rice, sugar, oil, detergent, vegetables, greens and fruits. She works everyday from 6:00 am until 8:00 pm \u2013 and sometimes much later. \r\n\r\nA grandson that lives with her and her husband helps her with the business when he is not busy. But, it is Do\u00f1a Lucia who spends the most time at the store because that is where she likes to be as she makes a living and learns about the news around her neighborhood. She has made a living through this business for 30 years, and it is going well. \r\n\r\nShe is going to use this loan to stock her store more. She will buy rice, sugar, oil, detergent, meats and other staple products. She has been in a borrower group for three years, and she has liked the unity of the group \u2013 and that the loans are much quicker and easier without as many documents. Her goals are to continue advancing her business and grow her store more every day. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1810878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, oil, detergent, meats and other staple products.

years old, married, and she has three children.  She has a secondary education.  As the main source of income for her family, she has been involved in farming since 2006.  She started in this business with an initial capital of 15,000 som (KGS).  She currently owns three cows and 60 sheep, and she sells milk.  She also grows beans and clover on three hectares of her own land and six hectares of leased land.  Gulmira's entire organic production is in high demand and brings a good profit of about 10,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her farming business, Gulmira has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  This loan will help her to buy a dairy cow (in order to produce and sell higher volumes of organic milk) and some mineral fertilizers for farming.  She is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further expand her business, which will allow her to give a decent education to her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":418.75,"image":{"id":1808249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase one dairy cow and some fertilizers in order to increase the income she gets from the sale of organic farming products.

With her last loan, she increased her inventory. Trinidad is a single mother of five children; she only lives with 2 of them. She works and lives in the rural town in Hato Mayor. She will use this loan to buy cement to cover her concrete block walls and also will buy windows to finish building her house. \r\n\r\nEsperanza International Dominican Republic runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their businesses and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time running their business and attending their group meetings.

She sells second-hand clothing and for the past eight years has also run a small grocery store. Her household consists of her son, who is in the third grade, a niece who also lives with her, and their housekeeper. A top priority for Glenda is ensuring that she can meet her son's basic needs and provide for his education. Glenda herself is a high school graduate who studied liberal arts, sciences, and information technology. \r\n\r\nGlenda gets up early every morning to earn a living, attending to her clothing business and her store when she's not working with her coffee crops. This is the time of year, however, when the coffee plants need more attention so that the beans will grow large and the crop will be profitable. Glenda is therefore applying for a loan for the purchase of supplies that she needs for the harvest: 12-24-12 manure, organic manure, fertilizers, growth formula.

She has a 22-year-old son and an 8-year-old daughter. Her business is the sales of bookstore items.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, independent, enterprising, patient, a good listener, caring, responsible, and she works hard.\r\n\r\nShe sells as a street vendor in the \"Pampahasi\" zone, which is known for its origins: Aymar\u00e1 farmers fighting for independence from the Spanish rule entrenched the zone and settled there. This zone is on a slope of the city on steep, high streets. It is an area of cold, dry climate throughout the year.\r\n\r\nEva has a dark complexion, short stature, and long braided black hair. Her mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1, spoken at home, and she also knows Spanish, spoken in the community and which she uses for business. She shares her life with her children who are studying, the older pursuing a technical degree, the younger in primary school. They live in a family home that has running water, sewer service, and electricity.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living selling bookstore items, such as pencils, pens, notebooks, white paper sheets, colored paper, rulers, markers, etc. She works all day from Monday to Saturday. Sunday is for the family, taking a stroll, and cleaning the house.\r\n\r\nShe has steady sales for her bookstore items, since she sells close to the schools. Sales go down during school vacations, time that she uses for inventorying and restocking. \"When classes start, I sell non-stop. During vacations, I switch to inventorying, that's a good time for it\" she comments. She dreams of having a bookstore.\r\n\r\nEva wants to replenish her stock with school materials such as books, school texts, storybooks, notebooks, and other items. She wants to begin the new school year ready with all the necessary supplies, and this is why she is asking for the loan.\r\n\r\nThis is her first cycle of loans with the institution in the five years that she's been doing this work."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":579.58,"image":{"id":1811050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy school items in order to restock her supplies and receive the children with all school materials available.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-02-09T15:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-11T15:30:04Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":342.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":394.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":390.07},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":407.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":430.7},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":449},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":463.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":484.08},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":502.31},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":532.03},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":552.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":551.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.51},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.08},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.35},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.85},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51.32,"local_amount":342.12,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":352.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624227095},{"amount":59.2,"local_amount":394.65,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":406.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214279},{"amount":58.51,"local_amount":390.07,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":401.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564400},{"amount":61.08,"local_amount":407.19,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":419,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046367},{"amount":65.12,"local_amount":434.12,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:39:29Z","rounded_local_amount":446.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344188},{"amount":66.9,"local_amount":446,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:09Z","rounded_local_amount":458.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554419},{"amount":69.49,"local_amount":463.3,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:27:34Z","rounded_local_amount":476.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468555},{"amount":72.75,"local_amount":485.01,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:16Z","rounded_local_amount":499.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296422},{"amount":75.21,"local_amount":501.38,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:03:50Z","rounded_local_amount":515.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076676}],"funded_date":"2015-02-13T21:22:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":837624,"name":"Lucitania","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucitania, from the city of Hato Mayor, is taking a housing loan.

Nubia was just 22 years old and her family's financial situation was tenuous; her mother couldn't afford to pay her tuition. Nubia therefore decided to start a business selling tortillas in order to earn income to pay for her studies and help her family. She's been running the business for two years now and has also earned a university degree. Nubia, however, has not yet fulfilled her ambitions, and has started a second business buying clothing and accessories and selling them from her home. She's fortunate to have the support of her mother, which makes her feel more secure as she starts this second business.  \r\n\r\nNubia wants to keep growing her new business, so she's applying for a loan to purchase clothing and accessories: school uniforms, shoes, socks, backpacks and lunchboxes. Such a variety of items will help Nubia generate higher income and continue fulfilling her ambitions to run a successful business. She hopes in the future to find a job in the field she studied in college.

Now it\u2019s time for you to meet one of Ruma's agents, Romi. Romi lives in South Bogor, West Java, located about an hour drive from Jakarta, the capital city. He joined Ruma almost a year ago. Romi owns a stall where he sells daily consumer products and provides mobile services for his community. He feels happy because Ruma\u2019s sales executive is really helpful and informative.\r\n\r\nRight now, Romi is becoming an agent of Ruma\u2019s new product called Mapan. Mapan is e-commerce for lower communities. By providing Mapan to his customers, Romi will be able to receive orders from customers who want to buy products that have been listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer orders, Romi will simply send an SMS in a format to the SMS center and then the customer will pay him. After that, Ruma\u2019s agent will come to his stall to collect the money and within 3-5 days, the product will be delivered right to customer's door.\r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Romi is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile payment services to his community. Your loan will be very useful to help Romi improve his business and accordingly, his community who needs access to such services. \r\n\r\nAs seen in the photo, Romi is the one who is standing in his own stall. He will be thankful for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1811456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to provide more mobile services for his community","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bogor Selatan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-02-09T16:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-11T16:10:13Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Romi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":12000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":12000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-10T18:08:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":837632,"name":"Shamim Ara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shamim Ara is 45 years old and an active borrower of BRAC Pakistan.

Kampong Chhnang province in Cambodia. She makes some income from selling fish at a market. Her husband is a 50-year-old fisherman. Two of her children work in a factory and the youngest one attends school.

She works selling second-hand clothes. Roxana is a good mother, entrepreneurial, independent, pleasant, sociable, responsible, and hardworking. She works in the southern part of the city, an area where, once a year, nearly one thousand craftspeople gather in the La Alasita fair to sell miniatures of every kind with the goal of making this miniature wish come true. The city has a hot and very humid tropical climate, and a nearly constant temperature of 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) throughout the year. \r\n\r\nRoxana is dark-skinned, short, and black-haired (she is shown in the photograph in the center, seated, and wearing a dark mauve shirt). Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family. She also speaks Spanish to communicate more widely and to conduct her business. She lives with her children. The oldest works and the minors go to school. They rent a brick house with a corrugated metal roof, which has running water, electricity, and sewer service. \r\n\r\nRoxana's desire for self-improvement motivated her to become the leader of a communal bank for business people (in areas such as transportation, fabrication of leather handbags, salte\u00f1a (a kind of turnover) sales, machine weaving, equipment repair, furniture sales, duvet sales, and sewing of traditional skirts) to request loans and improve their businesses. Her business is to sell second-hand clothes such as pants, belts, short-sleeved shirts, Bermuda shorts, and others. Roxana works every weekday during the day as a street vendor, she says, \"giving clothes a second chance to the benefit of both buyers and sellers\". Her dream is to have a sportswear store and stop having to wander around. She would like to buy second-hand clothes wholesale and be able to meet demand during this season. Thus, Roxana is requesting a loan to buy second-hand clothes wholesale to resell and pay the general expenses of her two youngest children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5775,"image":{"id":1811060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy second-hand clothes wholesale to resell and pay the general expenses of her two youngest children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-02-09T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-11T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":5775,"lender_count":118,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Elsy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Verena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ysaura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":39500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3705.27},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3994.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4015.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4141.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4405.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4546.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4685.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4906.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5098.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":583.96},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.09},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":605.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":644.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":664.76},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":685.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":717.41},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":745.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1125.68,"local_amount":7699.47,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:30:25Z","rounded_local_amount":7722.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214280},{"amount":587.09,"local_amount":4015.56,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4027.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564401},{"amount":605.46,"local_amount":4141.26,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4153.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046368},{"amount":644.13,"local_amount":4405.75,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4418.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344189},{"amount":664.76,"local_amount":4546.84,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4560.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554420},{"amount":685.1,"local_amount":4685.96,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4699.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468556},{"amount":717.41,"local_amount":4906.93,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4921.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296423},{"amount":745.37,"local_amount":5098.23,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5113.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076677}],"funded_date":"2015-03-10T20:25:53Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:03:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lebzylisbeth Gonzalez","image":null}},{"id":837460,"name":"Lorenzo Javier","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Son pocos los j\u00f3venes como Lorenzo  que a sus diecinueve a\u00f1os de edad ya tienen trazados sus objetivos. \u00c9l est\u00e1 seguro que se va a sentir totalmente pleno cuando alcance su superaci\u00f3n profesional.

He lives there with his wife and his two children. He just joined Ruma a month ago.  He was interested in joining Ruma because he heard a lot about Ruma's services. His community sees him as a trusted mobile service provider and he has a friendly and cheerful personality as well.<br \/><br \/>Right now, Husnul is becoming an agent of Ruma\u2019s product called Mapan. Mapan is an e-commerce for lower communities. By serving Mapan to his customers, Husnul will be able to receive orders from customers who want to buy products that have been listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer orders, Husnul will simply send an SMS in a format to the SMS center and then the customer will pay him. After that, Ruma\u2019s agent will come to his stall to collect the money and within 3-5 days, the product will be delivered right to the customer's door.<br \/><br \/>As the business starts to run, Husnul is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile payment services to his community. Having known about its importance, your loan will be very useful to help Husnul improve his business and accordingly, his community which needs access to such services. As seen in the photo, Husnul is the one who is sitting and holding a Mapan poster. He thanks you for your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1811472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to provide more mobile services to his community","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bogor Selatan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-02-09T18:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-11T18:30:07Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Husnul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":17500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":17500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-10T22:33:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":837729,"name":"Kufunafuna Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Married with five children, Florence owns a grocery store in her community.

Married to Roberto, her driver, she has three children who are still in the elementary level in school. She manages their household while operating a transport business.\n\nRona owns and oversees the operation of her jeepney service. She has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) of jeepney. Jeepneys are the most common form of public transport throughout the many islands of the Philippines. Most of the time, the jeepneys are constantly packed with passengers. They are one of the remnants of the American military presence in the Philippines during the Second World War, and are still seen throughout the Philippines, in many colors and all over the place. Originally, jeepneys were old American jeeps. They were used in the war against the Japanese army who occupied the Philippines for several years. After the Japanese army was defeated and the American military mission was completed, the jeeps were left by the tens of thousands on the islands in the Philippines. The Filipinos saw possibilities to make out of these jeeps. They saw a real transportation means by making these jeeps about two meters longer and by putting two long seats in them, one on each side from the front to the back. Since then, jeepneys have been used as small buses for cheap transport of people, goods, and even sometimes little animals. \n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Rona is requesting a PHP 8000 loan, which she will use for repairs and maintenance of her jeepney. It is very important that her unit is always in good running condition to ensure efficient service. Her husband drives it, so she is assured that her jeepney is well taken cared of.  She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her for it funds schooling of her children and cover their daily sustenance.\n\nRona hopes that their transport service will continue to be successful. She dreams for her children to get the best education. She prays for the safety of her husband in driving and for a better future for all of them. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\n\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

cultivating corn to produce their forage. He used to spend an important portion of his available income on LP gas and chemical fertilizers, and decided to invest in his biodigester to save money. Indeed, he will now be able to use his cows' manure as a resource and transform it into biogas and organic fertilizer. The biogas will be directly connected to his cookstove and boiler in the house, displacing fossil fuel-based LP gas. At the same time, the nutrient-rich organic fertilizer will replace chemical inputs, nourish the soils and increase the yield of Te\u00f3filo's corn field in a sustainable way. The untreated waste will no longer contaminate underground water sources, nor attract flies, while wood fuel will also be eliminated from the house, leading to improved health conditions for the whole family, as they will not inhale the toxic smoke anymore. With the savings Te\u00f3filo generates, he plans to put a roof on the backyard, and buy better quality food for his cows. This loan represents 20% of the total cost of the biodigester, the remaining part being covered by a government subsidy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1809291,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"to acquire an 8 m3 Sistema Biobolsa biodigester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acatl\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":226,"posted_date":"2015-02-09T20:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-11T20:20:22Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.79,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Te\u00f3filo Rompan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6030,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":6030}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":1005,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1038.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624387855},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":3015,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-22T12:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3115.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649726221},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":1005,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-22T12:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1038.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681523103},{"amount":34.72,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:53:49Z","rounded_local_amount":516.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.52,"payment_id":696728651},{"amount":34.33,"local_amount":505,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T18:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":521.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.27,"payment_id":711660198}],"funded_date":"2015-02-09T21:26:26Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T18:31:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jen Nevins","image":1066904}},{"id":837799,"name":"Hanh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanh is a 38-year-old married woman.

Irma decided to increase her family's income and requests a loan for a business start up. The Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva and Credo, enables her to get a loan of 550 GEL. With the received credit Irma will purchase clothes at wholesale prices and then will resell among her villagers with the price marked up. This will give her a chance to increase her income and improve the living conditions for her daughter."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":171.28,"image":{"id":1811720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase clothes at wholesale prices and then resell with the price marked up in order to increase her family's income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kaspi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2015-02-09T21:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-11T21:00:12Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.65,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":34.82},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":39.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.55},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":42.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":44.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":45.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":46.51},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":49.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":51.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":52.65},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":54.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.41},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.26},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.32},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.37,"local_amount":34.82,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:30:59Z","rounded_local_amount":35.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.04,"payment_id":636277304},{"amount":18.84,"local_amount":39.82,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":40.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.07,"payment_id":649613314},{"amount":20.78,"local_amount":41.55,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:02:37Z","rounded_local_amount":42.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665093049},{"amount":20.97,"local_amount":42.38,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":43.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.22,"payment_id":681390812},{"amount":21.31,"local_amount":44.11,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":44.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.75,"payment_id":696601124},{"amount":21.02,"local_amount":45.1,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":45.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.53,"payment_id":711520474},{"amount":21.81,"local_amount":46.51,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":47.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.45,"payment_id":731036302},{"amount":22.53,"local_amount":48.23,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:54:29Z","rounded_local_amount":49.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.59,"payment_id":752125165}],"funded_date":"2015-02-10T21:35:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jim Brule","image":840348}},{"id":837773,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1182.9,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":" to purchase clothing.

She's a good mother and an independent, hardworking, persevering, and very responsible woman.\r\n\r\nHer business is baking cakes.  She works in a market in the Plan 3000 area, known for its ongoing population growth from nomadic tribes in the area such as the Ayoreos and miners who migrated from the western part of the country; they made this place their home and generated constant commerce in all the areas.\r\n\r\nRuth is short and dark, and she wears her long black hair in a pony tail and dresses fashionably.  (She's seated in the middle, wearing a pink blouse.)  Her native language is Guarani and she speaks Spanish for cultural reasons and for her business.  \r\n\r\nShe lives with her four children.  The three older ones attend school and the youngest plays all day.  They live in their own house made of corrugated metal and brick, and they have running water, electricity, and a sewage system.\r\n\r\nAs a result of her family and business needs she formed a bank with people with businesses like a neighborhood store, a butcher shop, sandwich sales, plaster handicrafts, soft drink sales, a bookstore, and clothing sales.  Their objective was to request a loan and prosper in their commercial activities.\r\n\r\nRuth's business is making and selling cakes and desserts.  She started from home, making a minimal investment with sales of \"alfajores\" [sandwich cookies], vanilla cakes, and chocolate cakes that have ingredients that are easy to find in the market.
