year old Asaph's business philosophy emphasizes the virtues of hard work and perseverance. The last two years, this father of two has been showing his mettle in the cutthroat motorcycle transportation business in Bushenyi. He started bearing a hand in this business to earn his wherewithal for survival. Prior to that, he was engaged in the lucrative banana sales trade. He is still involved in the banana business because he is able to earn substantially from it. Therefore, he sees no reason to dispense with it. He has a banana plantation where he grows the bananas that he harvests and, at length, sells. \r\n\r\nIt's only been two years in the motorcycle transport business for Asaph but, with his sky-high optimism, the sky may be the only limit! Success, he believes, is on the horizon. Among his other calling cards, his close friends speak highly of his tenacity, determination and his good-humored way of going about his business.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

from the city of Chiclayo.  Like many in the region, he makes his living from fishing anchovies, but the open fishery season only lasts one month, starting in November.  For this reason, three years ago he began a business to distribute fresh fish, an activity that helps sustain his family during the rest of the year.\r\n\r\nJuan Manuel goes three times per week to the fishing terminal of his city (ECOPHINSA) to buy fish brought in to market for refrigeration; he then distributes the fish to buyers in the cities of Ja\u00e9n and Bagua.\r\nDue to climactic and other factors, the region's fishery is in decline, which has led to increased prices for the main commercial fish species.  These difficutlies are why Juan Manuel is seeking a loan for 900 soles from Edpyme Alternativa, so as to be able to buy more product and sustain his business.\r\n \r\nIn the long term, he hopes to buy his own refrigerated container to distribute fish and transport the product more easily without paying others for this service; in this way he could save more on costs and invest additional income in improvements to his house to better care for his children and family.  Juan Manuel is a respected man in his community and considered both honorable and hard-working.\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matthew Cassetta, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":391019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buying fresh fish for distribution and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Santa Rosa - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-09-19T09:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":78.08},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":80.34},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":81.92},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":87.68},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":93.99},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":101.09},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":104.37},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":108.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.58},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.2},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.01},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.58},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.69},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.58,"local_amount":70.84,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":74.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939722},{"amount":28.2,"local_amount":78.08,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":81.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780630},{"amount":29.01,"local_amount":80.34,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:24Z","rounded_local_amount":84.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669530},{"amount":29.58,"local_amount":81.92,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":85.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065037},{"amount":31.66,"local_amount":87.68,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:16Z","rounded_local_amount":91.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900151},{"amount":33.65,"local_amount":93.18,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":97.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934286},{"amount":33.94,"local_amount":93.99,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:56Z","rounded_local_amount":98.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661926},{"amount":36.51,"local_amount":101.09,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":105.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694642},{"amount":37.69,"local_amount":104.37,"processed_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:13Z","rounded_local_amount":109.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877707},{"amount":39.18,"local_amount":108.51,"processed_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":113.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617760}],"funded_date":"2009-09-20T01:16:59Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matthew Cassetta","image":260079}},{"id":142347,"name":"Marcelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maricel is 50 years old and she is managing a sari-sari store (community based store) in their village for almost seven years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In 2000, she established her furniture-making business. Working seven days a week, 9 hours a day, she suports her family. She has already received, and successfully repaid, three loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to purchase wood and timber. In the future, Astamaiya plans to send her children to private school. She thanks you for your support.    \r\n\r\nIn Nepal, furniture is still made the old-fashioned way. Using little more than basic hand tools, skilled artisans make raw lumber into beautifully finished pieces of furniture. With precision and an eye for detail, furniture makers produce shelves, bed frames, and cabinet sets. With the help of a Kiva loan, a a furniture maker is able to increase the volume of lumber purchases or hire additional labor. This additional leverage allows an entrepreneur to increase productivity and profitability. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

The local TYM Fund allowed Mrs.O. and other women to borrow money to run business. At first, Mrs. O. borrowed 40 USD to invest in breeding the pigs. As time passed by, she went from having 3,4 pigs to 20-30 pigs each farrow. Each year, she released 60-70 pigs from the pigsty. Her income from breeding the pigs allows her to send her children to school and build a nice house.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.  But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 34 years old. Arlene is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Arlene raises pigs for sale. Arlene has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Arlene joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services. She wished to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Arlene is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Arlene from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

What Elizabeth does not like are the seasons when farmers grow a large quantity of vegetables because they flood the market and she can't make good profits.  In this season she is leaving her pea crop to dry.  She will convert it into seed and will sell sacks of pea seed at a higher price in the central market in Tarma which will allow her to stabilize her finances.\r\n\r\nWith all the good decisions that she has made, Elizabeth is thinking of opening a restaurant in her area because there isn't one at present.\r\n\r\nThis is Elizabeth's eighth loan with MFP and, as a young woman, she assures us that her community bank plays a predominant role in her life since it helps her to grow and set herself new goals.

The group members decided to give the group this name as the district where they live goes by the same name, and all the members are from there. \r\n\r\nThis description is about Mrs Elena V. M., who is the group's representative. She is married to Felipe, who is 27, and they have 2 children - Anelis and Maricela, who both study. The oldest is in the first year of primary school and the other is in the first year of preschool. Elena has a cake shop (selling cakes, flans, jellies and desserts). \r\n\r\nElena decided to start her business as she says that there is a lot of demand. She sells from her home and generates good profits, as she also has many clients. Elena has had her business for more than 5 years. She will invest this loan in purchase more ingredients and primary materials such as butter, moulds, gelatin, baking powder, flour, eggs, yeast and some fruits, to continue making her products. \r\n\r\nWith the earnings fro her business she is saving to construct a cement wall in her house and is also helping her husband to maintain the household, although the costs aren't large as their children as still small. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that her business is benefitting many of her district's neighbours, as there aren't many people who sells this type of products nearby,  as all the shops are in the town and Elena takes advantage of the fact that some of her neighbours don't like going into the centre. As she is closer, they come to her to buy, and also because of the attention and services that she gives them. \r\n\r\nElena's dream is to one day build her own shop in her house and install a cake shop. This is her biggestdream, to improve and increase her earnings and continue to support her children with their studies and give them a secure future. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that the group members are very responsible, punctual and hard-working people, as she has known them for a long time and they get along well, as they all live in the same community. \r\n\r\nElena is very thankful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva for the support that this loan has given her, as thanks to this her business is improving a lot. \r\n\r\nThe members of Lomita and their respective activities are:\r\n\r\nIrma G.

casa de do\u00f1a Marybel esta una presa grandisima y la gente viene a pescar y tambien hay gente que todavia viene a lavar su ropa, es una comunidad indigena y por eso existen estas costumbres todavia, Do\u00f1a Marybel se dedica a la engorda de reces, y solicit\u00f3 su prestamo para comprar el alimento como zacate molido y engordar los toros, no cr\u00eda reces solo las engorda para que en poco tiempo pueda venderlas, ya tiene un cliente que semana tras semana le compra una res, uno de los desafios que enfrento en mi negocio es que el zacate cada dia es mas caro y yo nesecito bastante para que mis reces engorden bien, pero yo ya no le puedo subir mas al precio de mi res para que me recupere porque si lo hago ya no me la compran, el prestamo va beneficiar mucho porque me voy apoyar para invertir en otra res y comprar el alimento lo que hago es darle vuelta al dinero para que salgan las ganancias, las metas que tengo es que con mi negocio pueda mejorar mi casa, arreglarla con las cosas que hacen falta y tambien para mis hijos, que tengo 4 estudiando, en total son 6 pero dos ya trabajan, tengo 21 a\u00f1os de casada, la casa es propia y mi esposo es comerciante, el incremento en las ganancias me ayuda porque quiero comprar una lap-top que nesecita mi hijo que va en la preparatoria y haga sus tareas.

Near Marybel's home there is a very large dam and people come there to fish.  Some still come there to wash their clothes.  This is an indigenous community and so these customs still survive.  Marybel's business is fattening cattle.  She requested her loan to buy ground feed to fatten her bulls.  She does not raise cattle but fattens them so that she can sell them a short while later.  She already has customers who buy a cow from her week after week.\r\n\r\n\"One of the challenges I have faced in my business is that feed is becoming more and more expensive and I need quite a lot so that my cattle put on a good amount of weight.  However, I can't increase the price of my cattle any further in order to make this money back because if I do they won't buy from me any more.  The loan will help me a lot because it will help me to invest in another cow and buy feed.  What I do is I use the money so that I can make profits from it.  My goals are to work in my business so that I can improve my home and fix it up with the things that it lacks.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":22382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Bulk purchase of cooking gas;

This resulted in greater sales and profits for her especially with school supplies since the school year was beginning at that time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n <p>This business is a very important part of Rosalia\u2019s household. Although her husband works hard as a door-to-door salesman of goods, Rosalia must rely on her store in order to cover the basic expenses. She works daily from 6AM to 10PM. She has three children who are in school. With Christmas on the way, Rosalia would like to invest in holiday decorations and gifts but she lacks the working capital to do so. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosalia is requesting a second loan so she may purchase those products now while prices are still low.  In this manner, she can offer a decent price to her clients while still making a profit herself. Rosalia\u2019s dream is to make more improvement to her home and provide a better future for her family.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":82497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To invest in Christmas decorations and items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.166667 -79.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-11-11T16:45:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosal\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-26T19:43:04Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2007-12-13T20:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108672},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-01-13T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":114583},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-02-13T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":134240},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-03-13T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":156637},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-04-13T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":181183},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2008-05-02T21:02:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":199249},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2008-05-09T16:53:41Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":205750}],"funded_date":"2007-11-12T19:43:04Z","paid_date":"2008-05-09T16:53:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":27596,"name":"Sakina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"I am a widow with four children: three sons and one daughter.

Abduvali was born on August 03, 1973 in Spitamen district of Sugd region. Coming from an area where cattle-raising is popular, Abduvali has been selling cattle since 1998. He buys them in his village from the farmers who raise them and then sells them at the markets. As his business capital is limited, he buys just a few and then after he sells those, he returns to buy more. Today he would like to expand his business by increasing his capital, so that he can then maximize his profits. For this reason, he is requesting this first loan to purchase young cattle. This will be his first loan with IMON International, and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Eventually, when she got married, she still loved dressmaking and made it into a business.\r\n\r\nAt present, Alice has her dress shop where she offers dressmaking and rents gowns for all occasions. She wishes to expand her dress shop and produce new gowns for rent. She is now working on her loan proposal to HSPFI, a Kiva partner, where she is thinking positively that this amount may be granted to her. From this loan, she is looking forward to more improvement in her business which will eventually reflect in her family\u2019s standard of

G. is a 31-year-old woman who lives with her husband and their 4 daughters: Helen, Yerlin, Angie and Grettel.  They live in a rural community in Costa Rica called Abanico.  It is located in San Isidro de Pe\u00f1as Blancas, San Ram\u00f3n, Alajuela Province.  It is known as a quiet community dedicated to productive activities such as agriculture, livestock and tourism.<p>\r\nMrs. Flor is a member of the ecological group Mujeres el Abanico.  She works sowing Lime Flower, a medicinal plant.  She says a company called Manzat\u00e9 buys her crops as well as those of the other group members.  It\u2019s a national company specialized in producing different herbal teas.<p>\r\nMrs. Flor has worked in lime flower production for more than 10 years.  It has been very profitable for her and her family.  She says she has worked very hard and put a lot of effort into making the project successful.<p>\r\nMrs. Flor says the market demand for this product is very high which is why she would like to increase her lime flower tree plantation and make the drying area larger.  Therefore she needs a loan of \u00a2600.000 (six hundred thousand CRC) to help with preparing the soil and  purchasing seeds and fertilizers, among other supplies which are necessary to guarantee the optimal sowing of the lime flower.  She also hopes to purchase:  wood, plastic, nails, netting, etc.  All these materials are necessary to increase the drying area.<p>\r\nMrs. Flor is part of the Abanico Community Credit Company.  It is one of 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  She has received a micro loan since she is a member.

Marianne borrowed additional capital from ASKI to acquire those products which she sells to her neighbors and friends.

En el futuro quiere terminar de arreglar su casa y tener un local donde pueda vender mariscos. \n","en":"Elsa is 51 years old and sells fish at a stand on the side of the road.  She lives with her three children in an urban area called Guasmo, characterized by the fact that the majority of its inhabitants are merchants.  A year ago, she wanted to independently earn an income so she decided to purchase fish and sell them at a wooden stall on the street.  Little by little, people began to recognize her since she worked from 7:30 to 12, Monday through Friday.  Currently, she sells fish at $2.00\/pound.  One of the inconveniences of selling fish is the dust that comes from the roads, produced from all the traffic.  In order to continue her business and broaden it more, she wants to use this loan to purchase more fish.  In the future, she would like to finish fixing her home and have her own shop where she can sell seafood.    \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":643648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Fish.

She has had her business for almost 16 years, starting to work from her house after a cousin motivated her to buy a hair dryer. She started her beauty salon in her living room; she decided to do it and little by little, she bought everything. She plans to use this loan to invest in her beauty salon by buying hair and cosmetic products. She also wants to buy a professional blower. She will use the profits to reinvest in her business and to save for her daughter's studies.\r\n\r\nHer story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti.

Joreynelle has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Joreynelle joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services. In turn, she has been better able to engage in business activities and to thereby improve her standard of living. Notably, Joreynelle has already successfully repaid two prior loans from GDMPC (i.e., this would be her third loan through GDMPC).

She has more than 11 years of experience. Her customers are people with families, owners of smaller grocery stores, and women who sell corn tortillas. They prefer her because she offers a variety of products. Mrs. Guti\u00e9rrez needs to buy 3 boxes of eggs at $20.00 per box, 1 quintal (100 pounds) of cheese at $80.00 per quintal, 1 drum of cream at $21.00 per drum, 50 pairs of cuajada (a soft, mild-flavored cheese) at $0.80 per pair, 14 pounds of pinolillo mix at $1.00 per pound, 5 100-pound sacks of rice at $35.00 per sack, and 10 100-pound sacks of corn at $11.00 per sack. With this inventory, she will be able to satisfy the demand from her customers, which has increased considerably in the last few months. It is worth noting that in our city people consume large quantities foods that are derived from dairy products, beans, rice, and corn.   Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer.

All the preceding ones have been correctly repaid.  \r\nThe women intend to use this loan to buy a basket of smoked fish, two sacks of flour, four sacks of potatoes and \"atiek\u00e9\" cassava.  They get their supplies of smoked fish in Macina, one of the nearby prefectures from their village;  their market garden produce (potatoes and \"atiek\u00e9\") is from traveling vendors at the marketplaces of Sikasso and of Koutiala;  and as for the flour, it come from the grand marketplace in the city of S\u00e9gou.

She and her husband Eddie, who is 42, and her sons Cristian (8) and Bruce (2) live together in the home of some family members. She wants to provide her sons with a higher quality of life. Sabina owns the earliest-opening grocery store in the Bellavista neighborhood of Juliaca, which she has been running for the past 6 years. At 6am each day she starts attending her clients, and she doesn't stop until 9 or 10pm. She is a very cheerful vendor and always receives her regular clients with a smile on her face. Her favorite part of the job is chatting with her female customers about goings-on in the neighborhood. Her least favorite part of the job is being stuck inside her store all day, unable to leave to go outside or do other things. Sabina hopes that her store will grow in the future and become the main store in the neighborhood. This is her fifth loan from Microfinanzas Prisma, and she is sure that she will be able to pay all of her loan installments on time. She is one of the most cheerful, responsible members of her village bank. With this requested loan of 1000 soles, she will purchase more products in order to increase the amount of merchandise she offers for sale at her store. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":352415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy more merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-15T21:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":133.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63212009},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":133.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641544},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:23Z","rounded_local_amount":133.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080984},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:07:40Z","rounded_local_amount":133.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997123},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":133.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842477},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":399.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734050}],"funded_date":"2009-07-16T20:57:10Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":125939,"name":"Geraldine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geraldine I\u00f1esa, 32, is one of CCT\u2019s youngest successful entrepreneurs.

She is now 37 years old while her husband is 40 years old and works as a carpenter in their place. They have 3 children namely: John Mark at the age of 18 working as a welder, Merlendeth 16 years old and currently studying as first year college and Arisa Mae now grade 2 in the age of 7 years old. Though her husband work hard for them, the daily income that she get is not enough for their big expenses, it only support their daily needs in the house, but it can\u2019t support the other expenses of the family like the education of her two other children, because now a days it cost much to studied in college. So Maricel thinks of another business that can contributes to their daily income aside from the revenue of her husband and her sewing business, it comes out the buy and sell of banana. She decided to start up this business because in their place banana is common and not cost much.\n\nThe loan that she received from Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) will be use for buying different kinds of banana for selling. Because more banana to sell more income for their family. They do this business for one year now and she is right that this business will grow if you are interested in doing it.\n\nMaricel really hopes that through all her business they will reach the things that they dream like to have a comfortable house for them and a good education for her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":401536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

To help her husband in providing for their family,Julieta runs a fishing business. She decided to start this business because all the resources are since they live in an island village of Sapang in the Philippines, and also because she wants to save for the future of her children.<P>\r\n\r\nBoth loans that she has received form Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) when she became a member has been used in improving this business. Now, her 3rd loan will be used in buying all the materials for making a fish cage, because their fish cage was damaged during Typhoon Ondoy. She will buy bamboo, fishnets and accessories for fishnets, different fingerlings (small fish) and also gasoline for the boat. She is hoping that with the help of this loan she can rebuild the fish cage that has been damaged and through its revenue they can add another fish cage for more income for them.<P>\r\n\r\nAs a mother, her first priority in life is their children; she wants them to finish their studies until college. Through their hard work and with help from others like ASHI and Kiva lenders, Julieta knows she can do

He is 27, married, and the father of 4 children.  His chidren are 4, 3, 2, and 1, so they still aren't of school age.  Elvisse never went to school.  He lives in his own home in Boane with his family and supports 4 more people who live in his house as well.  He left Chibuto for Maputo during the war as a way to find refuge.  He ended up staying in Boane until now.  He has had his own business for more than 15 years, where he works along with his wife from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m.  He learned this work in South Africa when he was employed in a store.  He sells alcoholic beverages and makes an income of around 1,000 meticais per day.  He puts away savings every month in his account in the Millennium Bim bank.  He has never had a loan with another credit institution.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through his mother-in-law, who is also a client with this institution.  This is his third loan, and it is in the amount of 20,000 meticais.  He will use it to acquire products for his business (beer, wine, soft drinks, and basic goods) as a way to respond to his customers' demands.  His previous loans were for 6,500 and 15,000 meticais, both for the same purpose.  He has a goal of increasing his merchandise so he can consequently increase his income.  In the future, he would like to request more loans to construct his house and to furnish it. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

Zaffarjon is a very courageous man who can manage tough jobs like raising cattle and agriculture. He is the father of three children, and has the responsibility of supporting his family and providing them with everything that they need. In spite of his difficult economic situation, and after much time, Zaffarjon has been able to get ahead in his business by purchasing cattle which he breeds on his property. His greatest goal nowadays is to improve his economic situation and provide a better way of life for his family. It is for this reason that Zaffarjon has come to IMON International for a loan to purchase more animals for breeding.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history.  It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Felipe, a tricycle driver, and mother to their children. By the grace of God, Dolores has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send them all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Dolores, as she herself is a college graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nDolores operates a charcoal retailing business along with her buying and selling of tropical fruits. She also oversees the tricycle transport business. In the Philippines, many still use the old ways of cooking (on an earthen stove where charcoal is used) to save money. Charcoal is much cheaper than LPG fuel, which, in the current market, costs as much as Php600.   Many people prefer to buy charcoal, which is so cheap that it can be bought for Php5. More people are also switching to firewood, which can be foraged or found in the trash.  Dolores also sells tropical fruits on her stall because they are usually requested by her customers.  Among these three businesses, she earns an estimated net income of around Php9,000 monthly.\r\n \r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of charcoal in sacks to be repackaged and retailed to her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nDolores hopes to be able to see her business mature and grow. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":714501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more quantities of charcoal in sacks to be repackaged, and also varieties of tropical fruits to add to her current inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-17T22:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2181.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814262},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2908.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256827},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2908.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123520},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2908.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194818}],"funded_date":"2011-02-17T23:23:47Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":278396,"name":"Somreang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Somreang S. is a widow with seven children - five sons and two daughters.

in 1960 in Anfoin-Kpodji, Mr. Agossou K. raises livestock.  He is married and the father of three children.  Having a good business sense, he realized there is a terrible dearth of feed in the area.  And so he has an idea that would further his livestock business.  But his new business venture requires substantial capital that he does not have.  He has however an excellent credit history with a previous $550 loan that he repaid without a problem.   \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nGiven the ever-increasing demands that he has not been able to meet, Mr. K. is requesting a loan of $1,200 to stockpile enough feed in case of shortages.  The success of his plan will expand his business and increase his income considerably.  He could then better support his family.  \r\n \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nN\u00e9 en 1960 Anfoin-Kpodji, Monsieur K.

Misamis Occidental. She is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Salvacion B.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\n<p>Salvacion is married to Fausto B., a farmer and her business assistant. They were blessed with 2 children who are now adults with their own families. Five years ago, Salvacion decided to help her husband and became involved in the food-selling business, specializing in \"puso\", or hanging rice, and native vinegar.  She has been able to maintain the business and now earns an average net monthly income of not less than 3,000 PHP, which is so helpful to their family income. \r\n\r\n<p>Upon hearing the good news of PAGLAUM MPC being one of the most outstanding cooperatives in Northern Mindanao and being awarded Most Outstanding Cooperative in the Philippines during the search for the COOP-LGU Partnership Award 2006,  Salvacion  joined the cooperative in 2009. As an active member of PAGLAUM MPC's PDP-LP Program, a microfinance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she is requesting a loan of 3,000 PHP (her 3rd cycle loan) to be used for additional capital for her business. The future income from this loan will be used to improve her family's living conditions, to meet their basic needs, as loan repayments to PMPC and for possible business expansions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":556404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Additional
