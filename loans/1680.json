He is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in his village because of his resilience despite personal challenges and his passion to support his children as a primary caregiver. The living conditions in the Kerugoya area are very tough and you need to have tough skin in order to survive. Dickson has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. \r\n\r\nBecause of the hardcore poverty in his village, Dickson started practicing mixed farming 10 years ago. His sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg sales. However, these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market. The Kerugoya area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Dickson is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike, he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. \r\n\r\nDickson is very determined to succeed. Because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans that he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and for his grandchildren through accumulated profits. Dickson's dream is to provide a secure future for his grandchildren by paying tuition fees for them.

to be professionals. That is what fills Hassan with enthusiasm and inspiration. Hassan is 28 years old and works tirelessly to raise animals. Through these humble tasks, he aspires to offer all of his children a university education. Hassan learned to do farm work at a young age, thanks to his parents. He has a tiny plot of land \u2013 just under half an acre \u2013  to farm and has always struggled to support his family. Hassan has developed the farm in the sloping undulating terrain by successfully adopting soil and water conservation methods. For over five years, his income source has been from selling milk, poultry, and vegetables. He supplements the meager income by doing other personal business. Hassan passionately loves dairy farming. Milking and feeding his own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. He is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in his village. Milk, poultry and vegetables are very perishable, and these products require timely delivery to the market. One problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. The Nyamira area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. That is why Hassan is kindly seeking a loan to buy another motorbike. Farmers like Hassan will use the motorbike to transport passengers and farm goods to and from the market. They are suited for areas with poor road networks  inaccessible by cars. They are also very cheap to acquire and maintain. Invest in Hassan\u2019s future and you won't regret it. He is full of promise. So far, he has managed to send his children to standard private schools with his hard work."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":293.99,"image":{"id":1811768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy another motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-09T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-11T23:30:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.56,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hassan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.81,"local_amount":6561.15,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6733.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265124},{"amount":68.92,"local_amount":6126.18,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6287.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459773},{"amount":71.37,"local_amount":6466.38,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6636.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.38,"payment_id":696587856},{"amount":76.33,"local_amount":6978.72,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":7162.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.18,"payment_id":731022977}],"funded_date":"2015-03-10T16:43:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":837562,"name":"Lisambra Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo solidario est\u00e1 conformado por tres mujeres (Noemy Jovielka, Solmari y Cristina) de la etnia miskita de la comunidad de Lamlaya, que en lengua miskita significa agua mansa, del municipio de Puerto Cabezas.

Benjamin is a very hardworking man who enjoys farming, which he has been doing on his small piece of land for the past 13 years. Through all those years, he has gained much experience and is one of the most respected farmers in his village. Because of the immense knowledge that he has in farming, Benjamin offers extension services to other farmers who are new to the business. Being a caring and loving father, Benjamin has been able to take care of his family and support them by the profits he has earned from farming. Although he reaps much profit, one challenge that he is facing that is dragging him down and preventing him being more successful is lack of enough land to farm. For this reason, he is seeking a loan of KES 70,000 to buy a piece of land and expand his farming activities. Having so much experience in farming, Benjamin is sure that he will make good use of the land and double his profit. This will allow him to repay the loan, improve his living conditions, and realize his dream of having a good quality life and securing his children's future.

Rosa ahora ya como microempresaria a podido dar trabajo a una se\u00f1ora ya que sola no alcanza con tanto trabajo, su negocio tiene buena clientela por la clase de trabajos que ella realiza. \n Rosa acude por primera vez a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y se siente muy feliz porque con este cr\u00e9dito ella podr\u00e1 invertir en materia prima para la elaboraci\u00f3n de uniformes escolares ya que se acerca la temporada de alta demanda porque en estos meses est\u00e1 por iniciar el a\u00f1o escolar.\nAgradece a todos quienes forman Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y en especial a Kiva porque con los cr\u00e9ditos entregados ayudan a muchas personas que necesitan prosperar en sus peque\u00f1as empresas.","en":"Santo Domingo de los Colorados is a city on the coast which is known in Ecuador for being a productive and commercial zone.  Precisely in that city there is a lot of commercial trade, as it is the ground port linking the mountains and the coast.  This is where Rosa lives.  She is a 44-year old woman who has two children.  Both little ones go to school. \r\n<p>\r\nRosa says that she started her business 24 years ago with three sewing machines.  She is happy because she has always liked her profession, and thanks to her work, she has been able to get ahead and give her children an education.  Now that she is a micro-entrepreneur, Rosa has been able to employ another woman, as she can't get all the work done herself.  Rosa's business has a good clientele because of the quality of work she turns out. \r\n<p>\r\nRosa has come to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for the first time.  She feels happy because, with the loan, she will be able to invest in raw materials for making school uniforms.  The season of high demand is nearing, as these months are the beginning of the school year.  \r\n<p>\r\nRosa is grateful to all of those who make up Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and especially to Kiva.  The loans they grant help many people who need to prosper in their small businesses.

The biogas will be connected directly to the cookstove and boiler in his house, allowing the household to displace the expensive LP gas and the wood they used to cook with. The wood was producing toxic smoke the family was inhaling on a daily basis, and its elimination will lead to important health benefits.

Maria and her family feel very lucky to live in a place full of traditions and culture. \r\nMaria is 44 years old, she is very hard-working, kind, and smiles a lot. She is married to Brasilio, and together they have formed a family with six children, of which only three still depend on them, and only two go to elementary school.\r\nMaria was an enemy of debts, but her neighbors encouraged her to take out her first loan. \u201cI remember it was a very small amount, I did not like having to owe money.\u201d But that small amount of capital helped her to start the breed and fattening of sheep, and the loans stopped being something unknown, and they were also a source of support to keep increasing the number of her animals. \r\nAfterwards, she and her partners in the group decided to look for a better loan option, and found VisionFund Mexico. By then, Maria was realizing that she had to spend more and more time with her sheep and was distancing herself from her family, so she decided to start selling clothing.\r\nShe has been selling clothing for eight years now, in the same community and in others. Every Monday she travels to the capital to purchase merchandise at wholesale, and she has already more than 40 loyal clients who always make special orders. Maria remembers that when she started working, she spent the days walking through the streets. Now the business has grown, and with the income she was able to buy a vehicle with which she transports all the clothing. With the goal of incentivizing her sales, Maria allows her clients to pay for the garments in payments, although there are times when it gets complicated, but she does not get discouraged. \u201cIn some way, I have to take a risk to be able to get more clients.\u201d\r\nShe and her family are very grateful to VisionFund and Kiva, because now they can purchase more clothing with the new loan she is asking for, and because it has brought great benefits. Her house has improved, and when her husband is unemployed, she can settle the expenses of her children.\r\n\u201cI would like to have more stable clients to be able to help my daughter who is studying. She really wants to fulfill herself professionally, I would not like that she could not achieve her dream because of a lack of economic income\u201d says Maria, when expressing her biggest dream.

To provide a source of income for her family, she became involved in animal husbandry in 2000.  She started with a capital of 13,000 som (KGS) and now makes a monthly income of about 20,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and dairy products.  She has one dairy cow and three young bulls on her farm.  In order to further grow her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 150,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy two dairy cows with their calves, which will help her to produce and sell higher volumes of organic milk.

He hasn't completed his higher education yet.  He actually transferred to distance learning because he has to help his parents to make a living and to pay for his own education.  Sanjar is very hardworking.  He provides video-recording services to the local residents during weddings. This year, he wants to help his parents to renovate their house.  He will contribute by paying for the installation of new windows and doors.  In spite of his young age, he has already taken a loan, which he was able to pay off by himself before the repayment term.  Sanjar is thankful for MDO Arvand's support and

She is married to James Manuel, an OFW, and has two children of which one is in high school and one is in elementary school. She works hard to meet their daily household needs, and for the schooling of her children. \r\n\r\nPia Jane is in a food business; she has operated an eatery stall for a number of years already. In the Philippines, a food stall is a common sight, especially in populated areas. Working class people usually buy their meals at food stalls.  The food is sold at a reasonable price for convenience, and to save money, rather than cooking at home. The working class just eat their home-cooked meals at the end of the day with their family. She cooks well; that is why her food stall is popular in their area, with neighbors and the local working community as her regular customers.  She earns a minimum of Php1,000 net income a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her maintain her business, Pia Jane is requesting a Php25,000 loan to buy additional raw ingredients like pork, fish, chicken and seasonings that are needed for her cooking. She believes that with this financial assistance, her sales and earnings will increase.  She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial aid that will be extended to her, for it will be a great help in their daily sustenance and for the school needs of her children.\r\n\r\nPia Jane dreams to put up a small eatery to attract more customers. She aims to send her children to college to allow them better opportunities in life.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

has no children. She has a high school education. In search of an additional source of income for her family, she started raising livestock and planting crops, at first with help from her parents, and now on her own. Thanks to her hard work she currently has one cow and a 0.54 hectare plot of land where she grows potatoes to sell. She also has a greenhouse where she grows tomatoes and cabbage. She earns 6,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to further develop her farm, Sharifahon applied for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy seed potatoes and fertilizers for the soil. She plans to use the profits to continue investing in her farm. She wants to save money to build a barn for livestock.

Meet Asmani, one of Ruma's agents. He joined Ruma a year ago. Asmani lives in Cilegon, located about two hours from Jakarta, the capital city. Right now, he is still a student in a university near the place where he lives. \r\n\r\nHe decided to join Ruma because he wants to learn about how to manage a business. He feels happy because since he joined Ruma, he has learned how to improve his business. He feels that he can make a good contribution to his community through his small business as well. \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Asmani needs to get a working capital loan from Kiva.

Dairy farming is close to her heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow, and that makes her very proud. Although Phares makes profits through selling milk, she is faced with the problem of feeding her cow. She is requesting a loan to buy a chaff cutter. A chaff cutter is a mechanical device used to cut hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forages. With the loan, her cows will not reject any part of the food, hence increasing milk production and Phares's income level.

in school. He has been running a butcher shop for two years now. He works from 5am to 8.30pm daily and is able to make a good monthly profit.\r\n\r\nThis will be Nollascor's second loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. He used his previous loan to increase stock of cow's meat, to start selling, and to buy a freezer. He has paid back his loan successfully.

Olga y Ad\u00e1n son hijos de Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Casimira y Mar\u00eda Mercedes es su nuera. Todos viven en una comunidad mazahua y se apoyan incondicionalmente ante cualquier situaci\u00f3n. En el lugar donde habitan, la mayor parte de la poblaci\u00f3n se dedica al cultivo de ma\u00edz y a la ganader\u00eda.\n\nDo\u00f1a Casimira tiene 44 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada desde hace 30 con el se\u00f1or Irineo quien trabaja como alba\u00f1il y formaron una familia de 8 hijos, 2 de los cuales a\u00fan dependen de ellos y se encuentran estudiando.\n\nDesde hace 5 a\u00f1os, Casimira se dedica a la cr\u00eda y engorda de borregos; aunque durante 20 a\u00f1os cri\u00f3 becerros pero la inversi\u00f3n en alimento era mayor adem\u00e1s del peligro por el tama\u00f1o de los animales. \"Comenc\u00e9 la actividad porque mis hijos eran muy peque\u00f1os y yo no pod\u00eda salir a trabajar, no quer\u00eda descuidarlos\". Ella necesita apoyo econ\u00f3mico para comprar 5 borregos m\u00e1s, un poco de alimento, pasto y vitaminas. Muy emocionada Do\u00f1a Casimira coment\u00f3 que prefiere los borregos porque son fuertes y crecen muy r\u00e1pido, en tan s\u00f3lo seis meses ella obtiene muy buenas ganancias.\n\nEn un d\u00eda cotidiano, Casimira se levanta desde muy temprano para dar pastura y agua a los animales mientras ella se dedica al quehacer de su casa. Ya por la tarde regresa nuevamente con los borregos para sacarlos a pasear y alimentarlos una vez m\u00e1s. Los borregos los adquiere en la misma comunidad y cuando han alcanzado el tama\u00f1o y precio adecuados los vende a las personas que se dedican a preparar la tradicional barbacoa. El gran sue\u00f1o de Mar\u00eda Mercedes es que su hijos se realicen profesionalmente aunque tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda hacer algunas remodelaciones a su hogar. \n\nCasimira y el resto del grupo est\u00e1n muy agradecidos con la oportunidad de recibir un pr\u00e9stamo porque ahora tienen un negocio propio que les ayuda a solventar sus gastos y a buscar una mejor calidad de vida. Adan, Olga y Maria Mercedes tambi\u00e9n invertir\u00e1n en borreguitos.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el municipio, Do\u00f1a Casimira es quien viste el mandil morado*","en":"The \u201cFamilia MP\u201d group is made up of members from the same family. Olga and Ad\u00e1n are Mar\u00eda Casimira\u2019s children; Mar\u00eda Mercedes is her daughter-in-law. The family lives in a Mazahua community and everyone supports each other unconditionally in whatever situation. The majority of people in the community here work growing corn and in cattle-raising.\n\nCasimira is 44 years old and has been married to Irineo for 30 years. Irineo works as a builder and together the couple has eight children, two of whom are still dependents and in school.\n\nFor five years Casimira has made a living raising and fattening up lambs. For 20 years she had raised calves but the cost of feed was higher and the work was more dangerous given the size of the animals.\n\n\u201cI started this work because my children were very young and I could no longer go out to work. I didn\u2019t want to neglect them,\u201d Casimira says. \n\nCasimira needs financial support in order to buy five more lambs, plus some food, grass and vitamins. Casimira says excitedly that she prefers working with lambs are they are strong and grow very quickly. In just six months she was able to earn very good profits.\n\nOn a typical day, Casimira wakes up very early to graze her animals and give them water. At the same time, she takes care of the household chores. In the afternoon Casimira returns home to take the lambs out for a walk and to feed them again. Casimira buys the lambs in her local area. Once they have reached the right size and value, she sells them to people who prepare traditional barbeque meat. Casimira\u2019s big dream is for her children to have a profession. She would also like to make improvements to her house.\n\nCasimira and the rest of the group are very grateful for this loan opportunity as they now have their own businesses to help them cover their personal costs and can work to enjoy a higher quality of life. \n\nAd\u00e1n, Olga and Mercedes will also invest in lambs.\n\n*The photograph was taken in the municipality.

to progress. However, Richard is a man who never gives up despite the weather or situations that happen. He always manages to meet the requirements of his family.\n\nHe gets up very early in the morning to go to his farm where he works. He owns a small piece of land together with his lovely wife. They have been blessed with adorable children. On the land, they have kept dairy cattle and grown vegetables for 5 years. Their main income sources are milk and crops. They recently ventured into a small personal business to supplement the meager income they earn.  From Kiva lenders, Richard is seeking a loan of 50,000 KES to grow his horticultural business.Loans to smallholder farmers in Kenya are hard to get and It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to afford Richard access to a loan facility that will help him to grow his horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With this loan, Richard\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business.

With a loan of $300, she hopes to improve her business and thereby improving the standard of living for her children.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1811757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To expand her tailoring business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-02-10T23:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-12T23:50:10Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patience","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":283.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":283.33,"local_amount":283.33,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:23:27Z","rounded_local_amount":283.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636477646},{"amount":283.33,"local_amount":283.33,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":283.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649745760},{"amount":283.33,"local_amount":283.33,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":283.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665235522},{"amount":283.33,"local_amount":283.33,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":283.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681541914},{"amount":283.68,"local_amount":283.68,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":283.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696747172},{"amount":283,"local_amount":283,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:00:26Z","rounded_local_amount":283,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711678858}],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T01:36:25Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T19:00:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":837913,"name":"Kugarika Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tsitsi is a member of Kugarika group, based in Crowborough high density suburb.

The next season is when school classes begin, and he will focus on selling school backpacks. He does this work all day from Monday to Sunday. His business has steady sales, because it is close to the central area.
