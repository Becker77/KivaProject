She has three children under her care who are 14, 16, and 10 years of age, all of whom are in school. She is originally from Managua, a place located in the central zone of the country. She can be characterized as being hardworking, responsible, with an attitude toward personal improvement. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately she was not able to go to school and had to work from a young age from necessity in order to help with expenses in the home. Now she struggles day to day to provide her children with a better quality of life, as her dream is to see them become professionals. \r\n\r\nThanks to her desire to get ahead, as an economic activity she works in the sale of beef and cow in a specific part of a local market. She has spent 25 years in this business, which she started by her own initiative and the need to have a means of subsistence for her children. The aim of the loan is to invest it in her products and buy a variety of meats to satisfy demand from her customers. Modesta appreciates the help that the investors of Kiva provide to people with few resources and poor countries like Nicaragua to have a means of respectable work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":787.5,"image":{"id":1812723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy different types of meat such as: beef, pork, liver, entrails, roast beef, tenderloin, eye of round, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2015-02-11T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-13T03:40:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modesta Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":177.35,"local_amount":4729.42,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4743.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636632164},{"amount":85.26,"local_amount":2273.56,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-18T11:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2280.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649612417},{"amount":42.28,"local_amount":1127.44,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1130.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666521559},{"amount":150.59,"local_amount":4015.79,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:06:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4027.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681390038},{"amount":87.51,"local_amount":2333.6,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:00:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2340.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696600379},{"amount":138.09,"local_amount":3682.35,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-24T12:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3693.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":733233623},{"amount":106.42,"local_amount":2837.81,"processed_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2846.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752310022}],"funded_date":"2015-03-12T03:28:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Verna Krishnamurthy","image":1691630}},{"id":838307,"name":"Catherine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Catherine is 40 years old, married and has a child.

Taliko doesn't have her own job and has a great desire to do her bit for the family's welfare. She requested a loan from local financial institutions several times to start a trading business but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because the creditors did not find the existing family income or experience to be sufficient to approve the loan.  \r\n\r\nTaliko requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start up loan program provides start up credit on soft conditions to people, who are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, and do not have access to credit products. With the received credit, Taliko will go to Turkey where is located the worldwide market  and purchase stock of various bed linens to start trading. This new business initiative, financed with a Kiva startup loan, will significantly increase her family's income and the family members will be able to improve their living

They live in a rented house made of brick with a roof made of corrugated iron.

children who are now independent.  Maliyka has a secondary education and she has been working as a seamstress for more than 10 years already.  Her shop is located on her property.

He wants to buy new instruments, but his financial condition does not allow him to do so.\r\n \r\nDue to her husband's low purchasing power, Razia requested a loan so that her husband can become empowered and easily buy new instruments, such as scissors, combs, a shaving machine, front mirror and revolving chair.\r\n\r\nRazia hopes that this loan will work positively and she would be able to make some savings for household expenses.

time to make money to provide financial support for her family. Though her responsibilities are critical to her family\u2019s well-being, this is considered a mere duty in Kenya, a job with little appreciation. \r\n\r\nBeatrice's husband manages their small farm, making $100 per year. Even though his small income keeps the family living in poverty, he still claims the position of breadwinner in the household, as is the case in most households in Kenya. Financial support far outweighs any other care or support for the family, leaving women disadvantaged to make decisions within the household, and forces them to fully depend on their husbands to buy everything, from laundry soap to the food they eat. \r\n\r\nWith the little time Beatrice has, she sells crops from their small farm and also keeps dairy cows and poultry. From Kiva lenders, Beatrice is seeking a loan worth 30,000 KES to grow her horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. \r\n\r\nWhile experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to give Beatrice access to a loan that will aid her in growing her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increasing employment opportunities, and bringing about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Beatrice\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":219.66,"image":{"id":1812503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to grow her horticulture farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-11T14:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-13T14:10:12Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.24,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.77,"local_amount":2123.19,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2267.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265128},{"amount":26.45,"local_amount":2266.83,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2420.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601278},{"amount":25.1,"local_amount":2151.76,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2297.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459777},{"amount":27.54,"local_amount":2382.99,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2544.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.26,"payment_id":681378172},{"amount":27.6,"local_amount":2404.6,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2567.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.45,"payment_id":696587861},{"amount":26.75,"local_amount":2399.79,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2562.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.25,"payment_id":711506151},{"amount":29.27,"local_amount":2572.04,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2746.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.74,"payment_id":731022980},{"amount":28.94,"local_amount":2527.02,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2698.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.54,"payment_id":752111145}],"funded_date":"2015-02-11T14:16:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":838375,"name":"Marianna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marianna is 28 years old and she lives in Kapan city in Syunik region.

She is married and has four children: two daughters and two sons. Her husband is a farmer. Guldasta is a hardworking and responsible woman. She raises livestock and has a barn where she takes care of the animals. She has been in this business for six years. Guldasta also plants crops in her free time and helps her husband with his work.

Filipinos are more practical in their buying habits; they go to dealers for convenience and economics. Her income from her store is a stable source with which to sustain her family's basic needs and support the education of her only child. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her, for it will surely help fund their every day needs and the schooling of her child. \r\n\r\nMarjorie Joyce dreams of having her own boutique to attract more customers. She aims to give her child the best education to allow her better opportunities in life. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies.\r\n\r\n*All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1702906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise items, orders of shoes and ready-to-wear clothes to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-02-11T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-13T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marjorie Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":153.36,"local_amount":6666.68,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:48Z","rounded_local_amount":6800.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200727},{"amount":191.66,"local_amount":8333.35,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":8500.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187008},{"amount":153.32,"local_amount":6666.68,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6800.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536036},{"amount":76.66,"local_amount":3333.29,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3400.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017252}],"funded_date":"2015-02-11T18:29:05Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":838445,"name":"Ma.

Profits from milk sales have enabled her to take care of her family, and she wants her cows to produce more milk. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy animal feed. With this animal feed, her cows will be able to increase milk production, which will translate to increased income.

However, her biggest challenge today is limited funds to expand her business. \r\n\r\nJoy is seeking a loan of 60,000 KES from Kiva's lenders, via Juhudi Kilimo, in order to purchase goats of a good quality breed. \r\n\r\nFuture proceeds from the commercialization of Joy's goat farm are already committed to pay for her child\u2019s education.

To be young and starting a new family with a fragment of land is a challenge for people in the Nkubu area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nRose, a mother of two, has overcome this challenge and has been practicing mixed farming for the past seven years. Her primary source of income has been both selling eggs, maize, and milk, as well as some personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. \r\n\r\nRose, who is an ever-smiling farmer, has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans that farming is for the older generation. She passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early-riser, and she wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cow. \r\n\r\nAlthough this humble mom has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, Rose is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. \r\n\r\nRose is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy customer demand. With her loan she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 litres of milk a day. This will help fully satisfy demand. \r\n\r\nThrough Kiva's field partner Juhudi Kilimo, Rose attended training sessions and was taught the best financial management skills. This will help her save more money to repay the loan fully and to improve her living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450.94,"image":{"id":1812614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-11T17:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-13T17:30:08Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.68,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.12,"local_amount":9699.95,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:31Z","rounded_local_amount":9987.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265132},{"amount":113.71,"local_amount":10107.46,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:39Z","rounded_local_amount":10406.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459782},{"amount":107.84,"local_amount":9740.96,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10029.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.75,"payment_id":696587865},{"amount":115.59,"local_amount":10534.84,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:04Z","rounded_local_amount":10846.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.93,"payment_id":731022985}],"funded_date":"2015-02-17T20:44:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nathan Tichenor","image":28733}},{"id":838438,"name":"Lang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lang, 57, lives in a small house in Ho Chi Minh City with her family, including a daughter and her husband.

She is happily married, and together with her husband is blessed with four lovely children.\r\n\r\nFor the past 29 years, she has been practicing mixed farming, and because of the experience she has, she commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers and is regarded as a mentor. Income from selling milk, a motorcycle business, eggs, and maize has allowed her to earn a decent income. Faith passionately loves dairy farming, and animals on her farm have been given names such as \u201cKairu\u201d (Black). Milking and feeding Kairu (the name of her cow) makes her very proud.\r\n\r\nBy selling milk, she has had good returns, and the demand for milk has been expanding. Through extensive use of her mobile phone, she receives orders from customers and then sends her customers a text message when the milk is ready for collection. Demand has been overwhelming, and she needs an extra breed of cow to satisfy fully the demand.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy a quality dairy cow and also animal feeds. Faith does not intend to buy just an ordinary cow; she wants to buy a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce rich, creamy milk. The dairy cow will produce between 15-20 liters of milk a day and the animal feed will help the cow to produce even more and more milk. The increased milk production will translate into more income, and Faith will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children going to school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":509.18,"image":{"id":1812619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Marjory approached Thrive so as to grow her business which was becoming stagnant due to lack of working capital. Her main challenge was raising enough working capital to complement her hard work. \n\nMajury is grateful for the training and financial assistance she received from Thrive. Her business has generated profits which have not only made her business grow; they have also gone a long way in improving her family\u2019s quality of life. Hardworking Majury, even though faced by a spinal illness and operation, did not let her business crumble. Majury and her family were faced with crippling medical bills, however she did not let that deter her. After her operation made it hard for her to travel, Majury has since diversified into operating a groceries stall which is thriving. Her future plans are to open a supermarket and venture into the furniture business.

Already, she has earned significant revenue, attracted over forty vendors in the US and Europe, and gained hundreds of customers. However, she is not experiencing steady growth, and the company suffers from insufficient publicity.\r\n\r\nThis loan will allow Kelechi to find more vendors and expand her marketing channels. Specifically, she wishes to expand her vendor and customer reach to include countries in Africa. By supporting her, lenders are also supporting scores of small business owners who sell their products on Kelechi\u2019s website, as well as their communities. Many of the craftspeople she works with are women, whose talent is broadcast through Kelechi\u2019s business. \r\n\r\nKelechi believes that the beauty and uniqueness of African textiles and clothing \u201cis a beauty I want the rest of the world to see as well. I want to change the perceptions of the African continent through fashion and design.

He currently instructs adults, teens, and children, gaining much of his satisfaction from helping young children become more focused. He has no employees, but his wife and other young teens serve as volunteers from time to time.\r\n\r\nIn order to financially support his family, Gerald works as a full time college custodian. However, he wants to become a full-time martial arts teacher and grow his school substantially. The purpose of his loan is to purchase a new uniform and more equipment for his students at his martial arts academy.

area of Kenya, an area that is near the famous Mount Kenya. She is 42 years of age and has been doing farming for the past 22 years and through those years, she has gathered so much experience she is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming and her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some small businesses that she does so that she can make ends meet. Mary is very passionate about farming and she loves cultivating her farm. That is why everyday she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. <br \/><br \/>Although Mary makes profits through farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy cereals. The Chuka area is one of the regions that is populated and has a high demand for cereals. That means that Mary will make more profits and be able to satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Mary, but she feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. <br \/><br \/>Mary believes that this loan will be of much help and she will be able to satisfy the demand that is there for cereals. She believes that the extra income will allow permanent change to her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Mary to repay the loan and secure the future of her school going children"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1812655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-11T20:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-13T20:40:10Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.62,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.14,"local_amount":1434.98,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1477.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265138},{"amount":15.58,"local_amount":1385.1,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1426.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601285},{"amount":17.42,"local_amount":1548.12,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1593.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459787},{"amount":17.71,"local_amount":1588.85,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1635.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.16,"payment_id":681378180},{"amount":16.84,"local_amount":1521.19,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1566.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.27,"payment_id":696587869},{"amount":17.85,"local_amount":1659.71,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1708.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.83,"payment_id":711506158},{"amount":18.91,"local_amount":1723.59,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1774.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.48,"payment_id":731022990},{"amount":100.93,"local_amount":9138.46,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:14Z","rounded_local_amount":9409.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.88,"payment_id":752111152}],"funded_date":"2015-02-13T18:20:01Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":838638,"name":"Jessie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jessie is a married woman with eight children.

Other members of the group are embroiderers and seamstresses.<br \/><br \/>Like all of the Friendship Bridge Trust Banks, \u201cLos Tulipanes\u201d is run by a board of directors consisting of a president, secretary and treasurer. Forty-year-old Karla is the president and has been a microentrepreneur through catalog sales of cosmetics and shoes. Last year, because of increased competition, she began a business selling snacks, which produces a better income.  This year for her new business, she is requesting a loan to buy pots, pitchers, cups and dishes as well as ingredients to make tostadas, enchiladas, chuchitos and porridges that her customers want. With her increased income, Karla can support her twin daughters' education through to the university level. Karla has a secretarial diploma but has never been able to find any jobs. That is why she continues to grow her businesses and is asking for a loan so that her daughters can become strong women with better opportunities. <br \/><br \/>All the women of the Trust Bank \u201cLos Tulipanes\u201d are extremely grateful to the Kiva investors for providing the loans that make it possible for them to increase and\/or maintain their businesses.

The purpose of the loan is to buy more coffee for trade so that he can raise money to maintain his family, pay school fees for his children and develop himself. Stephen is an honest and hardworking man but is always affected by limited capital. He faces many challenges like fluctuation of prices and competition from other traders. However, his major problem is limited capital which hinders him from buying all the coffee his customers want.

For these reasons, Paulina is seeking a loan to purchase wool from lambs, llamas and alpacas, in order to expand her offerings and support her children in their studies.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan cycle with the institution in her 18 years in business.

From these results, Ni Nengah paid off the loan to MUK of 1,500,000 IDR and then she and the group of Wiguna Merta proposed for a new loan to MUK. These loans are very necessary to increase business capital for pigs and farming, so they can supplement the family income.\r\n\r\nHer only daily activities are as a farmer with her husband. Ni Nengah and some friends formed a group for pigs that has been running for 10 periods. With the help of venture capital loans from MUK of 1,500,000 IDR per member, Ni Nengah developed the pigs group of Wiguna Merta and she became its head.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Ni Nengah will use this loan to buy three local piglets for fattening, each 500,000 IDR. Ni Nengah will buy feed and corn seeds for the garden with her own money. She hopes for next six months the pigs will have a good growth, which will increase sales results.

Mientras \u00e9l trabajaba en la construcci\u00f3n de casas, a Do\u00f1a Gilberta se le ocurri\u00f3 iniciar con la cr\u00eda de animales para despu\u00e9s venderlos y as\u00ed ayudar con los gastos del hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos, ya que para Don Rosendo era complicado poder cubrir todos los gastos.\n\nDo\u00f1a Gilberta adquiri\u00f3 experiencia al lado de su madre cuando era peque\u00f1a y ya cuenta con 35 a\u00f1os de experiencia en el cuidado de pollos, pavos, borregos, cerdos y becerros. Desde muy temprano, se levanta para atender a su familia y despu\u00e9s a sus animales, siempre ha aprovechado el campo que tiene en su comunidad para alimentar a los animales. Sin embargo, los cerdos son los animales m\u00e1s dedicados y para ellos necesita comprar alimento especial, que es en lo que necesita invertir actualmente. Gracias a los pr\u00e9stamos de VisionFund sus animales han crecido favorablemente por lo que se siente agradecida. \n\nCon las ganancias de su negocio, ahora Gilberta puede comprar con mayor facilidad alimentos, zapatos y material para la escuela de sus hijos. Tambi\u00e9n logr\u00f3 arreglar dos habitaciones en su casa y est\u00e1 a punto de construir dos m\u00e1s. Ahora, para Rosendo es mucho m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil solventar sus gastos y se siente apoyado por su mujer, sobre todo cuando no est\u00e1 trabajando en alg\u00fan proyecto. \n\nUno de los sue\u00f1os de gilberta es poder seguir apoyando a su hija que est\u00e1 estudiando su educaci\u00f3n secundaria. \u201cMe gustar\u00eda que mi ni\u00f1a pudiera estudiar una carrera profesional para tener un empleo mejor pagado y pueda tener una mejor calidad de vida\u201d.\n\nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Feliza y Lucina quienes invertir\u00e1n en cerdos; Cirilo, en abarrotes; Paulina, en borregos y Josefina y Rufina, en pollos.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en la casa de Do\u00f1a Feliza la representante del grupo, ella viste una playera guinda y Do\u00f1a Gilberta un su\u00e9ter rojo*","en":"The members of Cuna de Bel\u00e9n Group know each other very well because they're neighbors in the same community, and they enjoy good relations among themselves.\r\n\r\nGilberta, 52, is a very happy person and her state of mind is contagious among the other members of her group.  She was the mother of nine children, of whom only one of her youngest daughters is still in school.  She had a wonderful family with her husband Rosendo.  While he was working building houses, Gilberta decided to start raising animals to sell so she could help with the household expenses and her children's education, because it was difficult for Rosendo to cover all the expenses.\r\n\r\nGilberta learned at her mother's side when she was little and now has 35 years of experience taking care of chickens, ducks, lambs, pigs, and calves.  She gets up very early to take care of her family and then her animals.  She has always made the most of the land in her community to feed her animals.  The pigs are her most labor-intensive animals, however, and she needs to buy special food for them.  This is what she needs to invest in right now.  Thanks to loans from VisionFund her animals have grown favorably, for which she's grateful.\r\n\r\nWith the profits from her business, now it's easier for Gilberta to buy food, shoes, and school supplies for her children.

Meet Bessy, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Chuka area of Kenya, near the famous Mount Kenya. Bessy, 47, has been farming for the past 10 years. Through these years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, maize, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Bessy is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Chuka area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Bessy could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Bessy, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Bessy believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Bessy to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going

With banana farming, she will be able to sell bananas and other banana products such as banana leaves in the market to boost her income. She will also use the banana leaves in feeding her animals, which will result in increased milk production. The money will help her manage to pay the high costs of inputs that have given her sleepless nights in the past. She loves farming and she aspires to keep growing her business.

They are always in constant communication, they help each other in any circumstance, and they are all dedicated to raising animals. Jos\u00e9 Luciano and Alberto will invest their loan in calves, Valentina and Cecilia will invest in calves as well, and Don Miguel in pigs, his great passion.\r\n\r\nDon Miguel is a very hardworking and friendly man. He is 63 years old and is married to Mrs. Luisa who is a housewife, although she sometimes helps out in the pig business. Together they have a family with seven children of which only one is dependent and is currently studying elementary education.\r\n\r\nIt has been 22 years since Don Miguel decided to begin his business. \"I did not have a steady job and the expenses of our children were too much between food, shoes, and education and because of this I decided to breed animals,\" said Don Miguel who bought a sow at first. Fortunately, at this time he also had a good crop of corn that he used as food and his little pig grew very well. As a result of his effort and dedication to the growth of his first little pig, in four months he already had 10 piglets more. The only difficulty at that time was that he did not have a good sized corral. \r\n\r\nDon Miguel is very thankful to VisionFund and Kiva because he's been taking out loans for 16 years which he has used to expand his business. He now has 12 sows and 41 piglets along with an enormous warehouse which has the impressive capacity to house even more pigs.\r\n\r\nEveryday Don Miguel works with his animals. His clients arrive directly to his house. \"These animals have been my salvation for paying all the costs of my house and my children's education.\" \r\n\r\nThis time he is asking for a loan in order to buy more pigs. Don Miguel has acquired a lot of experience and his earnings are good, nevertheless, he is in trouble when the food price rises.

They live in a small community. The most important crop is corn which the housewives use to make traditional tortillas for your home.\r\n\r\nMa Christina is a bit serious but is also a very hardworking woman. She is 51 years old and is married to Mr. Lorenzo. For many years the couple has lived in the capital of the country and have worked in a supply center selling fruit and vegetables. Since they did not have their own housing in the city, they returned to their hometown where it was much easier to build a small house. However, Cristina had already become accustomed to the rhythm of that life; to sell and have contact with people. Therefore, she decided to begin to sell clothes. \"I remember that in these times the merchandise was very cheap, a garment cost me 25 pesos and my earnings were very good.\" Awhile later she began to sell candy, refreshments, and other sweets. Later she added some grocery products and in this way passed 10 years. Unfortunately the store is not as productive anymore due to the competition in the area.\r\n\r\nDue to the reasons above Cristina decided to ask for a loan from VisionFund in order to buy small pigs, feed, and some wood in order to build a corral. Cristina is very thankful for the help of VisionFund and Kiva because thanks to the loans she was able to maintain activity in her little store and now she is able to open a new business. \"I need more income because my husband is sick and some costs are not covered by health insurance,\" said Cristina.\r\n\r\nThe dream of Mrs. Cristina is that her animals will grow and she will be able to sell them easily in a couple months. She also does not plan to abandon her grocery store and hopes to see it grow.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Ma de los Angeles who will invest in calves, Alejandra who will invest in a grocery store, and Mr. Crescencio who will invest in his greenhouse.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in the municipality on the stairs of the kiosk.
