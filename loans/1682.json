Su actividad principal es una tienda de barrio con alimentos de primera necesidad como; az\u00facar, pan, fideo, arroz, refrescos, aceite, etc., su labor la realiza durante toda la semana y durante todo el d\u00eda. \u201cnaci\u00f3 mi hijo y tuve que buscar trabajo, con un peque\u00f1o capital inicie mi negocio al ver que por el lugar exist\u00eda la necesidad de una tienda de barrio, esto me permite cuidar a mi hijo y a la vez trabajar\u2026\u201d comenta. Su sue\u00f1o es tener un mini-mercado en su propio domicilio. Ella desea abastecer su tienda de barrio comprando alimentos de primera necesidad por mayor. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos en 2 a\u00f1os que viene desarrollando esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Daniela solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de alimentos de primera necesidad por mayor para abastecer su tienda y poder cuidar a su beb\u00e9.\n","en":"Daniela is a 27-year-old woman who is single, has a four-year-old son, and her business is tending to a neighborhood store.  She is a good mother; enterprising, hardworking, steadfast, and responsible.  She carries out her business in the \"Cupesi\" neighborhood, an area known for its huge growth in population; miners who relocated from the west and ethnic groups like the Ayores who are native to the area have all settled down here.  The following generation mostly deals with commerce and manufacturing in all areas.  Cupesi has a warm, tropical, and humid climate, with a temperature that varies from 21-35 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n\r\nDaniela has a dark complexion, long dark hair tied back in a ponytail, and is short.  Her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks around her family, but she speaks Spanish in the community and at work.  (She is seated on the left and is wearing a pink shirt and jean skirt.)  She shares her life with her son who plays all day long because he is still not old enough for school.  They live in a rental house that is made of brick and has a corrugated metal roof.  It has potable water, electricity, and a sewage system.  \r\n\r\nHer desire to improve brought her to lead a communal bank of people whose businesses include selling alpaca sweaters, selling aprons, selling children's jackets, selling skirts, selling smoothies, upholstering vehicles, and a welding workshop.  This allows her to ask for a loan and accomplish her goals.  Daniela's main job is a neighborhood store for staple foods like sugar, bread, noodles, rice, soda, oil, etc.  She does her work during the week and all day long.  \"My son was born and I had to find a job.  With a little money, I began my business after seeing that the area needed a neighborhood store.  This allows me to care for my son and work at the same time,\" she says.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a mini-market in her own home.  She wishes to stock up her neighborhood store by purchasing wholesale staple foods.  This is her first cycle of loans in the two years that she has carried out this work.  It is for these reasons that Daniela asks for a loan in order to buy wholesale staple foods to stock up her store and be able to care for her baby."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":1813663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy wholesale staple foods in order to stock up her store and be able to care for her baby.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-02-12T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-14T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":18500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1371.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1420.72},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1446.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1472.91},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.72},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1527.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1554.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1583.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1611.91},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1675.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1701.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.35},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":618.66,"local_amount":4238.99,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4268.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624227101},{"amount":433.84,"local_amount":2972.63,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:30:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2993.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214292},{"amount":449.78,"local_amount":3081.81,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3103.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564413},{"amount":466.3,"local_amount":3195.02,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3217.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046380},{"amount":483.1,"local_amount":3310.13,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3333.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344201},{"amount":248.32,"local_amount":1701.42,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1713.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554428}],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T17:29:51Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":838814,"name":"Sharbon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sharbon is living in a remote district.

She sells tortillas and tamales every day of the week. Eusebia is very dedicated to her family and to the service of others. Her husband works with metal structures.\r\n\r\nEusebia learned to sell tortillas and tamales from her grandmother who spent all her life selling tortillas in the village. One of Eusebia's daughters helps her with sales during the morning, then she studies in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe money will be utilized to purchase medications and pay for a medical consultation, because, lately, she has suffered from back pain and this preoccupies her. Another part of the money will go towards buying a sack of corn for making tortillas. In this manner, she will be able to continue working and enjoying better health while working for her family.\r\n\r\nEusebia's dream is to establish a more formal business. She is planning to construct installations that will be more adequate to work in every day. Also, she plans to begin selling breakfasts and lunches.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1653637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical Expenses","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to buy medications and to pay for a medical consultation for her back pain.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-02-12T16:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-14T16:40:06Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eusebia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":34.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":36.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":36.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":38.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":39.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.81},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":43.31},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":45.07},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":46.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":49.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.62},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.31},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.07},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.53,"local_amount":73.53,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:08:37Z","rounded_local_amount":73.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833775},{"amount":55.38,"local_amount":55.38,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":55.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636201548},{"amount":46.77,"local_amount":46.77,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:22:12Z","rounded_local_amount":46.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650537280},{"amount":42.99,"local_amount":42.99,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":42.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666803158},{"amount":44.79,"local_amount":44.79,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":44.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683483231},{"amount":46.04,"local_amount":46.04,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":46.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696540794},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":45.84,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:53:25Z","rounded_local_amount":45.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711454273},{"amount":144.66,"local_amount":144.66,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:54:31Z","rounded_local_amount":144.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730974851}],"funded_date":"2015-02-17T15:38:20Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T13:54:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":838846,"name":"Fitroyah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Good day, lenders!

La mam\u00e1 de Do\u00f1a Cecilia tambi\u00e9n tuvo un negocio de tortillas y eso mismo motiv\u00f3 a Cecilia a iniciar la actividad. \n\nCecilia trabaja todos los d\u00edas de 8:00 am a 5:00 pm y descansa los mi\u00e9rcoles pero una de sus hijas atiende el negocio. Adem\u00e1s, cuenta con la ayuda de una chica durante los domingos que es cuando tiene m\u00e1s trabajo o en pedidos especiales para eventos. \n\nElla est\u00e1 muy contenta y agradecida con VisionFund y KIVA porque los pr\u00e9stamos le han ayudado a mantener su negocio y a pesar de la competencia que tiene tambi\u00e9n cuenta con buenos clientes y sigue teniendo buenas ganancias. Do\u00f1a Cecilia quiere seguir apoyando a su hijo ya que le ha comentado que quiere ser militar y para ello necesita continuar trabando muy fuerte. Otra de sus metas es abrir una tortiller\u00eda en otra comunidad.\n\nLas dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son M\u00f3nica quien invertir\u00e1 en su cultivo de ma\u00edz; Elizabeth, en sus vacas; Liliana, en ropa de cama; Teodora, en zapatos; Rufina, en antojitos y Maria Teresa, en su molino.\n\n*La fotografia fue tomada en el municipio en las escaleras debajo del quiosco, Do\u00f1a Cecilia es quien viste el su\u00e9ter blanco*","en":"The group \"Chicas Emprendedoras\" [\"Enterprising Girls\"] is comprised of seven women between which there is a bond of friendship that has united them for several years. They live in the same quiet community and all strive everyday to improve the quality of life for their families.\r\n\r\nCecilia is the most cheerful of the group, always making her companions laugh. She is 42 years old and married to a man named Ra\u00fal who works as a chauffeur. She has three children, only one of which is dependent on them - a boy studying in secondary school.\r\n\r\nFor approximately 2 years, Cecilia has been making tortillas. Prior to that she raised pigs and chickens. Unfortunately, she got sick and to cover all costs of treatment, she had to sell all her animals.\r\n\r\nNow she is asking for a loan from VisionFund to buy corn, lime, bags, presses, paper, etc. to continue her business of tortillas.\r\n\r\nWith a big smile, Cecilia says \"I am very happy because in addition to going well, I like this business. As a child, I already knew how to make tortillas.\" Cecilia's mother also had a tortilla business and this motivated Cecilia to start this activity.\r\n\r\nCecilia works every day from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm and rests on Wednesdays, but one of her daughters attends to the business. She also has a girl to help her on Sundays since they have more work or special orders for events.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and appreciative of VisionFund and KIVA because the loans have helped her to maintain her business despite competition. The business has good customers and good profits. Cecilia wants to continue supporting her son. He wants to be in the military and therefore needs to continue working hard. Another of her goals is to open a tortilla shop in another community.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: M\u00f3nica who will invest in her corn crop; Elizabeth, in her cows; Liliana, in linens; Teodora, in shoes; Rufina, in snacks; and Maria Teresa in her mill.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in town on the stairs below the pavillion.

She lives with her husband, and she has a 15-year-old son and a 26-year-old daughter.  Her business is fast-food sales.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, and she enterprising, responsible, persevering, and hard-working.  She works in the \u201cBuenos Aires\u201d zone, an area that is characterized by commerce and all kinds of manufacturing, where tailor shops, fried-chicken restaurants, bookstores, and all kinds of businesses are found side by side. It has a climate that is dry and cold year round, with a day-time temperature between 4 and 14 degrees Centigrade.\r\n\r\nCleofe is tan-skinned and short of stature, with a robust physique and long black hair that she wears tied back in a pony-tail.  Her mother tongue is Aymara, which she speaks when she is with family; speaking Spanish with the general public and for her business.  She has completed her primary school studies.  She shares her life with her husband, who works as a farmer and continually travels to the fields with their children.  Their oldest daughter works and studies; and their youngest son helps her in her business and studies in school. They live in her mother-in-law\u2019s house, and they have basic services such as electricity, drinking water, and sewer.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling fast food such as traditional hamburgers (made with ground beef), salchipapas (French fries and sausage), hot dogs, egg sandwiches, and meat sandwiches, in a rented stall.  She says, \u201cI started working at a very young age, as my family was poor, and I never had any problems. My children work and study, my husband travels constantly\u201d. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own sales stall where she would no longer have to pay rent, and could sell her food around the clock.

Loyford is a 35-year-old father of two who practices mixed farming for a living. He comes from Chuka (Central Kenya) where he has been doing this work for 6 years. \r\n\r\nHis primary income sources are from selling milk, eggs, and maize, as well as income from personal business. Loyford\u2019s hobby is feeding chicks! He ensures the health of his farm by watering plants and tending to his animals. \r\n\r\nLoyford is seeking a loan to construct poultry housing and to purchase more poultry. Many rural farmers in Kenya keep poultry because they provide them with companionship, as well as food and fibre in the form of eggs, meat, and feathers. With your loan, Loyford will not only enjoy raising chickens for fresh eggs and meat, but also tap into the large commercial chicken industry. The housing will provide comfort, protection, and efficient production for the poultry.\r\n\r\nLoyford will also benefit from the convenience the house will afford him. The money he will make as a result will help him pay for his children\u2019s education. His family at large will enjoy an improved standard of living."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":114.62,"image":{"id":1813223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-12T19:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-14T19:20:18Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.53,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Loyford","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1457.38},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1061.6},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1092.62},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1124.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1157.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1191.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1226.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1261.89},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1298.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1336.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1375.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1416}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.12},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.9},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.05},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.48,"local_amount":1412.32,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265144},{"amount":12.25,"local_amount":1049.96,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1123.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601290},{"amount":13.65,"local_amount":1170.23,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1251.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459791},{"amount":13.9,"local_amount":1201,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1284.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.11,"payment_id":681378185},{"amount":13.27,"local_amount":1153.37,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1233.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.19,"payment_id":696587873},{"amount":14,"local_amount":1254.15,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1341.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.63,"payment_id":711506163},{"amount":14.86,"local_amount":1303.48,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1394.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.35,"payment_id":731022996},{"amount":14.68,"local_amount":1279.89,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1368.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.25,"payment_id":752111158}],"funded_date":"2015-02-13T18:34:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tom D"}},{"id":838863,"name":"Ahmad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Good day, lenders!

She knows that more items in her store will yield more sales and thus increase her earnings. Her income from her store is a stable source to sustain her family's basic needs and for the education of her children. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. \r\n\r\nGenalen plans to open a bigger general store and aims to give her children the best education possible for them to have a better future. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies .\r\n\r\n *All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her house doesn't have drinkable water. She is a good mother, independent, responsible, entrepreneurial, and hardworking. Her business is located in Sacaba, a rural area which is kept like a farm for her town, to produce cereal, vegetables and fruit, rice, wheat, barley, leafy greens, strawberries, bananas, papayas, oranges, apples, peaches, and even tumbo plants. Most of the place's buildings are old and don't have basic services, in the area's hot, semi-tropical climate. \n\nJhancarla has dark skin, large black hair, dark eyes and is short. Her maternal language is Quechua, which she speaks as well as a general knowledge of Spanish. \n\nShe lives her life with her partner, who works as a chauffeur, and her son, who isn't old enough yet to be in school. They live in an unfinished house, made of bricks, and they use well water and electricity. Her house is made of two rooms, the windows and doors don't have glass, and the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room have no water. \n\nHer dream is to finish building the house, and to install drinkable water in the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room, to provide a better future for her family. This is her first loan cycle with this institution in the four years that she has been building her house. It's for these reasons that Jhancarla is asking for this loan to install drinkable water in her kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room to provide a safe and comfortable home for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1808314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to set up drinkable water in her kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room, in order to provide a safe and comfortable home for her family.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-02-12T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-14T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhancarla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":508.02},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":541.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":535.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":558.57},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":563},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":574.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":589.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":595.32},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":617.41},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":625.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":637.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":652.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.41},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.37},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.42,"local_amount":508.26,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":514.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624227086},{"amount":79.95,"local_amount":546.01,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":552.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214270},{"amount":77.78,"local_amount":531.17,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:30:39Z","rounded_local_amount":537.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564392},{"amount":82.36,"local_amount":562.44,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":569.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046359},{"amount":82.94,"local_amount":566.39,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":573.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344182},{"amount":83.12,"local_amount":567.67,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":574.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554413},{"amount":86.34,"local_amount":589.65,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":596.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468549},{"amount":458.09,"local_amount":3128.41,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3165.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296416}],"funded_date":"2015-02-20T17:00:03Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlie Hersh","image":null}},{"id":838960,"name":"Fuarosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fuarosa is a woman, 23 years old, with three children.

She is in a relationship and, together with her life partner, had 2 children.\n\nMar\u00eda has been making a living selling tortillas for two years. She decided to follow this occupation to be able to give her children everything they need. Mar\u00eda walks four blocks to get to her tortilla stand, and she works from 6:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day.\n\nThe loan she is requesting from the institution is to buy corn, firewood, bags, paper, and a cooler. With this purchase, she hopes to generate more income to give her family a better quality of life.\n\nMar\u00eda's dream is to expand her tortilla business, extend her home, and change its metal sheeting because the one it has is too damaged. In addition, she wants her children to study so that they become professionals in the future and have better employment opportunities.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1803829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase corn, firewood, bags, paper, and a cooler.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-02-12T20:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-14T20:00:04Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":20.89},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":22.35},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":22.21},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":23.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":23.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":24.32},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25.07},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":27.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":29.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.32},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.07},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.22,"local_amount":23.22,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":23.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833742},{"amount":21.51,"local_amount":21.51,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":21.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636201482},{"amount":23.91,"local_amount":23.91,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:21:58Z","rounded_local_amount":23.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650537213},{"amount":24.8,"local_amount":24.8,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":24.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666803098},{"amount":23.71,"local_amount":23.71,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":23.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683483172},{"amount":25.63,"local_amount":25.63,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":25.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696540734},{"amount":26.08,"local_amount":26.08,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":26.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711454229},{"amount":26.76,"local_amount":26.76,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":26.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730974815},{"amount":104.38,"local_amount":104.38,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:34:09Z","rounded_local_amount":104.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752063371}],"funded_date":"2015-02-12T23:53:50Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:34:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Flores","image":null}},{"id":838957,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is 49 years old and widowed, and she has five children, four of whom are currently in school.\r\n\r\nJanet is in the agricultural business, engaged in pig fattening in the Philippines.

The name \"Tayipa Kame\" is from the local indigenous dialect and translates into Spanish as \"Mujeres Trabajando,\" or \"Women Working\" in English.   \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Marisol is one of the Tayipa Kame members, and is 35 years old, married, and the mother of two children. A few years ago, she studied dressmaking, taking several courses at the National Training Institute (Instituto Nacional de Aprendizaje in Spanish). She then started making clothes and doing tailoring jobs to order. \r\n\r\nMarisol's husband does seasonal work, and wages across the reason are very low. She therefore has a second business that provides another source of income, raising chickens at her home. Marisol's two businesses generate much of the income her family needs to meet its household expenses and pay for her children's education. \r\n\r\nThis is Marisol's  third loan, and she's very excited about working with the Foundation. The organization has supported her businesses before, and allowed her to improve her family's living conditions.

a\u00f1os solicitando pr\u00e9stamo a VisionFund M\u00e9xico y aunque realmente no ha podido tener un reba\u00f1o muy grande, est\u00e1 agradecido porque con sus ganancias puede sacar adelante a su familia. Ahora necesita m\u00e1s capital para comprar cuatro borreguitos y que Gregoria, tan entregada como siempre, contin\u00fae apoy\u00e1ndolo para obtener ingresos y ayudar a sus cuatro hijos que a\u00fan est\u00e1n estudiando.\n\nLas dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Reyna y Teresa quienes solicitan su cr\u00e9dito para invertir en sus borreguitos y Emilia quien invertir\u00e1 en sus borregos y costuras.\n","en":"The place where the members of this group live is a Mazahua community whose inhabitants are friendly and still conserve their mother language and traditional dress and some festivals. <br \/><br \/>Alfredo is 39 years old and is very responsible and moreover hard-working. He has been married to Gregoria for 19 years and together they formed a family with 8 children. Four of them are still dependent. <br \/><br \/>Alfredo has worked raising and fattening sheep for 22 years. He buys them when they are small and keeps them a number of months. He started this business because the income he got from his work as a bricklayer wasn't sufficient to cover the expenses of his children. When Alfredo works in Mexico City his wife helps him caring for the sheep, \"I don't remember exactly how many sheep we started with but it was less than 4\", Alfredo commented. <br \/><br \/>He has been requesting loans from VIsionFund M\u00e9xico for a number of years. And although he couldn't really have a bigger flock of sheep he is grateful as his profits get his family ahead. Now he needs more capital to buy 4 sheep, as Gregoria devoted as usual, to obtain income and help his 4 children who are still studying which is Alfredo's dream. The other members of the group are Reyna and Teresa who want the loan to invest in their sheep and Emilia who will invest in sheep and sewing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1806551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy four sheep and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Miguel La Labor, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-02-12T21:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-14T21:20:13Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6036.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423895},{"amount":400,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":6036.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769227},{"amount":400,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6036.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649763985},{"amount":400,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":6036.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597691}],"funded_date":"2015-02-12T21:58:53Z","paid_date":"2015-06-18T13:26:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":836225,"name":"Priscela Yesenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la calle San Eduardo v\u00eda a Santa Ana de la ciudad de Portoviejo, conocida como la Ciudad de Los Reales Tamarindos desde \u00e9pocas coloniales se re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas las socias del Grupo De Cr\u00e9dito 16 de Julio.\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Priscela, tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera de dos  hijos de 10 y 6 a\u00f1os los mismos que estudian en escuela.\nDo\u00f1a Priscela tiene una tienda en su casa donde vende productos, como arroz, az\u00facar, aceites, detergentes, gaseosas, entre otros productos, su tienda es peque\u00f1a pero le deja lo necesario para salir adelante junto  a sus hijos, trabaja todos los d\u00edas y todo el d\u00eda.\nElla est\u00e1 repitiendo el cr\u00e9dito ya que es as\u00ed como ella surte cada vez m\u00e1s su tienda, ella siempre invierte sus ganancias en las necesidades que hay en su hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de sus peque\u00f1os.

She lives with her husband, who is disabled and receives a pension from the local government. The family lives in poverty, having no source of income except social assistance and her husband's pension. This mentioned income is hardly enough for them to cover even basic needs. Because of the above-mentioned situation, Nino lacks the access to capital markets to obtain credit to start her own business. Her loan request was rejected several times, as creditors did not find enough income sufficient to approve the loan. The startup program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enabled her to get a loan of 500 GEL to start a trading business. \r\n\r\nNino plans to purchase agricultural products in a nearby village and sell them at increased prices in town. She will sell cheese, yogurt, fruits and other products at the underground area, which is always crowded, and Nino will always have costumers among passersby.\r\n \r\nThe new business initiative will be great support to this poor couple as they will get the chance to satisfy basic needs and overcome financial difficulties.

This new loan will go to purchase additional grocery items and sacks of rice, which is his primary product, needed in his variety store. His customers will likely buy more items if he has a greater variety of products displayed in his store. An increase in sales will also result in a significant increase in profit, which will also result in his business becoming viable and sustainable. Simultaneously, he could sustain the needs of his family.\r\n\r\nAside from growing his business, Jorge wants his family to be always healthy, and it is his dream to give them a better life in the coming years.

They live in the town of San Miguel Due\u00f1as, about eight miles from the city of La Antigua, Sacatep\u00e9quez, Guatemala. The area in which they live is known for the many vegetables and beautiful flowers that are grown there.  During the first two cycles the women have worked hard at keeping track of their sales and expenses in their notebooks. They have been punctual in making their loan payments and have been conscientious in implementing the advice of their Business Advisor. They are now eagerly looking forward to another nine-month cycle with Namaste in which they will learn more about managing their finances and receive more advice from their Business Advisor.\nDo\u00f1a Felipa is a hard working entrepreneur.  She is 52 years old and married with grown children.  She lives in a simple house, that she built over the course of many years, with money from her several businesses. Her main business is a nursery that she operates out of her home.  She sells a variety of plants that she grows from seed and she sells beans that she plants and harvests on her property. She also keeps chickens that she buys young and later sells. Her goal for the next nine months with Namaste is to increase the assortment of plants she can sell and to cultivate more beans and grains and she also wants to increase the sale of chickens.  At the end of the second cycle her monthly net profit was 4115 Guatemalan Quetzales.  She is projecting a monthly net profit of Q5129 from a 56% increase in sales.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1801280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy more chickens and plants for her nusery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Miguel Due\u00f1as, Sacatep\u00e9quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2015-02-12T23:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-14T23:40:10Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria De La Cruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ofelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra Nohemi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":17500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1944.44},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1944.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1944.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1944.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1944.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1944.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1944.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1944.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1944.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.56},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":255.56,"local_amount":1944.44,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1956.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624235320},{"amount":255.56,"local_amount":1944.44,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1956.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636221234},{"amount":255.56,"local_amount":1944.44,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:15:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1956.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649572948},{"amount":255.56,"local_amount":1944.44,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-26T12:10:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1956.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665053596},{"amount":255.55,"local_amount":1944.44,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1956.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681351663},{"amount":255.55,"local_amount":1944.44,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:59:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1956.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696562052},{"amount":511.1,"local_amount":3888.88,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:48:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3912.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711477239},{"amount":255.56,"local_amount":1944.48,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-22T13:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1956.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730996057}],"funded_date":"2015-02-19T18:34:46Z","paid_date":"2015-11-22T13:10:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":838988,"name":"Thoeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thoeun (shown in picture) is 43 years old and lives at Posen Chey district, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

He is a hardworking man and aggressive with the principle of truth on his lips; he is honest and faithful to what he does and what he says. James is also the father of two lovely children.  \r\n\r\n\u201cKaplamai\u201d in the local dialect means \u201cvalley\u201d. In this valley are a people who, in their totality, constitute wrenching statistics. Hardcore poverty pervades every homestead yet every day when you look beyond the numbers, you will see a sea of people: a sea of about two thousand bright, vibrant, open faces, searching and yearning for the opportunity to live a life of dignity and respect. \r\n\r\nThey have the conviction that it\u2019s possible. Armed with this conviction, James has kept hope and has been toiling on his farm for the past 7 years. His primary sources of income have been milk, poultry, and some \u201cside hustles\u201d(Motorcycle business) he does to supplement the meager income he earns from farming. \r\n\r\nThe Kaplamai area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a sea of people, but the mill keeps breaking down; hence farmers are not able to grind their maize. James intends to change this and is requesting a loan to buy an electric posho mill, which will grind corn or maize into flour. Maize meal is very common in Kenya and is a staple food for many communities. Many Kenyan families consume the maize product \u201cugali\u201c (hard porridge) regularly. \r\n\r\nThe market usually provides sifted flour, but the cost is higher because of the sifting and packaging. Cheaper flour can be obtained by milling the maize directly using a posho mill. \r\n\r\nThrough this loan, James will be able to grind maize faster because he will use an electric posho mill. Cases of breakdown will be history, because electric posho mills are more reliable. \r\n\r\nThis loan will assist James to permanently change his life and achieve his life's mission of bringing economic development and poverty alleviation to communities in arid and semi-arid areas. Profits from the posho mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan, which James promises to fully repay on time. \r\n\r\nIn the next two years, James sees himself as an established businessman who will be running more than one posho mill in his remote village. \r\n\r\nJames patiently waits for your kindness."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1813292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy an electric posho mill","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-13T01:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-15T01:00:16Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":180000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5279.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5433.79},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5592.6},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5756.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5924.26},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6097.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6275.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6459},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6647.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6842.04},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":7042},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":7247.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":7459.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":7677.63},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":7902.01},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":8132.94},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":8370.63},{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":8615.26},{"due_date":"2016-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":8867.01},{"due_date":"2016-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":9126.18},{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":9392.89},{"due_date":"2016-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":9667.4},{"due_date":"2016-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":9949.93},{"due_date":"2017-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":10240.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.62},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.16},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.9},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.94},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.53},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.85},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.24},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.7},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.24},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.84},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.53},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.29},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.14},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.06},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.07},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.17},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iris Belen","image":697625}},{"id":839043,"name":"Nicholas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nicholas and his wife have worked on their current farm situated in the outskirts of Siongiroi town, Kenya, since 2000. Since then, their farm and family have grown in more ways than one. In 2010, the couple started working on a run-down farm. Today, they are making money off the poultry and dairy animals they raise and also the maize and vegetables they grow. Nicholas has further invested in transportation services to reduce their transportation costs and make money offering the service to other farmers. <br \/><br \/>Nicholas loves to dairy farm, especially since it was always a life goal of his to be a farmer. His wife understands this and together they joined hearts and hands to make the farm's success to date happen. Nicholas is seeking a loan to purchase a pedigree dairy cow. There are more than 100 cattle breeds in Kenya. However, not all are good producers of milk. In fact, very few are. Cattle aside, the tastes and preferences of milk in the market is really growing in diversity in Kenya. Drinking milk is no longer a matter of pouring it into our cereal bowl, adding it to our coffee, or drinking it straight from the glass, we now have preferences in the type of milk we drink. <br \/><br \/>Today, milk consumers are spoiled for choice. In the market, we have old-fashioned cow\u2019s milk and lactose-free milk, not to mention non-dairy options such as soy, almond, rice and coconut milk. It takes dairy masters like Nicholas to pick up these shifts in the market and adopt ingenious techniques in farming to ensure that their product qualities adapt to the changes in consumer preference. Purchasing a pedigree cow goes to show how Nicholas is keen on controlling lameness levels in his dairy cattle. He considers breeding to be the core of his overall strategy of ensuring that milk quantity is way above average and the milk quality is second to none in the market. He anticipates that feeding will be his highest cost of milk production. This, to him, is accepted because to get cows that milk well and remain healthy, they have to be fed properly. <br \/><br \/>Your loan will make a significant difference to Nicholas's farm profitability. The couple will make use of the returns from this investment to pay for the loan, pay for their children\u2019s education and the rest will be reinvested in the business. It has always been their ambition to share their passion about farming with their children. They hope the kids will be thrilled to join the business of running the family farm. By helping Nicholas you will be helping a farmer who takes litres of milk daily to large businesses where it is distributed and then consumed by thousands of

Khurmi. He is married and has four children. His wife's name is Khadisa and she is a homemaker. Okiljon drives a taxi, plants crops and raises livestock to earn a living. \n\nOkiljon has a dream, however.

Meet Isaac, a hardworking, dedicated and honest 52-year-old dairy farmer. As the key breadwinner of his family, with a wife and three children, he farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Nyamira, in the Nyanza region of Kenya. For the past 21 years, he has been practicing mixed farming and his primary source of income has been selling milk, eggs and maize. He also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income he earns through farming. Isaac passionately loves dairy farming but the biggest challenge he faces is feeding his cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. He is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy shed and buy another quality breed of dairy cow. Through the loan, he will have a humble time milking his cow and also feeding. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and it also protects them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Isaac also intends to buy not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 15-25 litres of milk a day. The selling price for milk is 40 Kenya shillings per liter and through this loan; he will be making a cool US $11 per day. Before Isaac joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance that supports smallholder farmers with technical and financial solutions, he considered dairy farming to be a mediocre fallback occupation that did not have a future promise for income generation. After training, Isaac now believes that dairy farming is the business to go into if you want a rather less rough way into the \u201cmillionaires club\u201d. With the loan, Isaac will increase his income from milk selling and his cows will have more food to eat and never reject food. The key to high yield in milk production is proper feeding of the cows and through this loan, Isaac will achieve this. An increase in income will allow Isaac to improve his living conditions and secure the future of his children. His dream is to continue improving his dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards.

She was born in the small town of Isfara. Karima is the mother of two wonderful children: her son is 17 years old and her daughter is 23 years old. Karima has dedicated her life to her children and has always done what she could so that her children would be well taken care of. Karima has no college degree, and finding work in her region is hard in any case, so she learned how to saw and takes orders for women's clothing. She is mostly assisted by her daughter in this work.\r\n\r\nThe reason Karima is applying for a loan is the lack of funds for a new sewing machine. For a long time she has been using a single old sewing machine, wishing for a modern one with many stitch functions. Karima has been saving money, but still does not have enough. She thinks she has taken the right decision to apply for a loan. She trusts in your goodwill.

Today, this humble father of four children sells milk, eggs, maize, and a variety of food crops. He is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge he has about farming, he commands a lot of respect from other farmers in his village. Dairy farming is close to his heart and every day he wakes up to milk his cows and that makes him very proud. \r\n\r\nAlthough he makes profits through milk selling, he lacks a proper dairy unit and he is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit.  A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions and rain. Raphael believes that this loan will change his living conditions  because he is going to  increase milk production.

That was the case with Aleyda, 32, a persevering woman who saw the opportunity to improve life for herself and her family.

Three years ago, this smiling woman made the most of her proximity to a school and built her school-supplies business with only the capital she saved selling beauty products and a few cardboard boxes.\r\n\r\nAleyda's the mother of three children, ages 12, 6, and 2, who are her motivation for getting ahead.  She has support from her husband as well as from a brother who sends her remittances.\r\n\r\nHer dream is for her business to look better, so she wants to keep investing in it.  That's why she's requesting a loan to buy school supplies such as notebooks, pencils, erasers, folders, and other products to take advantage of the return to classes.\r\n\r\nThis will allow her to provide better service, earn more profits, and ensure a prosperous future for her children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":749.97,"image":{"id":1813769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy school supplies like notebooks, pencils, erasers, folders, and other products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2015-02-13T15:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-15T15:40:05Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aleyda Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624462012},{"amount":83.86,"local_amount":83.86,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-19T11:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636864924},{"amount":82.8,"local_amount":82.8,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":82.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649617156},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:10:45Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665097258},{"amount":85.83,"local_amount":85.83,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":85.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681395518},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696605818},{"amount":81.4,"local_amount":81.4,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":81.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711528271},{"amount":82.76,"local_amount":82.76,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":82.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731044211},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:11:46Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752133189}],"funded_date":"2015-02-26T00:06:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":839207,"name":"Bety's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bety, pictured above, is a group leader and is representing her group, formed by eleven farmers in Webuye District, Kenya.

She is 32 years old. She has two children. Her children are in school and her husband is working abroad in the Russian Federation. Now that the children have grown a bit, Sudoba is left with more time. She decided not to waste time and to invest in a profitable trade. She wants to start a new business. Sudoba will bake and sell traditional flatbreads. She is an excellent cook and is confident that she will succeed. <br \/><br \/>To start the new activity, she needs an oven, firewood and products for preparing flatbreads. Sudoba has an oven (which you can see in the photo). She needs to buy firewood and ingredients (flour, salt, oil, yeast). For the purchase of all this, she applied for a loan. Sudoba believes that thanks to Kiva lenders she will be able to start a business.

For the last six years, Begayim has been raising livestock and crops, having begun her business with the purchase of one cow. Thanks to her hard work, Begayim currently has on her homestead four cows and five sheep. She also rents 1.0 hectare of land where she grows maize for internal consumption and sale. Begayim's business brings in about 10,000 som (KGS) per month. With the aim of further developing her business, she applied to Bai-Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) for increasing the headcount of dairy cows.
