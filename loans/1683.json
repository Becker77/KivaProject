This is an important source of income for the community.  The group members work in different areas which are a source of income for their families.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources, they could not attend school and needed to start working at a young age.  Currently, they fight for their children to succeed and to be able to provide them with better opportunities in life.  One of their main dreams is to have their children become professionals.\r\n\r\nThanks to her efforts to succeed, the group coordinator is Pricila.  She works making and selling bread.  Her business is located in her home.  Pricila's work routine is to spend ten hours a day making and offering her products, including cookies, bizcotela [a type of bread covered in sugar], croissants, pastries, empanadas, rin bread, cakes, rolls, and other items.  She will use this loan to invest in working capital and stock her business to buy and sell bread so that in the near future she can earn more income.  \r\n\r\nThe Milagro de Dios group is grateful for

She is 34 years old. She is married and the mother of three children. Her one daughter is six years old, and her sons are still small at the ages of four years and nine months. Her huband is working abroad to make a living and support the family. Sanavbar had a dream to learn the skill of cutting and sewing women's clothing to start a new career and earn a living. Thanks to her mother, she learned this craft and now would like to start her own sewing business. However, in order to start a new business she needs to buy a sewing machine. Because of insufficient funds, she applied for a loan, by which she intends to purchase an electronic sewing machine and also other sewing implements. With the help of a loan, she will have work and ongoing income that will allow her to improve the financial situation of her

They are native to El Sauce, a place that is located in the northern zone of the region. They are known for being hard workers, responsible, with the desire for self-improvement. They are entrepreneurial women with different economic activities, who are providers for their families. Unfortunately, due to the lack of economic resources, they were not able to study and they saw themselves as obligated to work from an early age to help with the home expenses.\r\n\r\nThanks to her perseverance and desire to come out ahead, the coordinator is Liduvina. Her economic activity is the production and sale of tortillas, an activity that she has carried out in her home for ten years. Liduvina\u2019s work routine is one of ten hours a day.

health will improve as toxic smoke produced by burning wood is eliminated from the house. \r\n\r\nJuan plans to invest the savings he will make into a milking machine and tools to irrigate his field, resulting in higher productivity. \r\n\r\nIn the medium term, Juan would also like to buy additional cows to reach higher milk production capacity.\r\n\r\nThis loan represents 20% of the total cost of

Further, the biodigester produces nutrient-rich and organic fertilizer with important properties that nourish soils and increase crops' yield in a sustainable manner. As he generates savings, he plans to invest in improving the backyard for his cows, and improve the quality of their food.\r\n\r\nThis loan represents 8% of the total cost of the biodigester, the remaining part being covered by a government subsidy.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1812033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He gets his products from a wholesaler at a lower price then sells the goods per piece at a profit.\r\n\r\nHe desires to expand his store so he is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan to buy additional groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He is positive that he will become a successful businessman in the future. He looks forward to seeing his children finish their studies through all his hard work and perseverance.\r\n\r\nJerry meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his life and business every week and also draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is single, and she has an 18-year-old son and a 13-year-old daughter. Her business is selling spare parts for automobiles. \r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, optimistic, with a good attitude, committed to her work, generous, likable, independent, responsible and hard-working. She operates her business in the \u2018Villa Dolores\u2019 zone, one of the city's first urbanized areas, where very rapid but disorganized population growth brought together a great number of merchants. These include vendors with fixed locations and mobile vendors, including boys and girls who work at the market together with their parents, and some who work independently. The area has a cold, dry climate with a temperature which varies during the day between 0 and 14 degrees Centigrade. \r\n\r\nSimona has brown skin and long black hair, which she wears braided. She has a sturdy build and is short in stature, and she wears traditional clothing (shawl, skirt and hat). Her native language is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks at home. She also speaks Spanish because of the broader culture and the work that she does. She lives with her children at her side: her son operates a mechanic's workshop in their home, and her daughter is in school. They live in a house of their own, constructed of brick with a roof made of metal sheeting. The house has water, electricity, gas and sewer services. Her main work is selling spare parts for cars, such as alternators, starters, shock absorbers, batteries, accessories, cables, belts, filters, windshield wipers, spark plugs, etc. \"My son operates a mechanic's shop, which was a motive for me to start my spare parts business. I have customers who come from the workshop, and others come on their own,\" she comments. Her dream is to have a large spare parts store. She would like to buy a variety of car parts to increase her offerings and meet her customers' needs. This is the first sequence of loans in the two-and-a-half years she has been carrying out this activity. For these reasons, Simona is requesting a loan to buy a variety of spare parts for cars, to expand her stock and generate increased sales.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1814415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a variety of spare parts for cars, to expand her stock and generate increased sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-02-13T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-15T22:00:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":497.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":497.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":483.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":528.9},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":536.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":560.04},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":590.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":601.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":648.45},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":665.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":692.7},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":697.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.89},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.56},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.03},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.95},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.43},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":995.97,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1007.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214298},{"amount":70.75,"local_amount":483.22,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":488.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564419},{"amount":77.45,"local_amount":528.9,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:27Z","rounded_local_amount":535.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046385},{"amount":78.56,"local_amount":536.48,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":542.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344206},{"amount":652.4,"local_amount":4455.43,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4507.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554431}],"funded_date":"2015-03-12T02:36:28Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":839495,"name":"Lilet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilet is a 46-year-old mother of five children who owns and manages their family carenderia (eatery) business.

She was born in 1976, and she lives in a remote area. She was raised in a family of farmers. Her parents were workers at a collective farm in the period of the USSR. Muborak was taught how to work on the land from her childhood. Her parents did not have money to educate their children. \r\n\r\nWhen she became older, her parents gave her out to marriage. She has four children now. When she had her fourth child, her husband and she thought about how to keep a family for the future. They experienced some difficulties in this period. Her husband had to fly to Russia to earn money. Muborak and her husband wanted to keep their family safe and educate their children well. For the first time her husband could not send money. Muborak tried to keep a family alone. She tried to spend money only for everyday food. They even did not buy clothes. \r\n\r\nWhen the collective farm spread land out for farmers, Muborak also asked for help to have land for planting seeds and earning some income. The collective farm gave her land for planting. After about two years, she is planting cotton, sunflowers and Lucerne. Her children are helping her to do the business. She had honored cattle, but she had a debt that needed to be paid, so she sold her cattle. The profits that she gets from planting seeds cover all the expenditures of her family. \r\n\r\nThis year, the harvest is not good, so she needs to improve her land.

Meet one of Ruma\u2019s agents, Ajat. This is the third time he is asking a loan from Kiva. \r\n\r\nAjat lives in South Bogor, West Java, located about an hour's drive from Jakarta, the capital city. He lives there with his wife and his only child. Ajat works as a guard for a villa located near his house. He joined Ruma two years ago. He wanted to join Ruma because he wants to learn about how to start up a business, as well as contribute more to his community. His community sees him as a trusted mobile service provider and he has a friendly and cheerful personality as well.\r\n\r\nNow, Ajat is becoming an agent of Ruma\u2019s product called Mapan. Mapan is an e-commerce product for lower communities. By serving Mapan to his customers, Ajat will be able to receive orders from customers who want to buy products that have been listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer orders, Ajat will simply send an SMS in a format to the SMS center and then the customer will pay him. Then, Ruma\u2019s agent will come to him to collect the money, and within 3-5 days, the product will be delivered right to the customer's door.\r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Ajat is hoping to get another working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the loan to provide more mobile payment services to his community. Having known about the importance, your loan will be very useful in helping Ajat to improve his business and accordingly, his community, which needs access to such services. \r\n\r\nAs seen in the photo, Ajat is the one who is sitting and holding a Mapan poster. He is thankful for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1813941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to process more mobile payment services for his community.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bogor Selatan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-02-13T23:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-15T23:40:16Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ajat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":22000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":22000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-15T00:24:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":839282,"name":"Balimayaton Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madou est l'homme qui a tendu sa main vers le b\u0153uf sur la photo.\nMadou est Malien, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 43 ans, mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de 9 enfants dont 5 vont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, leurs Age varie entre 1 \u00e0 5 ans.

Nouhoum has had this business for more than 40 years and he encounters certain challenges such as lack of water, price fluctuation due to overproduction, which causes the market value of his crops to decrease."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":1813574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds and other products for gardening","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Nonsombougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":438,"posted_date":"2015-02-13T23:40:25Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-15T23:40:25Z","loan_amount":3275,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nouhoun","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdoulaye N'golo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kass\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fal\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"N'golo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moriba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nanssan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1875000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1875000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2383.33,"local_amount":1364500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:41:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1370366.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696724510},{"amount":891.67,"local_amount":510500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T18:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":512694.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711656103}],"funded_date":"2015-02-24T19:28:26Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T18:19:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":834924,"name":"Jekafo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Djiki est l\u2019homme qui tient la corde de la vache en main sur la photo.

She has a secondary education and she works as a cleaning lady in a preschool.  In order to bring home an additional income, she and her husband are also involved in animal husbandry and agriculture.  They started in this field ten years ago with an initial capital of 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, Tilek now owns two cows, one horse and 15 sheep.  She also grows alfalfa and barley on two hectares of her own land and one hectare of leased land.  In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to purchase four foals.

She has a secondary education.  By nature, she is friendly, responsible and hardworking.  She has been working in animal husbandry for several years already, thus providing her family with its main source of income.  She started in this business six years ago and, thanks to her very hard work, she currently has two cows on her farm.  Her activity brings her a monthly income of about 8,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her farming business, Salamatkan has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to buy one calf and two sheep.  She is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further expand her farming business.  She also wants to gather hay and to save enough money to send her son to

He lives with his family, which is made up of his partner and their three children, who range from 8 to 13 years old.  His business idea was strengthened by his experience as an employee and his ability to save while he was working at a delicatessen in the town where he still lives, though in a different neighborhood.  He does his sales in cash from 8 to 6 in the afternoon because he wants to achieve his current goals, which are to improve the setup of his business to have a positive impact on his image and to achieve a better quality of life for his family.

Shaarkul has a college degree and works for the local Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology. In addition, for 23 years she has been growing farm crops and raising livestock. She started with 10,000 KGS. Thanks to Shaarkul's hard work, at present she owns a land plot of 3.15 ha [7.8 acres], where she annually grows sainfoin [a plant used for animal forage] and barley for sale. She also has two cows and five sheep and sells milk on a daily basis. Her monthly revenue reaches up to 10,000 KGS.

She has six children. She operates a retail business where she sells fruits and vegetables. She has been involved in this business for 16 years. Her business is located in a busy market and her primary customers are locals. She describes her biggest business challenge to be inadequate working capital.

Francis is known for being a hardworking and responsible woman determined to get ahead. Thanks to discipline and perseverance in her work (her only income source), she has achieved the goals and objectives she set for herself.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she is still striving to see her business improve. Her economic activity consists of selling assorted footwear in bulk as well as in retail, in a store at one of the local markets. She has 20 years of experience in this business and thanks to that, she has outlived so much competition both in quality and price. This has been one of her biggest challenges.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this loan is to increase her working capital and restock her business with leather shoes, sports shoes, tennis shoes, sandals and children's shoes. Right now, she wants to seize the 'back to school' moment when kids, teenagers and college students return to their classes and therefore there is a greater demand for the product.\r\n\r\nShe devotes about ten hours a day to her business selling her products, so that she can make more profits in the near future.\r\n\r\nFrancis thanks Kiva lenders for the help they provide to people of limited resources to have a decent job."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1814592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy footwear such as leather shoes, sports shoes, tennis shoes, sandals and children's shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2015-02-14T12:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-16T12:00:03Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francis Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alba Taboas Garcia","image":1683905}},{"id":833520,"name":"Th\u1ee9c","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs Th\u1ee9c operates a food stall selling\u00a0fish.

daughter. Garnik is a skilled and experienced driver, for many years he worked as a driver at different workshops and private companies, but the last seven years he has been fully engaged in farming and agriculture. Now he is already connoisseur in his farm affairs. \r\n\r\nIn his farm Garnik has cows, calves, bulls and sheep. His plot of land gives a perfect harvest of potatoes, tomatoes and cucumber. So milk, meat and some assortment of vegetables which Garnik sells at the city\u2019s wholesale market and mainly to re-sellers.

He is seeking a 13,000 PHP loan to get back his pawned ATM card.\r\n\r\nJosias Ruel wants to give his family a better life someday. He looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. \r\n\r\nCCT works to provide local communities with a trained labour force, equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness and providing decent shelter, food and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\nCCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers such as Levita before starting their daily work routine.

She sews clothes using a sewing machine or other stitching machine, and often does hand stitching of edges and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Eppie, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Eppie is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying it since the loan payment was being deducted every pay day.  She looks forward for your positive response and any coming amount from you will surely be of great help. She will also use the loan to get back her pawned ATM card.\r\n\r\nEppie hopes to give her child good and quality education. She meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1814096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To repurchase the ATM card that she pawned","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-02-14T14:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-16T14:40:05Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eppie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1941.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200748},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3882.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187031},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3882.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536059},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3882.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017275},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1941.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313726}],"funded_date":"2015-02-14T23:57:22Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":839687,"name":"Amalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amalia is 45 years old and married with three children.\r\n\r\nAmalia is in the agricultural business, farming sugar cane in the Philippines.

She is employed in a garment factory in Cavite, through the auspices of the Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative (CCT). Lilibeth works as a seamstress, sewing clothing according to the company or client\u2019s dictates. She uses a sewing machine and other stitching machines, as well as handstitching hems and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Lilibeth is meeting family expenses without access to savings or credit. Workers can become heavily indebted to money lenders, who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Lilibeth is asking for your assistance to help her circumvent loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT, and had no problem in repaying them, since the loan payments were automatically deducted from her paycheck. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a 10,000 PHP loan to pay for her youngest child\u2019s tuition.\r\n\r\nLilibeth hopes to give her family a better life in the future. She looks forward to your positive response, and says any amount will surely be of great help. \r\n\r\nCCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force and equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\nCCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers such as Levita before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and after-work hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1814110,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay for the school fee of her youngest child.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-02-14T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-16T15:00:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilibeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2772.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200749},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2772.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187032},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2772.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536060},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2772.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017276}],"funded_date":"2015-02-14T15:26:13Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":839707,"name":"Raulina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raulina is 46 years old, residing at Pagadian City, Zamboanga del Sur, Philippines.

She uses a sewing machine and other stitching machines as well as handstitching hems and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Remilyn is meeting family expenses without access to savings or credit. Workers can become heavily indebted to money lenders who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason Remilyn is asking for your assistance to help her circumvent loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem in repaying them since the loan payments were automatically deducted from her paycheck. She is seeking an 8,000 PHP loan to pay for the rent for her house.\r\n\r\nRemilyn hopes to have her own business to earn additional income. She looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. \r\n\r\nCCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force and equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\nCCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers such as Levita before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and after-work hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1814123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for the rent on her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-02-14T15:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-16T15:40:06Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Remilyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2218.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200750},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2218.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187033},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2218.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536061},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2218.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017277}],"funded_date":"2015-02-14T19:25:48Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane  Slocombe","image":null}},{"id":839712,"name":"Analyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Analyn is 35 years old, married and has four children, one of whom is in school.\r\n\r\nAnalyn is in the agricultural business, raising pigs in the Philippines.

Gulmairam now has three cows and five sheep.  She also has 0.3 ha of land, although she does not currently plant anything there.  Her monthly income amounts to 25,000 som (KGS), but this is tragically too little to provide a decent life for her children or herself.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, Gulmairam's goal is to develop her business and she has applied to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) to buy four heifers.

She and her husband are raising four children.  Aigul has a secondary level education.  It's very difficult to find work in her village, but she still has to support her family and raise the children.  So, six years ago she started an agriculture business and today has two cows and 20 sheep.  She also grows beans on 1.2 ha of land.  Aigul's monthly income amounts to 8,000 som (KGS) in total.  Her husband provides welding services and earns a monthly income of about 6,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Aigul applied to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy two calves and 20 sheep to increase the size of her herd.  Aigul plans to invest the profits from her loan in accumulating additional cattle."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":165,"image":{"id":1811642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She uses a sewing machine and other stitching machines as well as handstitching hems and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Ma. Lina is meeting family expenses without access to savings or credit. Workers can become heavily indebted to money lenders who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason Ma. Lina is asking for your assistance to help her circumvent loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem in repaying them since the loan payments were automatically deducted from her paycheck. She is seeking a 12,000 PHP loan to pay for her children\u2019s tuition.\r\n\r\nMa. Lina hopes to give her children a good education. She also dreams to have her own tailoring shop. She looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. \r\n\r\nCCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families.

Alice has sustained herself through this line of work for seven years, and enjoys the farming lifestyle. She has a connection with farm animals that goes deep, to the extent that she names each of them. She hopes to expand her dairy farm but due to financial constraints has been unable to do this until now. Alice has requested a loan for Kes. 50,000 to buy a high-yielding dairy cow. This cow will boost milk production on the farm and she will have more to consume and sell. With the money from the additional sales, she will also be able to pay her loan on time. Many farmers compromise quality because of the high cost of supplies, but with a greater income, Alice will not have to take such measures and her family will enjoy an improved standard of living."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":271.34,"image":{"id":1814218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-14T20:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-16T20:00:06Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.51,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.01,"local_amount":7364.86,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":7423.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459797},{"amount":83.07,"local_amount":7665.39,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:33Z","rounded_local_amount":7725.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.25,"payment_id":696587879},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":6206.66,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":6255.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.61,"payment_id":731023002},{"amount":37.09,"local_amount":3430.88,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3458,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.65,"payment_id":752111162}],"funded_date":"2015-02-20T01:54:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":839775,"name":"Rehema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehema is married with four school-going children.

He lives with his pensioner grandmother and father, who is involved in a trading business. In particular, he buys fruits and vegetables at wholesale prices and sells them in his district with price mark-ups. The business is the only source of income for the family, and that is really hardly enough for making financial stability. <br \/><br \/>In order to give help to his father and improve the living condition of his family, Kako decided to start his own agricultural activity. He sought credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. <br \/><br \/>The startup program that is joint initiative between Kiva and Credo enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses.
