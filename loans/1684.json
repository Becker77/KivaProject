She is married to Richard, a stevedore, and has three children. Only one of her children goes to school.  She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs and to send her child to school. \r\n\r\nJessica operates a small variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. She earns money by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also grills and sells barbecue for added income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 700 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan, which she will use to buy grocery items such as a sack of rice, charcoal and soda as well as fresh meat for her barbecue sale. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her, for it will surely help fund their everyday needs and the schooling of her child.\r\n\r\nJessica hopes to maintain and grow her business so they can have a better life. She prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1814268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Meet Cecilia, a 27-year-old, very hardworking, honest, and ever smiling mother of 4 children. \r\n\r\nShe lives with her husband in the lush hills of Nandi hills, in the rift valley region of Kenya. \r\n\r\nCecilia passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past eight years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding the large family she has requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops and a personal business that she does in order to provide food for her large family. \r\n\r\nIn farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. Cecilia has a free space in her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices in the recent past have been going up, so Cecilia, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learned that she will not only get milk from the cow, but also manure and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nCecilia said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural based loans and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis. \r\n\r\nShe underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo and from the training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. \r\n\r\nCecilia hopes that with the additional profits she will be able to start adding value to her business by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. \r\n\r\nThis loan will change her life and will secure the future of her 4 school-going children.

district. She is a drug shop operator who works 12 hours a day. She started this business on July 15, 2013 to generate an income and treat the local population which was in need in her area. She was referred to UGAFODE by one of the institution\u2019s clients and so this is her first loan from UGAFODE. <br \/><br \/>She has applied for a loan of UGX 5,000,000 to purchase construction materials for her building which is under construction, where she will transform the drug shop to enlarge it into a bigger clinic. She hopes to have a good and standard medical facility around the Kambuzi area to treat the sick who are mostly her clients.

On the average, they are 31 years of age, with two children. They all live in Kalaban Koulouba, a neighborhood in the city of Bamako, and know each other as neighbors as well as through their work as vendors at the Kalaban market. The group members sell cosmetics (hair extensions, incense burners etc), second-hand clothing, shallots, onions and smoked fish. With the goal of bolstering their working capital, the group members have decided to join Soro Yiriwaso and are on their first solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nMrs. Awa (the one standing on the far left in the photo) is well known as a vendor selling best-quality hair extensions at the Kalaban market. She plans to use her loan to buy five bags of hair extensions in Bamako. She sells retail in Kalaban, mainly to female customers. With this loan, Mrs. Awa anticipates earning an average monthly revenue of 40,000 francs, which will be used for some everyday household needs. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1812439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy hair extensions for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2015-02-15T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-17T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"T\u00e9nin           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"T\u00e9nin           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pama          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:46:23Z","rounded_local_amount":151858.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624543083},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":151858.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636516120},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-31T12:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":151858.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649788399},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-11T12:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":151858.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":668301186}],"funded_date":"2015-02-15T02:32:55Z","paid_date":"2015-07-11T12:10:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":839855,"name":"Gjeline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gjeline, a villager and mother of three, wants your financial help to buy a dairy cow and register the land she owns in the cadaster (a public registry).

She has a degree in physical therapy. \r\n\r\nSince Karina left the university, it has been difficult to find a job that recognizes her capabilities and good service \u2013 which is why she specialized as an aesthetician. She worked for two years at Est\u00e9tica Tatiana Jim\u00e9nez (a beauty clinic) and one year at Stetik Center (a health spa). \r\n\r\nAfter poor working experiences, she decided to provide her services at home and with the help of her mother she bought part of the equipment and various offerings \u2013 including therapy consultations, permanent eyeliner, massages, permanent eyebrows, cleansing facials and waxing in different areas of the body. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she has a hot and cold press, hair removal equipment, sapphire tips, a wax heater and a somewhat old portable stretcher. \r\n\r\nBy having her therapy license, she obtains the products at an affordable price and is given a good discount on the equipment. So, she wants to take advantage and buy it as soon as possible in order to provide a quality service. Four years ago, she finished her degree at the university and since then has been working in the field she studied and has implemented new and improved techniques. \r\n\r\nHer small business has a good market. The majority are employed members of the community and surrounding areas. She wants to expand her area of service, now that she has a vehicle and can transport what she needs to any place. She ensures that the services she provides are always necessary or routine for her clients. She says that she has no competition because no one works as well and as affordably as her. She differentiates herself from other aestheticians because she has a college degree and has experience in the line of work. \r\n\r\nKatina says that she is very conscious of the environment, as she uses plant-based pigments and separates the waste and discarded chemicals in the land or sewage. She wants a loan in order to buy raw materials that will allow her to provide the best service with the right products, as well as achieve business growth and provide sustenance for her daughter. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":470.82,"image":{"id":1815368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy raw materials and equipment.

He lives with his wife and her family and doesn't have any significant income for covering even basic needs. The family only gets money from pensions and most members are temporarily unemployed, as in the region there is a high unemployment rate. <br \/>Zaza has just started work as an artisan's assistant and gets a really small salary. He has a great desire to purchase his own tools. These are necessary to do the work well, get costumers' loyalty, and start work on his own. Zaza needs financial support to realize his plans and requested a loan to local financial institutions.

Hace 10 a\u00f1os, motivada por su hija Raquel, inici\u00f3 con la venta de antojitos en un local ubicado sobre la calle principal y m\u00e1s transitada del municipio. La primera semana de ventas fue dif\u00edcil porque otros tres comenrciantes iniciaron con el mismo negocio, sin embargo, el servicio al cliente, la variedad de antojitos y su saz\u00f3n es lo que ha hecho que su negocio sea productivo.

Some of them also plant corn, beans, and pumpkins, mainly for their own consumption but in some cases to sell.\r\n\r\nThe group's name references the essential right to be at peace and it symbolizes tranquility for each of their businesses. Currently, the group includes: Dora (agrochemicals); Griselda, Raquel (snacks); Mar\u00eda Francisca (handicrafts); Erika (sweets); Josefa, Jos\u00e9 (groceries); Claudia (American clothing); Yolanda (chickens); Leyla (fried foods & corn on the cob); Mar\u00eda (napkins); Ang\u00e9lica (pork cracklings); and Lorena (clothing, by catalog).\r\n\r\nEveryone knows Griselda as la G\u00fcera [the blonde]. She is the mother of 6 children, of whom only one still depends on her economically. Griselda became a mother when she was 14 years old, and from then on, she has confronted and overcome too many obstacles.\r\n\r\nTen years ago, motivated by her daughter Raquel, she started selling snacks from a location on the high-traffic main street of the city. The first week of sales was tough because three other sellers started the same business, but good customer service, a variety of snacks, and her seasoning have made her business successful. Also, Griselda works 2 shifts each day -- from 7am to 2pm she sells snacks, and from 6 to 8pm she sells tacos and sandwiches -- so she sees higher earnings.\r\n\r\nShe has used all of her loans to purchase supplies to make her snacks, soda, gas, chairs, tables, tablecloths, plates, glasses, and some changes to her locations. \"Thanks to each of the loans that have been given to me, I have succeeding in growing my business.

She learned this activity from the time she was young, because her parents did this type of work her whole life. Maria is very happy and satisfied since with the financial help with her first loan, financed by the COMIXMUL cooperative in alliance with the Kiva platform.  she was able to buy different materials to do maintenance and care on her coffee crops. For example, weeding, applying fertilizer, foliar sprays and more. At the end of the harvest, she obtained excellent results selling the beans to intermediaries, receiving the capital she hoped for to be able to get ahead with her payment commitment. Right now, her crops are a little deteriorated since by harvesting the beans the plan is damaged and it is weak and exposed. That is why she is asking for a second loan to invest in buying fertilizer and in weeding the crops, preparing the soil, and more, to help the yield and to expand the business. Her family is very big, made up of 6 children, 2 of whom are in primary school. She wants to keep supporting them so that they can graduate.

unemployment and lack of capital. This is true for Beatrice, 33, who is based in the Siongiroi area of Kenya and is an adorable mother. She has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years, and she has managed to earn a decent income.<br \/><br \/>Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops, and some personal businesses she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated, \u201cFeeding my cows.\u201d <br \/><br \/>Her hobby is milking. She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet it. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow; it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will produce between 10-15 litres of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit and increased income levels.  Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. <br \/><br \/>Beatrice is very ambitious. In the near future she intends to start adding value to her milk business by packaging the milk before selling, and she also plans to start selling dairy products such as yogurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":367.52,"image":{"id":1814395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-15T04:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-17T04:40:04Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.85,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.2,"local_amount":4373.51,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4508.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601293},{"amount":44.06,"local_amount":3916.38,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4037.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459804},{"amount":55.72,"local_amount":4992.51,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5146.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.45,"payment_id":681378190},{"amount":50.86,"local_amount":4589.17,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4730.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.77,"payment_id":696587885},{"amount":51.32,"local_amount":4768.8,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4915.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.33,"payment_id":711506170},{"amount":56.31,"local_amount":5126.53,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5284.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.36,"payment_id":731023008},{"amount":54.2,"local_amount":4900.98,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5051.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.94,"payment_id":752111165}],"funded_date":"2015-02-15T14:03:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":839935,"name":"Mbeyu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mbeyu is a married woman and has been blessed with four children, all of whom attend school.

Whereby a kilo of green tea leaves was at 500 UGX, now it\u2019s at 200 UGX for coffee and tea trade but for cattle and goats trade he is faced with a challenge of diseases that attack the livestock and they end up dying. \r\n\r\nHe hopes to buy a car to transport his tea leaves from the tea plantation to the tea factories around. He thanks UGAFODE Microfinance for the financial support that he has got from the institution and promises to be a good paying client so as to get another loan in the near future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1814167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers and goats","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ishaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.543056 30.136944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2015-02-15T04:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-17T04:40:05Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":44.61,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T12:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":251559.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636759205},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-25T12:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":251559.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":651655167},{"amount":83.72,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-26T12:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":251559.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.78,"payment_id":668716304},{"amount":83.48,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":251559.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.02,"payment_id":681546088},{"amount":78.17,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":251559.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.33,"payment_id":696786078},{"amount":75.81,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-24T12:19:20Z","rounded_local_amount":251559.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.69,"payment_id":714046724},{"amount":76.97,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-23T12:13:59Z","rounded_local_amount":251559.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.53,"payment_id":732673501},{"amount":82.24,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-22T13:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":251559.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.26,"payment_id":754866336}],"funded_date":"2015-03-17T01:58:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":839925,"name":"Noyaa Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These ladies are part of the Noyaa group of four women who are all merchants and live in the same neighborhood.

He does not want to postpone his dream for much longer. It is now up to you to help him out. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":233.28,"image":{"id":1812452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy equipment and supplies for opening a diner.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jilikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"37.493611 68.531111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-02-15T05:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-17T05:40:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.08,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahmadraim ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":142.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":140.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":147.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":147.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":161.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":162.04},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":166.56},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":175.9},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":177.43},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":188.37},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":193.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":196.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.64},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.98},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.32},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.29},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.32,"local_amount":142.56,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:41:09Z","rounded_local_amount":144.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.41,"payment_id":636348968},{"amount":24.89,"local_amount":140.74,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:11:13Z","rounded_local_amount":142.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.5,"payment_id":649621499},{"amount":26.24,"local_amount":147.74,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":149.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.46,"payment_id":665101472},{"amount":26.18,"local_amount":147.43,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":149,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.46,"payment_id":681399584},{"amount":28.54,"local_amount":161.2,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":162.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.69,"payment_id":696609656},{"amount":28.27,"local_amount":162.04,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":163.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.11,"payment_id":711525683},{"amount":28.29,"local_amount":166.56,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":168.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.94,"payment_id":731041449},{"amount":29.47,"local_amount":175.9,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:05:46Z","rounded_local_amount":177.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.51,"payment_id":752130420}],"funded_date":"2015-02-17T03:10:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":839952,"name":"Fatmeh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatmeh is a Lebanese widowed woman living with her five children.

","en":"Los Azares is the name of this group made up of responsible, hardworking people who are committed to their family and their well-being.\r\n\r\nThey live in a sugarcane producing region which is home to one of most important \"ingenios\" (sugar mills) in the country. During the harvest, a reactivation of the economy can be seen thanks to the income received by the workers. It is during these six months that the members of Los Azares take advantage by making bigger investments in each of their work activities:\r\n\r\nEulogio - beauty salon stylist; Juana - homemade food eatery; Irma - cosmetics; Maria - american clothing; Miriam - food;  Griselda - chicken; Felisa - catalog shoes; Marisela - clothing.\r\n\r\nEulogio is known to all as Gio. Having reached one of his dreams, becoming a beauty salon stylist for which he studied, he now offers his services from the convenience of his home. He set up a small space that remains open from Sunday to Saturday and from 10 am to 7 pm. Gio also works attending clients in their own home.\r\n\r\nGio comments that he decided to go independent and set up his own salon fifteen years ago, after working for a prestigious salon where he learned a great deal about his work. Nowadays, his work speaks for him, and his stability is due to his successul results. He was invited by the committee that organizes the patron saint celebrations in his commmunity, to take part in the event by offering his services.\r\n\r\nGio needs to invest in haircolors, peroxides, conditioners, scissors, combs, and hair caps. \r\n\r\nWith his profits, he pays the rent of the home where he lives and covers his personal expenses, as well as investing in his small beauty salon.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to everyone who makes it possible for us to receive the loans, with these our work activities have grown stronger, generating better income.\"\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken in Juana's eatery. Every fourteen days, the members meet to make their loan payments. Gio is wearing a black and gold shirt.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":1815543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy haircolors, peroxides, conditioners, scissors, combs, and hair caps.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Motzorongo, Tezonapa, Ver.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-02-15T15:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-17T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":3500,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eulogio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Griselda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felisa Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maricela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":6527.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423909},{"amount":1312.5,"local_amount":19500,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":19583.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769244},{"amount":875,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":13055.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649764002},{"amount":875,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":13055.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597527}],"funded_date":"2015-02-17T16:09:04Z","paid_date":"2015-06-18T13:25:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":840133,"name":"Janice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janice faces considerable preparation for the post-harvest operations of her corn farm in Siloy, Misamis Occidental.

Elbira Senaida sells seafood, fruits and vegetables; Nidia has a small corner store; and Marlene Rebeca sells used clothing.\r\n\r\nA previous PANA PANA loan, financed by KIVA lenders, helped Elbira Senaida add fruits and vegetables to the mix of seafood products that she has long sold.

She was born and raised in Puerto Cabezas.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  She has worked as a street vendor for 11 years, selling all kinds of seafood.  She has a cart with an ice chest and her earnings from the business go to household expenses and her children's schooling.  She is applying for a loan that she will use to buy seafood products from local fishermen and divers: fish, shrimp, prawns, etc.  The loan is a good investment because seafood is a basic staple of the local diet.

Maaruf was born in a rural area. He has been raising farm crops for over 15 years. At first he worked in his neighbors field, took care of livestock and grew garden vegetables. Eventually Maaruf has saved up to buy fruit and vegetables seeds for planting on his own land. Maaruf worked day and night fertilizing the soil and removing weeds. At present he has a large land plot, where he grows potatoes, carrots and other fruits and vegetables. All harvested produce is brought to the market for sale. Maaruf would like to buy seeds and fertilizers but is short of the full amount necessary. This is why he has applied to the Arvand microfinance institution for financial support. Maaruf hopes that Arvand will respond to his plea and grant him the loan for the amount still needed.

She manages to save 6 USD a day for her family's future needs.\r\n\r\nPhina is a longtime member with VisionFund, Kiva\u2019s partner. It is her ninth cycle, and she is seeking a loan of 1,600,000 KHR. Her portion of the loan will be used to buy fertilizer, insecticide, and rice seed for her rice farm and vegetable plantation as well as to hire workers to look after the plantations. She hopes that it will financially help her family and allow her children to receive an education.

and Informatics. Here is his story:\r\n\r\n\u201cEducation, health and ability to help other people are of vital importance for my family. My father is a Police Officer and my mother is a scientific employee of the National center of Cardiology and Therapy. They receive small salaries as they are the workers of the budgetary sphere, but they are glad to spend all their time, from morning to evening, at work carrying out their duties and helping people. My parents are exemplary people and I would like to be like them.\r\n\r\nMy family doesn\u2019t have other sources of revenue or business. We live modestly; we don\u2019t have a car and don\u2019t buy expensive clothes. As my parents were always budgetary workers, they're used to saving money and living within their means. I know that in the Western countries or in the USA, budgetary employees earn good money and they are respected, unfortunately, that is quite the contrary here. Even so, we consider my parents\u2019 jobs the most important ones and I am glad to be their son, as thanks to them people are healthy, there is a peace in my city, and people become tolerant and well-bread.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in the seventh form, I knew exactly that I would enter AUCA. Here the studies are conducted in English, which opens big opportunities and prospects in the future. High aspiration to a goal, intellectual development, independence, strong convictions, democracy, adherence to principles \u2013 the qualities inherent for the most AUCA students. AUCA is my long-term goal, but it can\u2019t be achieved without money. \r\n\r\nCertainly, we don\u2019t have the possibility to pay the full tuition of AUCA, which why I hope that Kiva lenders will give me a chance to study here and get a Bachelors Degree.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1814846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education
