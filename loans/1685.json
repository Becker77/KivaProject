Her older sons live abroad because they could not find work in the country.  6 years ago, Orustamo started a business raising cattle in her own yard.  She owns cows, which she milks to provide her family with dairy products.  She also sells the milk and cream, and with the help of this business is improving her family's standard of living.  Orustamo wants to increase the size of her herd, and is asking for a loan to buy cows.  Your support will help her to buy a cow and improve her business.

She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment and the financial help that will be given to her, for it will surely help fund the family's everyday needs and the schooling needs of their children.\r\n\r\nAnelyn hopes to maintain and grow her business to improve their quality of life.

children.  For family reasons, Zokirjon was unable to finish school and instead began working to help his parents with money.  Zokirjon got a job at a construction site and also worked in sales at the local market.  Zokirjon could not go to university because his parents couldn not afford to pay his tuition.  For this reason, Zokirjon decided to continue his father's business, and started raising cattle.  He now has on his plot of land three cows and five sheep.  His wife helps him with the business - she milks the cows and takes the milk to the market to sell.  Zokirjon plans to purchase feed for his cattle, but he does not have the full amount of money needed.  For this reason he turned to MDO Arvand for financial support.  Zokirjon hopes that MDO Arvand will deliver the needed funds.

married, and has one son.  Batima has a secondary education.  Batima's work in animal husbandry and farming, beginning 19 years ago with 4,000 KGS, serves as an additional source of income for her family.  Thanks to Batima's hard work, she now has 1 cow, 1 horse, and 27 sheep.  Her monthly income is about 22,000 KGS.  In addition, Batima sews bridles for horses, which she sells at the cattle market once a week, usually selling about 10 bridles each time.  On her 1.80 hectare plot of land she also raises beans to sell.  With the goal for further expanding her business, Batima turned to the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan of 150,000 KGS to purchase 2 calves and 20 sheep to increase the size of her herd.  With the income from the loan, Batima plans to save toward the further development of her

Meet Viola, from the Messut, Molo area of Kenya. Molo is an area where the earth is red and smells fresh from the rain. The trees are lush. For the past years Viola has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, vegetables, and some personal business she engages in to make extra cash. Viola has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She passionately loves dairy farming. \u201cCows are part of me. I love cows, I walk cows, I sleep cows, I eat cows,\u201d she says. The village women call her Mrs. Cow. She sells milk to her neighbours and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet the demand. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. <br \/><br \/>The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow. It\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10-20 litres of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit margin and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used to repay the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. Viola is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future she will start adding value to her milk business by packaging the milk before selling.

She has two daughters who are 38 and 24 years old.  They are both married and have children of their own.  Her oldest daughter currently lives abroad.  Davlatbi raises livestock and has been involved in this activity for more than 10 years.

Since his boyhood, Tuychiboy has been involved in animal husbandry. At the beginning he helped his parents on the field, took care of livestock, and also picked vegetables and fruits from the field and sold them at a market. Since then Tuychiboy expanded his father's business by buying several heads of livestock. His wife helps him with all the business. Tuychiboy understands that he has to work hard in order to feed his large family. Tuychiboy plans to purchase livestock feed, but does not have enough money. This is why he came to MDO Arvand for the financial support. He hopes that MDO Arvand will respond to his request to obtain a loan and disburse the needed sum. He is grateful in advance for the support and

She is married to Manuel, an ice cream vendor, and has four children of whom two are in college, one in high school and the youngest is in the elementary Level. She and her husband work hard to provide for their everyday needs and the school needs of their children.\r\n\r\nMinda sells one of the curious street foods in the Philippines called \u201cdirty ice cream\u201d(sorbetes\/sorbet). It is real homemade creamy ice cream made from local fruits. The unique ingredient in sorbetes is coconut milk and when it is sold on the streets, the customer has a choice between putting the ice cream in a bread bun or on a small wafer cone.\r\n\r\nThe common flavors of dirty ice cream are cheese, mango, ube, and chocolate. Its history began during the American occupation of the Philippines where American ice cream made in Philippines used water buffalo\u2019s milk instead of cow\u2019s milk. Water buffalo\u2019s milk was cheaper and easily available. Peddlers of \"dirty ice cream\" do not have a permanent stand. They walk around the streets and can also be hired for private parties. As to why it is called dirty ice cream \u2013 this was a mother\u2019s warning to a child against buying street food that may not be safe to eat. The government however has stepped in and made sure that the vendors practice good sanitation and hygiene. \r\n  \r\nTo help her continue with her  business, Minda would like to apply for a Php 40,000 loan which she will use to pay for carts of ice cream that she and husband peddle in their community. Adults and kids alike enjoy eating ice cream any time of the day. Even foreigners who have tasted the ice cream claim that it is a great afternoon treat. For the children on the street, the tiny tinkling of the bell is like music to their ears as they know the \"sorbetero\" is near. Minda and her husband earn a minimum of 2,000 PHP a day in sales.\r\n\r\nMinda aims to grow her business and put up a mini-grocery store someday. She aims to send all her children to college and dreams to see them become professionals. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1815010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Norah is the proud mother of lovely children that she really loves and adores and always protects. \r\n\r\nNorah\u2019s upbringing was very challenging and because of this she promised herself that she would work hard and get out of the poverty situation. That is why she started farming 10 years ago and through farming she has been able to earn a decent income. Norah is the breadwinner in her family and this really pushes her to work hard so that her children will have a bright future and also her parents will have a comfortable life.\r\n\r\nNorah is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming so that she can use the excess space on her land. She dreams of buying more land and increasing her horticulture business. Accessing funds is very difficult for a woman in Africa but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, Norah is optimistic that her dream will be realized and her life will completely change.

He also has five cows that he's feeding so that, when they're producing milk, he can make dairy products to have a source of income and to improve his children's nutrition.\r\n\r\nHe needs the loan to buy a dairy cow to make cheese to sell.  The price tends to go up this time of year and he hopes to improve his income by selling dairy products.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to keep on growing basic grains to feed his children.  He also wants to buy more cattle in the future so he can improve his income little by little."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1816875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-02-16T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-18T15:20:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":234.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":244.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":254.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":265.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.97},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":265.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":201.1,"local_amount":201.1,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":201.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666803925},{"amount":34.55,"local_amount":34.55,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":34.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683484039},{"amount":246.82,"local_amount":246.82,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":246.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711455323},{"amount":517.53,"local_amount":517.53,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:34:19Z","rounded_local_amount":517.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752063407}],"funded_date":"2015-03-17T20:42:15Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:34:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":840432,"name":"Yoen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yoen is aged 53 years and married with eight children.

established her business. She was able to purchase additional frozen goods and meat products, which were needed to increase her product inventory. The loan also helped her to provide the educational expenses of her children and pay for their daily needs.\r\n\r\nMatimtiman is very positive that she can improve her business if you will lend her an amount of 25,000 PHP. This new loan will be used to purchase additional meat and frozen products. Her customers will likely buy more items if she has more of her products displayed in her store. An increase in sales will also result in a significant increase in profit, which will also help her business to become viable and sustainable. Simultaneously, she could sustain the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nAside from growing her business, Matimtiman hopes that her family will have a better life someday. She is pretty sure that if she gives the best for her children's education, their lives will become more improved and successful. She meets every week with her *co-fellowship members to share stories of her work and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

common thinking among Kenyans that agriculture is for the older generation. She is a loving mother who has been farming for the last ten years so that she can supplement her income. \r\n\r\nSusan farms crops and keeps cattle and she enjoys farming a lot. Her biggest challenges are diseases and the lack of finances to improve her farming, which has caused her to seek a loan of KES 20,000 to purchase sheep. Her projections are that, by the end of the year, these sheep will have given birth to at least four other sheep. Through sheep-keeping, Susan will be able to get sheep wool, which is very expensive and fetches more profits. This translates into more income and improved living conditions for her family. Also, Susan will be able to sell sheep meat and sheepskin, which will increase her income. The profits will be used to repay the loan on time and to grow the business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":143.8,"image":{"id":1815122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality breed of sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-16T18:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-18T18:00:04Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.05,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.46,"local_amount":1551.88,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1598.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265158},{"amount":16.75,"local_amount":1488.97,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1533.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601299},{"amount":17.3,"local_amount":1537.41,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1583.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459812},{"amount":17.79,"local_amount":1594.37,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1642.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.15,"payment_id":681378197},{"amount":16.94,"local_amount":1528.55,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1574.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.26,"payment_id":696587893},{"amount":18.03,"local_amount":1676.51,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1726.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.83,"payment_id":711506176},{"amount":18.09,"local_amount":1648.17,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1697.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.45,"payment_id":731023016},{"amount":19.39,"local_amount":1755.21,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1808.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.36,"payment_id":752111170}],"funded_date":"2015-02-17T17:12:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":840495,"name":"Maychel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maychel, 25 years old, is married and has one child.

Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and crops. Ann is seeking a loan to expand her horticulture farm. Her biggest challenge over the years as a farmer has been the lack of adequate capital. It is very hard for small farmers to save enough capital for expansion, since farming is marred with all sorts of external risks, such as climatic conditions, pests and diseases, political instability, fluctuation of prices and high costs of inputs. Because of these factors, the sure way farmers can obtain adequate capital is through leveraging their businesses. With your loan investment, Ann is going to expand her horticultural farm in order to increase its output.

Mercy, an enterprising 25-year-old farmer from the Salama, Nandihills area of Kenya, chose the latter. She is a hardworking and energetic farmer. For the past five years, she has been a farmer, gaining a lot of practical experience in doing so. With her farming income, she has always assured her family of a decent meal and other basic needs. \r\n\r\nMercy is now applying for a 30,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy another posho mill (which grinds maize grain) that is more reliable and stronger. The Salama, Nandihills area is served by only one diesel posho mill (operated by Mercy) that keeps breaking down. With the loan, she will be able to offer a solution to the people in her area. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Mercy feels relieved knowing there are institutions, such as Kiva, that help enterprising women like her. She is very disciplined with her finances and hopes that through her accumulated profits, she will be able to improve her living conditions and also secure the future of her children.

married with four children. She got married right after finishing school and worked only on domestic chores. Her husband works as a taxi driver and it was hard for him to provide for both his parents and his family. Therefore Zebojon decided to start her own business. She used her savings to rent a space at the market and started selling vegetables. Now she has a lot of customers who shop specifically in her store. Her oldest daughter helps her with everything. Despite this, it has become difficult for Zebojon, because besides the work at the market, she has to keep up with work at home, too. \r\n\r\nIn the near future, Zebojon plans to expand her business by buying goods for sale, but she doesn't have the full amount of money. Therefore she has turned to Arvand for financial

He has been running the van as a loader and cargo transport business as well. He has had his own van for the past 12 years. \r\n\r\nDue to excessive and continuous use, the van needs some maintenance, so he has decided to repair his van as soon as possible. But due to lack of finances, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairs. Therefore, Sakina has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing his van.

She is hopeful that an increase in milk production will help her in generating more income.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":321.09,"image":{"id":1814319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase another buffalo","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Mandi Bhauddin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2015-02-16T20:40:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-18T20:40:22Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ghazala  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3135},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3235},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3339},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3446},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3556},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3670},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3787},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3908},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4033},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4162},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4296},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4433}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.56},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.7},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.96},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.6,"local_amount":2560,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:15:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2594.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624266995},{"amount":38.1,"local_amount":3810,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3860.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636269569},{"amount":33.39,"local_amount":3339,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3383.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649605717},{"amount":34.46,"local_amount":3446,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3491.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665084962},{"amount":35.56,"local_amount":3556,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:56:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3603.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681382628},{"amount":36.7,"local_amount":3670,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:50:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3718.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696592840},{"amount":37.87,"local_amount":3787,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3837.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711511352},{"amount":79.41,"local_amount":7941,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":8046.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752116423}],"funded_date":"2015-02-24T06:05:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":840595,"name":"Farzana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farzana along with her husband has successfully built her business of a general store with the support of Kashf Foundation and Kiva.

He is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in his village because of his resilience despite personal challenges and his passion to support his children as a primary caregiver. The living conditions in the Siongiroi area are very tough and you need to have tough skin in order to survive. John has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. Because of the hardcore poverty in his village, John started practicing mixed farming and has been doing it for the past 10 years. John's sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg selling; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, and one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. The Siongiroi area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. That is why John is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike.\r\n\r\nWith the motorbike, he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh.

and his family. He is a hardworking man and aggressive with the principle of truth on his lips; he is honest and faithful to what he does and what he says. The Cheptuiget area has hardcore poverty which pervades every homestead, yet every day when you look beyond the numbers, you will see bright, vibrant, open faces of young people searching and yearning for the opportunity to live a life of dignity and respect. They have the conviction that it\u2019s possible. \r\n\r\nDaniel has kept hope and has been toiling on his farm for the past 15 years. His primary sources of income have been milk, poultry and some \u201cside hustles\u201d he does to supplement the meager income he earns from farming. The Cheptuiget area has few diesel posho mills that serve a sea of people but the mills keeps breaking down, hence farmers are not able to grind their maize. Daniel intends to change this and is requesting a loan to buy an electric posho mill which will grind corn or maize into flour.\r\n\r\nMaize meal is very common in Kenya and is a staple food for many communities. Many Kenyan families consume the maize product \u201cugali\u201c (hard porridge) regularly. The market usually provides sifted flour, but the cost is higher because of the sifting and packaging. Cheaper flour can be obtained by milling the maize directly using a posho mill. Through this loan, Daniel will be able to grind maize faster because he will use an electric posho mill. Cases of breakdown will be long-ago history because electric posho mills are more reliable. \r\n\r\nThis loan will assist Daniel in permanently changing his life and achieving his life mission of driving economic development. Profits from the posho mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan, which Daniel promises to fully repay on time. In the next two years, Daniel sees himself as a very established businessman who will be running more than one posho mill in his remote village. Daniel patiently waits for your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":264.06,"image":{"id":1815329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy an electric posho mill","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-16T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-18T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.66,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":92.19,"local_amount":8380.56,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":8441.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459818},{"amount":39.23,"local_amount":3621.49,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3647.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.61,"payment_id":696587899},{"amount":40.89,"local_amount":3889.51,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3917.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.89,"payment_id":711506179},{"amount":87.09,"local_amount":8113.74,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":8172.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.16,"payment_id":731023022}],"funded_date":"2015-03-17T14:11:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":840616,"name":"Dorcas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorcas is married and has school-going children.

He is happily married, and together with his beautiful wife they are blessed with a beautiful family. For the past 10 years he has been involved in mixed farming and because of the immense knowledge he has in farming, farmers from his village and neighboring villages troop to his home to seek technical advice on the best farming techniques. \r\n\r\nHis primary source of income has been milk, eggs, maize, and some personal businesses he engages in to make the extra income. Justus sells cereals to his neighbors and to the local market and makes more money ,although his work is not without challenges he says, though he is regarded as the best cereal seller in his village. He has been unable to meet the market demand which has resulted in a loss of tenders. One of his neighbors ordered 100 bags of maize which he was unable to supply. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan to buy more cereals so that he can satisfy the demand. He intends to buy different varieties of cereals such as millet, rice, sorghum and maize. Through Juhudi Kilimo, which is a micro finance that supports small scale farmers, Justus is confident that this loan will permanently change his life. Increased profits from cereal selling will allow him to afford his highest monthly expenses; farm related comforts and the ability to channel a surplus amount to his children's education. Justus is a visionary and plans to buy a maize-milling machine through accumulated profits."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":227.85,"image":{"id":1815338,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-16T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-18T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.35,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.28,"local_amount":4910.13,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5245.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265164},{"amount":53.25,"local_amount":4564.4,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4875.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459819},{"amount":55.81,"local_amount":4858.74,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5190.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.88,"payment_id":696587900},{"amount":59.16,"local_amount":5196.93,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5551.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.47,"payment_id":731023023}],"funded_date":"2015-03-15T14:12:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":840597,"name":"Farzana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farzana is 35 years old and married.

His half-acre of land, located in the Nyamira area of Kenya, houses poultry and dairy cows. Thomas passionately loves poultry farming. The Nyamira area is populated, and has a ready market for poultry products. Poultry farming is one of the profitable business ventures in Kenya and you don\u2019t need to be a large-scale farmer to benefit from it. The demand for chicken is always high, being such a popular meal for many people as can be proved when you visit fast food joints in his area. \r\n\r\nHowever, with his biggest challenge being lack of funds, Thomas is kindly seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan, Thomas will be able to sell eggs, meat and poultry feathers to the already existing market. Even though he has been facing challenges accessing finances, he feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva are there to make his dream come true. \r\n\r\nThomas chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loans is low, and is on a reducing basis. He underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, learning that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Through the loan, Thomas' income will increase and his life will permanently change, leading to better living conditions for his family and a positive impact on the community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":251.4,"image":{"id":1815350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy additional poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-16T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-18T21:20:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.65,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2477.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2549.45},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2623.95},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2700.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2779.57},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2860.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2944.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.45},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3119.02},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3210.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3303.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3400.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.99},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.43,"local_amount":2749.89,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2877.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265165},{"amount":27.07,"local_amount":2368.99,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2479.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601301},{"amount":31.35,"local_amount":2743.16,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2870.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459820},{"amount":28.86,"local_amount":2548.27,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.26,"payment_id":681378200},{"amount":30.22,"local_amount":2685.55,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2810.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.47,"payment_id":696587901},{"amount":32.17,"local_amount":2945.21,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3082.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.49,"payment_id":711506180},{"amount":33.47,"local_amount":3001.33,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3140.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.83,"payment_id":731023024},{"amount":33.18,"local_amount":2955.91,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3093.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.6,"payment_id":752111173}],"funded_date":"2015-02-22T11:34:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":841593,"name":"D\u00fao Ester Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"DUO ESTER\nEste d\u00fao est\u00e1 formado por do\u00f1a Miriam de 30 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y tiene 4 hijos y desde hace 10 a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de le\u00f1a y  venta de refacciones, los fines de semana, ella necesita que la apoyen ya que quiere comprar una camionada de le\u00f1a de pino y encino, porque le est\u00e1n ofreciendo a buen precio y quiere que fape le pueda apoyar.desde ya les agradece su apoyo en su negocio.","en":"DUO ESTER\r\nMiriam, who belongs to this group, is 30 years old, married, and has four children.

municipality of San Francisco El Alto. San Francisco is known for its large conifer forests that encompass its rural communities, filling the air with the scent of pines and cypress. These communities are almost entirely indigenous Maya K\u2019iche, who in addition to raising animals and growing corn, beans, and other staple vegetables, are major producers of typical indigenous textiles and fabrics.\r\n \r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cFranica\u201d is made up of 10 women from one of San Francisco El Alto\u2019s rural communities. \u201cFrancia\u201d is an experienced group, with over half of the women returning for their fifth loan cycle or greater with Friendship Bridge.  Paulina is the most experienced member, returning to Friendship Bridge for her ninth loan cycle. As a veteran, Paulina uses her extensive knowledge to effectively lead and provide support for newer group members. Paulina has five years of business experience, owning and operating a small pharmacy, where she applies her knowledge as a nurse\u2019s assistant to treat community members with basic medicines. Paulina provides her community with health care, in a region where access is sparse. Paulina is applying for a loan to increase and improve her inventory of medicine in order to effectively care for her customers. With the continued success of her business, Paulina hopes to continue providing education for her young daughter, so that she can graduate from school with a degree and have a higher quality of life than her mother.

She is 49 years old. She is a kind woman and a single mother of six children: two teenagers who are in middle school and four who are in elementary school. Her children inspire her to continue working hard. For the past two years, she has made coconut bread in an artisanal oven as well as fried foods in her wooden stilt house. In this way, she earns her own income in order to cover household expenses and the cost of her children's education. She is requesting a loan to buy supplies and ingredients such as flour, yeast, oil, coconut, sugar, soda, filipitas (a banana variety), cabbage, tomatoes, vinegar, and chicken.

In our first report about the group, we told the story of Julia, the president of \u201cBella Vista.\u201d Julia, now in her sixth loan cycle with Friendship Bridge, continues to provide leadership and guidance to the other six members of the Trust Bank. Do\u00f1a Maria, a 56-year-old grandmother, is one of the newest members of the Trust Bank. Maria joined the group to continue to expand her bakery business. She is applying for a loan to buy ingredients, utensils, and cookware, to continue selling her popular breads, pastries, cakes and pizzas. Due to her expertise and the variety of goods that Maria offers, she has been able to expand her bakery business from her small storefront. Now, Maria sells her freshly baked goods all over San Pedro to small stores, reaching a wider range of customers. With this loan, Maria will be able to maintain her growing bakery business. Maria hopes to improve the quality of her bakery as well of the quality of her life with the support of this small loan.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cBella Vista,\u201d Julia would like to thank Kiva for the support and belief in the group. Without the support of Kiva, Julia and her Trust Bank would be without the opportunity to create a better future for themselves and their families.

Not only will Juan save money, but he will also protect the environment by treating the waste instead of letting it contaminate underground water sources. In addition, his wife will no longer cook using wood, which will drastically improve her health, as the toxic smoke is eliminated from the house. Juan will apply the organic fertilizer on his corn field, nourishing the soils and increasing their yield in a sustainable way. As his productivity increases and he saves money by displacing LP gas and chemical fertilizers, Juan plans to use his savings to buy more cows, improve the infrastructure of his farm and invest in his children's education.

Keila has had this business for 7 years, but according to what Keila states, the income that this business generates is not sufficient to support her family. It is for that reason that she also sells bread in the mornings, and in the afternoons she has this other business. Keila has managed to improve her income to raise her family. What she wants to accomplish now is to improve her business of selling gifts, but one of her limitations is that she doesn't have sufficient capital to be able to do it. For this reason, she is applying for a loan to buy gifts such as teddy bears, wall paintings, lamps, and other things.\r\n\r\nKeila is a highly participating woman who likes to collaborate with the others.
