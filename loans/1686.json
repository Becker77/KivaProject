in elementary school.  Ziyagul herself has a specialized secondary education and she works as a history teacher.  In order to bring an additional source of income home, she has been involved in animal husbandry for the past seven years.  Thanks to her determination and very hard work, she currently owns four cows and 20 sheep.  This business brings her and her family a good income of about 22,000 som (KGS).  However, Ziyagul raises her daughter alone, and the money she makes is not enough for a decent life.  For this reason, and in order to increase her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 20,000 som (KGS) to buy a calf.

She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are their source to meet their daily expenses and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nEmily hopes to maintain and grow her business so they can have a better quality of life. She prays for a quiet and happy life.

Their daughter is in high school.  Tia Concha has had access to loans through VisionFund Mexico for 15 years.  She used her first loan to raise sheep which was her main activity for ten years.  \"With my little sheep I was able to help my husband with the children's expenses.\"  Her earnings allowed her to open a small grocery store five years ago.  At first it was difficult because they had to build a warehouse for the merchandise and then they only could buy a few products.

When she was 14 years old, she went to live in the capital to look for better sources of income and she worked there doing domestic jobs in various households. She returned to her hometown when she was 20 years old and when she had her first child she decided to open a small store in her house and bit by bit the business grew. She has now had the business for 15 years and it is going well.\r\n\r\nCecilia needs the loan to repair the roof of her house because the supporting beams are old and rotten, so she wants to repair them before winter comes. She also wants to invest in the purchase of merchandise for her small store in order to satisfy client demand. \r\n\r\nCecilia's dream is to see her children grow up and become good people, her oldest child is studying communications at university and she hopes that this child of hers will become a model professional in the community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":323.22,"image":{"id":1817028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":" to repair the roof of her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-02-17T08:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-19T08:40:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":36.58},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":36.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":37.68},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":38.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":39.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":43.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":44.26},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":48.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.58},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.68},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.26},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.32,"local_amount":37.32,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:03:39Z","rounded_local_amount":37.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636201566},{"amount":41.13,"local_amount":41.13,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:22:15Z","rounded_local_amount":41.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650537297},{"amount":36.94,"local_amount":36.94,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":36.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666803175},{"amount":40.27,"local_amount":40.27,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":40.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683483243},{"amount":40.64,"local_amount":40.64,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":40.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696540808},{"amount":40.92,"local_amount":40.92,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":40.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711454286},{"amount":43.11,"local_amount":43.11,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":43.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730974861},{"amount":42.89,"local_amount":42.89,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:34:21Z","rounded_local_amount":42.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752063415}],"funded_date":"2015-02-18T00:21:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Reece","image":null}},{"id":840944,"name":"Christina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christina is a 29-year-old, married woman with 5 children. \r\n\r\nShe runs a small canteen in her community to earn a living, and she has 1 year of experience with this business.

She studied as far as her high school diploma and is in a happy relationship. Her partner works in a sugar plant, driving the lorries transporting the sugar cane. \r\n\r\nThey have two small children and only one of them is at school. From a very young age, Evelyn used to accompany her grandmother to the market, to the stall where she sold spices, and that is how she found out she liked the business. When she was 14 years old she went to the United States in order to improve her prospects and that is where she got her high school diploma.\r\n\r\nEvelyn returned to her home country when she was 19 years old and studied cosmetology. Later on when her first child was born she decided to open her own business selling spices, cosmetics and natural medicines, on the same stall which her grandmother used to have. Her grandmother is now too old to look after the stall.

micro-entrepreneur from the Dahod district of Gujarat, in western India. She lost her husband a few years ago and supports her family of four by selling artificial jewelry and accessories like bangles, elastic bands, necklaces, and earrings to local women. Her monthly income of INR 6,000 contributes over 60% of her family\u2019s income. The remaining amount is earned by her older children, and Radhaben saves most of it, setting aside INR 4,000 each month.\r\n\r\nShe has a young pre-school aged child, and she wants to ensure a complete education for the young one. Radhaben realizes she must earn and save more for this. So every step she has taken so far is to ensure the financial stability of her family. \r\n\r\nShe plans to grow her business and needs to buy more inventory so she can sell a better variety of products and serve more customers. The capital she needs to invest in this growth, however, is too small an amount for local banks to finance. She does not want to raise this microfinance from local private lenders, as their steep interest rates could push her into deep debt. \r\n\r\nSo Radhaben has rallied four more women entrepreneurs, who also seek economic stability for their families. Sumitraben sells fruits, Naynaben runs a scrap business, Tejalben runs a small petty shop, and Shardaben, like Radhaben, sells accessories. Together, they seek a loan of INR 58,000, which they will invest in buying more inventory for the growth of their small businesses. Your loan will provide these five mothers a much needed timely boost for their microenterprises. With this investment, Radhaben, for instance, will be able to net an extra INR 7,000 each month. She plans on re-investing most of this into her business and towards repaying this loan. The remaining INR 1,000, she will add to her monthly savings.\r\n\r\nRadhaben and her group are grateful for this opportunity and your support in building a better future for their families."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":712.5,"image":{"id":1810081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded

She would also like her butchering business to grow so that in the future she can butcher larger animals like cattle."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":369.61,"image":{"id":1817038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy pigs to butcher and sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-02-17T13:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-19T13:40:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Ride ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":34.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":37.26},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":37.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":39.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":43.07},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":44.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":45.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":47.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":49.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.07},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.57},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.24},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.18,"local_amount":36.18,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:08:38Z","rounded_local_amount":36.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833781},{"amount":38.98,"local_amount":38.98,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:03:39Z","rounded_local_amount":38.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636201569},{"amount":38.02,"local_amount":38.02,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":38.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650537300},{"amount":40.26,"local_amount":40.26,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":40.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666803178},{"amount":41.01,"local_amount":41.01,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":41.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683483247},{"amount":41.6,"local_amount":41.6,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":41.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696540812},{"amount":43.17,"local_amount":43.17,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":43.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711454290},{"amount":44.45,"local_amount":44.45,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":44.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730974865},{"amount":45.94,"local_amount":45.94,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:34:22Z","rounded_local_amount":45.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752063419}],"funded_date":"2015-02-17T16:05:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":835006,"name":"Thae Kone Gyi Village Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This community is located Thae Kone Gyi Village, Myanmar Ayeyarwaddy Delta region.

Meet Agus, a Ruma agent who lives in Depok. Depok is a city located at the south of Jakarta. Agus is happily married, and his wife is a full time housewife. Agus and his wife have been blessed with 3 children.  As a main source of income, Agus owns and manages a small stall that sells daily consumer products, snacks and drinks, mobile phone airtime credits, and provides utility bill payment services to his community. Agus joined Ruma about 4 months ago because he wanted to improve his business and he felt excited to learn more about mobile technology from Ruma mobile application. As the business runs, Agus is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to process more mobile airtime credits and utility bill payment transactions, especially on the weekends. In the near future, Agus also plans to improve his selling with a new product from Ruma, which is an e-commerce for remote communities called 'Mapan'. By serving Mapan to his customers, Agus will be able to receive orders from customers who want to buy products that have been listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer orders, Agus will simply send an SMS to an SMS center; the customer will pay him, and a Ruma agent will come to his stall to collect the money. Within 3-5 days, the product will be delivered right to the customer's door. With Mapan, Agus believes that his community will be able to have access to high quality products with better prices and, of course, his stall will improve. In the photo, Agus is sitting in his small stall. He thanks you for your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1804492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to provide more mobile services in his community","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Depok","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-02-17T14:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-19T14:20:05Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":12000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":12000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-17T20:17:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":836226,"name":"Nh\u00f3m 05- Th\u00f4n 3 - Th\u1ecd V\u1ef1c - Tri\u1ec7u S\u01a1n Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs V\u1ea1n has a stall selling meat.

These usages will boost their income from more duck eggs.\r\n\r\nBesides duck raising, many Hmaw Win Su Villagers are farmers who plant rice and seasonal fruits. As a second business, villagers sometimes go fishing and sell their catches to nearby villages. As a source of savings, some households also raise pigs.  \r\nPictured above are CBO members from Hmaw Win Su group named U Win, U Kyi, U Thant, U Myo and Daw Shwe. U Win (first from left) is 67 years old and married with one child, a primary student. In addition to their duck farm, U Win's family has a 2-acre crop farm where it growns bananas, coconuts and guavas. Like other fellow members, U Win family will use Proximity's loan to purchase high-quality feed and repair their duck farm. The high-quality feed will increase duck production and raise the selling price of full-grown ducks.  This will be a critical boost to U Win's family income to help support expenditures such as their child's education.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1810564,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones","Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To help the Hmaw Win Su Village purchase high-quality feed and repair duck farms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MM","country":"Myanmar (Burma)","town":"Pyapon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22 98","type":"point"}},"partner_id":416,"posted_date":"2015-02-17T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-19T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":3700,"lender_count":136,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hmaw Win Su Village Group","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MMK","disbursal_amount":3800000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-19T00:54:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":840957,"name":"Taunese","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Taunese is a 41-year-old woman with seven children.

This time she has requested a new loan to purchase two disc blades for her woodcutting machine, and new brushes for the application of glue, varnish, and resin.\r\n\r\n\"It's satisfying to see that we work as a great team, now that my son has joined us, helping us in the woodworking shop\", she says.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken in the woodworking shop where Do\u00f1a In\u00e9s enjoys working.

Viven en una comunidad muy tranquila donde se trabaja la tierra sembrando ma\u00edz, haba, frijol, calabaza y nopales. \n\nDon Samuel es un hombre extraordinario y muy trabajador, siempre al pendiente de su familia, tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casado con la se\u00f1ora Rosalba y tienen ocho hijos de los cuales ya solo cuatro dependen de ellos. \n\nAnteriormente, Samuel trabajaba en la Cuidad de M\u00e9xico como empleado en una herrer\u00eda donde aprendi\u00f3 todo lo que ahora pone en pr\u00e1ctica en su establecimiento. Mientras trabajaba y adquir\u00eda experiencia, ahorr\u00f3 parte de sus ganancias para iniciar su propio negocio. \"La necesidad y la falta de un empleo fijo fueron otros motivos por los cuales tambi\u00e9n inici\u00e9 mi actividad\". Samuel cuenta que cuando no hab\u00eda clientes en la herrer\u00eda tampoco hab\u00eda sueldo para \u00e9l. Adem\u00e1s estar alejado tanto tiempo de su familia tampoco era algo que pudiera tolerar por tanto tiempo. Ahora, a pesar de no haber recibido ninguna capacitaci\u00f3n formal, Samuel es uno de los mejores herreros de su comunidad. \n\nCuando inici\u00f3 no contaba con un espacio apto para realizar su trabajo, ocupaba una parte de su casa, pero actualmente tiene un local estable y propio. Cuando tiene mucha carga de trabajo, uno de sus hijos le ayuda para cumplir con sus encargos. Otra dificultad de la actividad de Samuel es la escasez de herramientas m\u00e1s sofisticadas para hacer m\u00e1s puertas y ventanas. \n\nEsta es la primera vez que Samuel solicita un cr\u00e9dito a VisionFund M\u00e9xico y lo ocupar\u00e1 para comprar material necesario para continuar su trabajo. \u201cNunca me ha gustado tener deudas pero creo que ayudara en la estabilidad de mi negocio, porque en estos momentos no cuento con dinero suficiente para comprar todo el material\u201d comento Don Samuel. Uno de sus sue\u00f1os es poder hacer crecer su negocio para mejorar su vivienda y seguir dando estudios a sus hijos.\n\nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Carmen, Marcelina, Rosa, Maria Felix y Heriberto ellos invertir\u00e1n es sus borregos y Roc\u00edo en zapatos.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el municipio, en las escaleras del quiosco.

They live in a very tranquil community where they work the land, sowing corn, fava beans, beans, pumpkins, and prickly pears.\r\n\r\nDon Samuel is an extraordinary and hardworking man, always looking out for his family. He is 45 years old, married to Se\u00f1ora Rosalba, and has eight children, only four of whom depend on them.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Samuel worked in a smithy in Mexico City, where he learned everything that he now puts to practice in his own establishment. While he worked and acquired experience, he saved part of his income to start his own business. \"The necessity and shortage of permanent employees were other motivations for why I started my business.\" Samuel says that while he had no clients in his smithy, he didn't have any salary for himself either. Additionally, being cut off from his family was not something he could tolerate for so much time. Today, despite not having received any sort of formal certification, Samuel is one of the best blacksmiths of his community.\r\n\r\nWhen he started, he couldn't count on an appropriate space to begin his business and he worked out of a part of his house. But currently he has his own stable property. When he has a lot of work, one of his children helps him to fulfill his orders. Another difficulty with Samuel's business is the shortage of more sophisticated tools to make more doors and windows.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Samuel is asking for a loan from VisionFund M\u00e9xico, and he will use it to buy the material he needs to continue his work. \"I have never liked having debts but I believe that it will help me to establish my business, because right now I don't have sufficient funds to buy all the material,\" Don Samuel comments. One of his dreams is to be able to grow his business to improve his life and to continue giving education to his children.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Carmen, Marcelina, Rosa, Maria Felix and Heriberto, who will invest in their sheep, and Roc\u00edo, who will invest in shoes. \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in the municipality, on the stairs of the kiosk.

Even though her home needs some additional work, a proper wall is essential to her because she stores all her inventory inside her house and does not feel safe with the wood fence she has right now. She says that after she addresses this task, she will continue with her house. Given Alicia's age, her low income and the fact that she cannot ask for a mortgage for her house, Alicia has no other institutions to turn to for credit.

He has been working as a construction worker in the town for the last 15 years. Jose Felipe strives to give his son the life he always dreamed of. He wants him to study and work hard to get to university so he can have more opportunities than he did. Jose Felipe works doing construction tasks for the people in town. He says his life is a paradox- the construction worker does not have a proper home. He is building this room for his son, so he can have his own space.

Mariana has been separated from her husband for a number of years.  She has four daughters.  Thanks to the efforts of her parents, she was able to finish elementary school, but later she left school because she had a new challenge in life: to care for her daughter.  This is why she started working from a young age to support herself.\r\n\r\nFor Mariana it was not easy to leave her parents because she was the darling of the household.  She suffered a lot, but nonetheless she fought to be a good mother and wife, and to give the best to her children, and she refused to be defeated by the pain that she felt.  Now she is very happy because God and life have given her the opportunity to see her daughters grow up.\r\n\r\nNow Mariana and her daughters live in their own home, and she has been working selling snacks, raising animals, and renting volleyball courts for a number of years.  In spite of her work that takes up a lot of her time and effort, she also spends a lot of time taking care of her daughters.\r\n\r\nMariana is a very hardworking and enterprising woman.  Today, she is requesting a loan to buy ceramics and fixed assets to improve her shop.  This will help her to improve her standard of living and that of her family, and will enable her to give her daughters the education they deserve.\r\n\r\nMariana is grateful to Fundacion Alternativa in Ecuador and to Kiva for making it possible for her to grow in her work and personal life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":929.84,"image":{"id":1813563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy ceramics and fixed assets to improve her shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2015-02-17T22:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-19T22:20:15Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariana De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1635.18,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":79.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":95.07},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":98.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":97.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":105.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":110.54},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":111.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":114.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":117.37},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":118.89},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":123.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125.44},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":128.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.93},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.43},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.36},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.58},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":84.32,"local_amount":83.56,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":84.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636217575},{"amount":198.63,"local_amount":196.85,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":198.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649568050},{"amount":100.69,"local_amount":99.79,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T12:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":100.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665436770},{"amount":107.72,"local_amount":106.75,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":107.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347834},{"amount":102.11,"local_amount":101.19,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":102.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696558229},{"amount":110.32,"local_amount":109.33,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":110.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711473169},{"amount":114.75,"local_amount":113.72,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":114.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730992207},{"amount":111.3,"local_amount":110.3,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":111.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752080506}],"funded_date":"2015-02-25T22:35:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":838536,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The borrower is married, lives with his family.

married, and the mother of three children who take an active part in the farm work.  Dilfuzahon has a secondary education and she has been involved in agriculture (crop farming and animal husbandry) since 1990.  By nature, she is very hardworking and caring.  She currently has two cows and one sheep on her farm.  She also grows potatoes, tomatoes and garlic on 0.45 hectare of her own land.  The family's total income comes to about 18,000 som (KGS) per month.  Dilfuzahon has decided to expand her activity, and for this reason she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 75,000 som (KGS) to buy calves and mineral fertilizers to prepare her land.  Dilfuzahon is a member of the \"Otabek\" group which comprises two other members.  She is planning to use the profits she'll make from her loan to renovate her

Now it\u2019s time for you to meet one of Ruma\u2019s agents, Yasri.\r\n \r\nYasri lives in South Tangerang, located about an hour's drive from Jakarta, the capital city. He lives there with his wife and 4 children (two daughters and two sons). He owns a stall where every day he sells consumer products, small snacks and drinks, and provides mobile payment services for his community. \r\n\r\nYasri joined Ruma in 2014 and this is the second time he has applied for a loan through Kiva. His community have always seen him as a trusted mobile service provider, and he has a friendly and responsible personality. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Yasri is becoming the agent of Ruma\u2019s product called Mapan. Mapan is an e-commerce facility for lower communities. By offering Mapan to his customers, Yasri will be able to receive orders from customers who want to buy products that have been listed in Ruma's Mapan catalogue. When a customer orders, Yasri will simply send an SMS in a special format to the SMS center, and then the customer will pay to him. After this, Ruma\u2019s agent will come to him to collect the money and within 3-5 days, the product will be delivered right to the customer's door. \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Yasri is hoping to get another working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile payment services to his community. \r\n\r\nYour loan will be very useful and important to Yasri, as it will help him to improve his business and subsequently his community, who need access to such services.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Yasri is standing in his own small stall. He will be very thankful for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1816334,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To provide more mobile payment services for his community","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Tangerang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.178056 106.63","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-02-18T07:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:07Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yasri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":10000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":10000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-20T02:29:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sally Otway","image":1443524}},{"id":841153,"name":"Rosalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalie works hard to support her family.
