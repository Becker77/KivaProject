For this reason, Mohammed applied for a loan of 100,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase some of the necessary spare parts to repair his bus.\r\n\r\nMohammed hopes to get married soon.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":316.81,"image":{"id":1816361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Arab Youth","Youth","Islamic Finance"],"use":"To purchase some of the necessary spare parts to repair his bus.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Sana'a","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2015-02-18T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-20T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohammed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":8414},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2015-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":8326}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.96,"local_amount":8414,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":8596.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636140412},{"amount":39.55,"local_amount":8326,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":8506.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650499709},{"amount":39.55,"local_amount":8326,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-25T12:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":8506.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665378591},{"amount":39.55,"local_amount":8326,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-29T12:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":8506.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681273426},{"amount":79.1,"local_amount":16652,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-23T12:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":17012.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711392614},{"amount":39.55,"local_amount":8326,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-28T12:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":8506.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730915432},{"amount":39.55,"local_amount":8326,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-01T13:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":8506.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752006579}],"funded_date":"2015-02-18T15:40:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":841167,"name":"Put's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Put\u2019s group live in a rural village near Phnom Penh city in Cambodia.

She is 51 and married and lives in the Sarband region with her family. She has three growing children whose needs are growing, too. It was getting hard for her husband to provide for the children on his own, so Gul started to work as well. For the past two years she has been selling bread products at the local market, an occupation she enjoys. She goes to work in all weather and in the future hopes to have her own space or booth.\r\n\r\nThe reason Gul is looking for a loan is to purchase building materials to renovate her house. She doesn't have the money to finish the renovations. She hopes that she will receive this loan so she will be able to complete her renovations."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":458.94,"image":{"id":1813958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Sarband","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-02-18T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-20T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":29.67,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gul ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":276.35},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":261.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":297.14},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":295.51},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":304.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":328.27},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":335.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":349.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":366.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":381.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":396.6},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":407.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.82},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.71},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.41},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51.05,"local_amount":276.35,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":279.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.77,"payment_id":636348978},{"amount":46.23,"local_amount":261.32,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":264.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.77,"payment_id":649621509},{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":297.14,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":300.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.93,"payment_id":665101482},{"amount":52.49,"local_amount":295.51,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:26:48Z","rounded_local_amount":298.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.92,"payment_id":681399592},{"amount":53.87,"local_amount":304.2,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:25:30Z","rounded_local_amount":307.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.17,"payment_id":696609664},{"amount":57.3,"local_amount":328.27,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":331.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.25,"payment_id":711525691},{"amount":56.96,"local_amount":335.23,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:06:58Z","rounded_local_amount":338.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.9,"payment_id":731041457},{"amount":58.59,"local_amount":349.59,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":353.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.96,"payment_id":752130428}],"funded_date":"2015-03-19T13:57:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":838394,"name":"Mpunga Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zuhura is in her early 40s, married, and has one child.

Zuhura will use this loan to purchase charcoal to sell as well as more ingredients to make her samosas. Zuhara dreams of improving her business and building her own home.

Sally is a smallholder mixed farmer based in Nandi Hills, a remote village in Kenya. She is the mother of five lovely children and has been practicing mixed farming for the last two years.\n\nTo earn a decent living, she sells eggs, milk,tea and greens and engages in numerous small personal businesses, including transportation. Only recently, she started seeing how she could make more money through poultry farming. In the past, she saw raising hens as just a hobby. She wants to sell more eggs but realizes that the quantity she produces now will not make economic sense. She needs to purchase more poultry.\n\nHowever, her biggest challenge today is limited funds to expand her business. Sally is seeking a loan of KES 20,000 from Kiva lenders, via Juhudi Kilimo, to purchase poultry. Future proceeds from the commercialization of her poultry farm are already committed to paying for her children's education.

Meet Florence, a 58-year-old, very hardworking, honest, and ever smiling mother of seven children. She lives with her husband in the lush Chuka Hills, in the central region of Kenya. \r\n\r\nFlorence passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past thirty years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding the large family she has, requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are milk, crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her large family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. \r\n\r\nFlorence has identified a free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices in the recent past have been going up, so Florence, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learns that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nFlorence said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural-based loans, and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis.

Meet Roline from Chuka Kenya, a woman from a community not known for farming but who is earning a living through agriculture. She is happily married and together with her husband is blessed with three lovely children. For the past 20 years, she has been practicing mixed farming, and, because of the experience she has, she commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers and she is regarded as a mentor. Income from milk, eggs, and maize selling have allowed her to earn a decent income. To make the extra coin, Roline engages in small personal business. Roline passionately loves dairy farming and the animal on her farm has been given the name of \u201cKairo.\u201d Milking and feeding Kairo (the name of her cow) makes her very proud. <br \/><br \/>Through milk selling, she has had quite good returns and the demand for milk has been expanding. Through extensive use of her mobile phone, she has been receiving orders from customers. Then she can SMS her customers when milk is ready for collection, and because of using ICT she has had a comparative edge in her dairy business. <br \/><br \/>Demand has been overwhelming and she needs an extra breed of cow to satisfy fully the demand. She is requesting a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Roline does not intend to buy just an ordinary cow but she wants to buy a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce rich creamy milk. The dairy cow will be producing between 15-20 litres of milk a day. The increased milk production will translate to more income and Roline will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her school going children. When anybody listens to Roline speak, one would be forgiven for thinking that she is an expert in dairy farming but because of passion and determination she intends to beat all odds.

","en":"Mavluda is a 49-year-old woman who is married and has three children. She lives in a rural area and sews traditional dresses. She started sewing as a child because her mother was a seamstress and taught her to love sewing. Her husband and youngest son are construction workers in Russia and send her money every month, which she uses to renovate and repair the house. Right now business is good for Mavluda, but her husband and son cannot send any money home because of the political situation in Russia. She has had to rely on her own income to finish the repairs on the house. She does not earn enough money, so she decided to apply for financial support with MDO Arvand. She wants to use the loan she receives to finish the repairs. Mavluda is grateful for loans made to low-income rural residents."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":595.73,"image":{"id":1813465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"renovate her home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

This group consists of three women, who have worked for eight years as an organized group in Fray Casiano\u2014a high-poverty area in Puntarenas, in the Central Pacific region of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nThe members have shown a good understanding of group work concepts, solidarity, and saving; moreover, they coordinate activities to earn money, and they have clear work rules. They have requested loans and understand the group work modality. The board of directors was formed, and the document number 4 for this loan application was drafted. \r\n\r\nTheir hard work and efforts have allowed them to better consolidate their street trading businesses, a fact that has been corroborated during a visit with each one of the members.\r\n\r\nYesenia is a member of the group and will invest her loan in the purchase of sandals, clothes, beauty products, and general merchandise in order to increase her inventory and fulfill orders in the area of Puntarenas during the summer season, which is one of the best seasons for trade and, thus, a great opportunity for sales.\r\n\r\nYesenia is a very hard-working woman, and thanks to the group's internal organization, she manages to make the weekly repayments, which allows them more leeway to obtain the money to repay the loan. She is the chair of the group and is regarded as a good leader. She hopes to be granted this loan to keep on growing each day.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the members sell food and organize raffles\u2014activities that allow them to increase their savings and help their families with the household expenses and their children's education. Since the majority of the members are single mothers and heads of their households, their income is very important for the quality of life and that of their children. \r\n\r\nThey are hard-working women, who have managed to succeed and improve their families' income through the organization. By supporting their children's education and helping out their partners with the household expenses, these women have managed to make their presence felt in the area where they live.\r\n\r\nThey are known for selling food in the community on weekends. They employ other people (mainly relatives) to prepare the food\u2014traditional dishes of the Costa Rican coastal zone such as \"vigor\u00f3n\" (boiled cassava mixed with pork rinds and covered with a spicy cabbage salad), \"frito\" (pig soup), ceviche (marinated raw fish or seafood), and tamales.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1714.07,"image":{"id":1817067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy clothes and merchandise to sell in the summer season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Puntarenas, Fray Casiano","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2015-02-18T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-20T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yesenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dayana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gerardina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":107351.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":108962.27},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":110596.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":112255.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":113939.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":115648.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":117383.31},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":119144.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":120931.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":122745.19},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":124586.37},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":126455.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.91},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.34},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":235.83},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":203.36,"local_amount":107433.01,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-19T11:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":108042.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636841381},{"amount":415.6,"local_amount":219561.43,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:56:39Z","rounded_local_amount":220807.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681351449},{"amount":212.64,"local_amount":112337.94,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:59:05Z","rounded_local_amount":112975.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696781539},{"amount":215.83,"local_amount":114023.01,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-24T12:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":114670.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":713908370},{"amount":218.91,"local_amount":115652.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-19T12:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":116308.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731625098},{"amount":447.73,"local_amount":236535.02,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-24T13:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":237877.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752084038}],"funded_date":"2015-03-07T23:33:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Flores","image":null}},{"id":841370,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary has sold fruit drinks, milk, toothpaste, corn beef, banku and stew for 11 years now, in a kiosk at her residence.

village in the Litein area of Kenya. Today, this humble mother sells milk, eggs, tea, and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has of farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow, and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit, and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. With the loan, she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding it. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax, and it can also protect them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Emily believes that with this loan her living conditions will change, because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

They organized themselves a year ago in order to access credit via the group methodology so that they could grow in their small businesses. They launched their businesses with their own efforts in order to generate income and cover the necessities of education, clothing, and food for their children. \r\n\r\nThey are requesting their second loan with Kiva. With the first loan, Jacqueline, the coordinator of the communal bank, was able to buy bales of used clothing in Managua and sell them on the streets; group member Alba was able to stock her business with household goods.\r\n\r\nYahosca Mercedes is a new member of the communal bank. She is a jovial young 22-year-old woman with a desire to better herself. She is a native of Bilwi and is married with three children. The oldest, who is 6 years old, is studying in the first grade of primary school; the other two are younger. Her husband works informally, selling wood. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of having her own source of income, Yahosca established her small neighborhood store two years ago on the porch of her wooden stilt house. She still remembers with great joy how, with her family's efforts, she managed to launch her small business, starting with $12,000 C\u00f3rdobas Netos [NIO]. She is requesting her first loan in order to diversify her products and to buy chicken, canned goods, and other household products.

children.  He completed 9 years of secondary school before enrolling in a technical college where he was trained as a metal worker.  He then started working as a locksmith in his own village.  With the money saved from this job, he decided to start his own business and got involved in animal husbandry.  His herd currently comprises 10 sheep which he fattens and resells, before buying new sheep at a lower price.  Dilshod has a large family and he works really hard to support them.  He wants to increase his livestock headcount, but at the moment he doesn't have enough money to do so.  For this reason, he has turned to MDO Arvand and asked for financial support.  He thanks you in advance for your

He is the father of six children and the grandfather of 20 grandchildren.  He was born in the countryside and got involved in animal husbandry right after finishing school.  He had dreamed of attending college but his parents didn't have enough money, so for this reason, Abdumajid never received a higher education.  He got married when he was 20.  After his children were born, he had to find work in construction in order to feed his family.  He currently owns a small plot of land on which he raises livestock.  He fattens his animals and then resells them at the market.  Abdumajid would like to increase his livestock headcount, but he doesn't have the financial means to do so.  For this reason, he has turned to MDO Arvand for financial assistance.  He thanks you in advance for your trust and

Meet Hellen, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Nkubu area of Kenya. Hellen, 59 , has been farming for the past 20 years. Through these years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Hellen is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. \r\n\r\nAlthough she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Nkubu area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Hellen could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Hellen, but she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Hellen believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable a permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Hellen to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":182.08,"image":{"id":1816766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-19T02:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-21T02:40:04Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.95,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1769.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1821.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1874.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1929},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1985.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2043.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2103.15},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2164.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2227.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2292.98},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2359.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2428.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.62},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.13},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":4292.31,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4317.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265170},{"amount":43.38,"local_amount":3943.83,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3966.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459826},{"amount":43.7,"local_amount":4040.54,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4064.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.75,"payment_id":696587907},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":4275.49,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4300.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.2,"payment_id":731023028}],"funded_date":"2015-02-19T04:19:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":841461,"name":"Giberta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Giberta is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a food vending business in the Philippines.

lives in the village of Londiani in the Litein area of Kenya. For the past year, Emily has been actively involved in mixed farming. Because she is from rural Kenya, gender roles still adhere and women do the heavy work of fetching and carrying water and wood, in addition to household chores, childcare and tending crops. This has not been a setback because Emily has been making great profits with dairy and crop farming. \r\n\r\nKericho is one of the places with conditions that favor horticulture farming: good climate, soils, transport system, and a market. Emily has always wanted to diversify and start horticultural farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is lack of funds. She is therefore requesting a loan to start horticultural farming. \r\n\r\nWith Tulwap Tolletge self-help group, whose members co-guarantee each other to secure a loan, Emily joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance organization that supports young and enterprising farmers. With your loan Emily intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers and potatoes. Proximity to an airstrip will allow her to transport the produce faster to an international market, hence enabling her to make more money. This loan will improve Emily's living conditions and secure the future of her children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":189.86,"image":{"id":1816808,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-19T03:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-21T03:40:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.55,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.56,"local_amount":2190.87,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2337.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601303},{"amount":50.03,"local_amount":4332.35,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4621.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.51,"payment_id":681378203},{"amount":27.33,"local_amount":2382.5,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2541.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.47,"payment_id":696587908},{"amount":27.24,"local_amount":2445.17,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2608.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.29,"payment_id":711506184},{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":2382.31,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2541.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.71,"payment_id":731023029},{"amount":29.07,"local_amount":2540.45,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2710.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.57,"payment_id":752111176}],"funded_date":"2015-02-19T11:01:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":841499,"name":"Crusade Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The group Crusade is composed of five women, who average 45 years of age and three children each.

So the family lives in poverty and requires additional income to cover all daily expenses. \r\n\r\nInga requested a loan from local financial institutions and was rejected several times, as the creditors didn't find enough family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. The start-up program that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enabled rural poor like Inga to get the chance to start or re-start businesses. \r\n\r\nSo Inga has been approved for the loan of 6,000 GEL for opening a market. She will purchase a stock of food products and all the needed materials to open a market. Inga will work as a sales lady there and she will do her best to run the market. Inga will be able to get a profit that will be significant for her poor family.

This has had considerable cost implications and has greatly impacted their revenue. \r\n\r\nGladness already took initiative and dug a well, and now only needs the windmill to pump water from the well. She decided to use a windmill to take advantage of wind as a natural, renewable resource that does not have the negative impacts on the environment compared to generators or other mechanical pumps.\r\n\r\nShe believes that by securing a stable water source, the farm will cut down on costs while simultaneously improving on productivity.

He lives in the village Kakhati with his wife, parents and children. Zviad helps the family with its agricultural business. \r\n\r\nHe requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for his trading business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because the creditors did not find the existing family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is a small-scale family agricultural business. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nZviad requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program envisages provisions for business startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who, regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Zviad will start trading in seasonal fruits and vegetables. He will purchase fruits and vegetables from local farmers at wholesale prices and sell them in nearby towns with a price markup. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva startup loan, will significantly increase the family's income. Their income will double, and the family members will be able to improve their living

After finishing nine years of school, Abdugafur left to work in a factory.  He had to work because he wanted to help his parents.  At the age of 18, Abdugafur married and decided to continue his family business, so he started raising livestock.  On his plot of land, he looks after six sheep and three cows.  His eldest son and youngest daughter help him in his business.  Despite his age, Abdugafur is a cheerful and healthy man who is capable of working and feeding his family.

Ellas se conocen desde ni\u00f1as y el lazo de amistad que las une es una caracter\u00edstica que tambi\u00e9n las distingue. \n\nEl nombre del grupo lo eligieron porque la mayor\u00eda se dedica a trabajar el campo cultivando ma\u00edz, frijoles, habas y calabazas, los cuales sirven como alimento para su familia durante todo el a\u00f1o. Adem\u00e1s, tambi\u00e9n venden parte de lo que producen y esto les permite a todas ellas ayudar a sus esposos quienes trabajan como obreros. \n\nDo\u00f1a Gregoria es una mujer orgullosa de sus ra\u00edces, platicadora, sonriente y muy trabajadora, ha vivido a lado de Don Gerardo durante 43 a\u00f1os, juntos formaron una familia de 12 hijos de los cuales cuatro aun dependen de ellos aunque s\u00f3lo una decidi\u00f3 seguir estudiando.\n\nA sus 60 a\u00f1os, Gregoria a\u00fan se dedica a criar animales como borregos, pollos y pavos. Todos los d\u00edas, Do\u00f1a Gregoria se queda en casa a atender a sus animales mientras Don Gerardo se gana el sustento para su hogar trabajando como chofer de maquinaria pesada. \u201cCrec\u00ed en el campo, desde peque\u00f1a aprend\u00ed a cuidar a los animales porque mis padres tambi\u00e9n se dedicaban a eso. Ahora que tengo una familia es una manera de apoyar econ\u00f3micamente a mi esposo\u201d. Ya son 43 a\u00f1os de experiencia en su trabajo y muchas veces los clientes llegan a su casa para comprar los animales que por lo regular conserva s\u00f3lo un a\u00f1o.\n\nEsta vez, Gregoria necesita un pr\u00e9stamo para reiniciar con la cr\u00eda de sus borregos porque es el \u00fanico tipo de animal que ya no tiene en casa. Ella est\u00e1 muy agradecida con Kiva y VisionFund porque sus ganancias le han permitido tener m\u00e1s animales y construir hasta 40 corrales. Sin embargo, lo m\u00e1s importante es que logr\u00f3 ofrecer a sus hijos educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica \u201cMis hijos eran muy peque\u00f1os, todos estudiaban y los gastos eran demasiado, pero con el pr\u00e9stamo pod\u00edamos sacar un poco m\u00e1s de dinero\". \n\nActualmente s\u00f3lo una de sus hijas est\u00e1 estudiando, quiere ser maestra de danza en la escuela de Bellas Artes, es el orgullo de Do\u00f1a Gregoria y Don Gerardo.

They have known each other since childhood and the bond of friendship that unites them is one characteristic that also sets them apart.\r\n\r\nThey chose the group's name because the majority of them work in the countryside growing corn, beans, broad beans, and squash, which serve them as food for their family throughout the year. In addition, they also sell part of what they produce and this allows them all to help their spouses who work as laborers. \r\n\r\nGregoria is a woman proud of her roots, chatty, smiling, and very hard-working. She has lived at the side of Gerardo for 43 years, and together they made a family with 12 children of whom four still depend on them although only one is still a student. \r\n\r\nAt 60 years old, Gregoria still works raising animals such as sheep, chickens, and turkeys. Every day, Gregoria stays home to take care of her animals while Gerardo earns the household sustenance working as a heavy machinery operator. \"I grew up in the countryside, and since I was young, I learned to care for the animals because my parents also worked in this. Now that I have a family, it is a way to economically support my husband.\" She has 43 years of experience in her work and many times customers come to her house to purchase the animals that typically she keeps for only one year. \r\n\r\nThis time, Gregoria needs a loan to begin again with raising her sheep because it is the only type of animal she doesn't have in the house now. She is very grateful to Kiva and VisionFund because her earnings have permitted her to have more animals and build up to 40 stalls. However, the most important is that she managed to offer her children a basic education. \"My children were very small, all of them went to school and the expenses were too much, but with the loan, we could get a little more money.\"\r\n\r\nCurrently, only one of her daughters is a student, she wants to be a dance instructor at the fine arts school, and is the pride of Gregoria and Gerardo. Although the school costs are very high, her parents work hard to be able to pay the tuition among other expenses. Gregoria wants to see her daughter become a professional but she would also love her children who are not students to also be motivated and go back to school to have a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nThe other members will also invest in raising animals: Francisca, Leticia and Maria, in sheep; Paula in embroidery; Epifania, in chickens and turkeys, while Ma Guadalupe will use her loan to purchase lambs, chickens and turkeys.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4100,"image":{"id":1811886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

He grew up alone with his parents. He has been in a relationship for 17 years and got married 5 years ago.

Congo. For over 20 years Jean has been running his own small businesses in Brazzaville. Currently, Jean sells pharmaceutical products at his table in the market. He also sells various items such jewelry and other personal accessories. In 2012, Jean joined the community bank group L\u2019ACCOMPLISSEMENT and leads the group of 8 micro-entrepreneurs. Now about to start his 7th loan cycle with HOPE Congo, Jean would like to take out a loan of 900,000 CFA.\n\nThis loan will allow Jean to move from just a table in the market, to opening up his own shop. He will use the money to start renting the shop space and filling it out with merchandise.

At just 25 years of age, Djokel is already two years into running his own business selling phone SIM cards and phone credit in the markets of Brazzaville. \r\n\r\nIn order to help expand his business, Djokel joined the community bank group LES AMIS DE CHRIST (1) at HOPE Congo and helps lead a subgroup of 10 other micro-entrepreneurs. Now on his second loan cycle with HOPE Congo, Djokel would like to take out a loan of 300,000 CFA. \r\n\r\nWith this money, Djokel will be able to replenish his stock of SIM and phone credit cards, and also being to launch his second activity. Djokel has the dream of having his own barber shop, and hopes that through a series of loans, starting with this one, he will be able to achieve his dream.

Now it\u2019s time for you to meet Toris, one of Ruma\u2019s agents. Toris lives in North Bogor, located about one hour and thirty minutes' drive from Jakarta, the capital city. She lives there with her husband and her two children (one daughter and one son). \r\n\r\nToris owns a stall where she sells daily consumer products and small snacks, and provides mobile payment services for her community. She joined Ruma in 2014. She wanted to join Ruma because, as a woman, she wants to help her husband in improving their lives and learn about how to manage another business opportunity, as well as give more contribution to her community. \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Toris is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to provide more mobile payment services to her community, especially on weekends. Having known about the importance, your loan will be very useful to help Toris improve her business, and accordingly, her community that needs access to such services. \r\n\r\nAs seen in the photo, Toris is the one who is standing in her own small stall. She will be thankful for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1817096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile

He lives with his wife, three children, and elderly parents. He has to work very hard to support such a large family. After all, he is the head of the family and cares for his parents, who are retired. Shavkat earns additional income raising cattle with help from his wife and children. In order to increase his income, Shavkat needs to be familiar with new technology. He also wants to learn to build houses, which means he needs to learn design skills. This will increase demand for his services. In the meantime he wants to take out a loan to update the tools he uses for repairs and buy new ones. He hopes MDO Arvand will help him with this. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1814328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy tools for home repairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-02-19T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-21T15:00:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.22,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shavkat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":73.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":73.86},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":76.36},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":78.15},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":81.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":87.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":92.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":96.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":100.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.32},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.03},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":13.37,"local_amount":66.84,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":72.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624277627},{"amount":14.44,"local_amount":73.47,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":79.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.25,"payment_id":636635065},{"amount":13.94,"local_amount":73.86,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:02:13Z","rounded_local_amount":79.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.83,"payment_id":649616401},{"amount":14.47,"local_amount":76.36,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:22:09Z","rounded_local_amount":82.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.8,"payment_id":666524426},{"amount":14.81,"local_amount":78.15,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:17:46Z","rounded_local_amount":84.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.82,"payment_id":681394702},{"amount":15.41,"local_amount":81.6,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-22T12:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":87.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.91,"payment_id":696605008},{"amount":102.34,"local_amount":549.72,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":592.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.61,"payment_id":711524516}],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T01:41:03Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T16:25:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Hendrickson","image":null}},{"id":841711,"name":"Romli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Good day, lenders!
