In addition, the biogas will be directly connected to the cookstove and the boiler, allowing Fernando to displace the expensive LP gas. \r\n\r\nFernando has been looking for waste treatment solutions for a long time, as hogs' manure is extremely contaminating, polluting underground water sources and emitting greenhouse gases.

In addition, there are things that inhibit the growth of pigs so that the pig\u2019s growth is not good. Even so, they do not give up in trying to overcome the problems they have in their own way so that their businesses can continue to operate smoothly.

However, they are very grateful still to be trusted to get a new loan. This loan was used to develop the business, particularly in raising pigs. Ni Nengah used the loan to buy superior quality piglets. She wants to expand her business. With the assistance of her husband, Ni Nengah is very excited to do her job.

With the instructions from their vet, the group keeps the pigs by giving them nutritious feed and vitamins.<br \/><br \/>Ni Made sold her piglets and earned a net profit of 2,000,000 IDR. It\u2019s all after deducting the cost of feed and making her payment. She\u2019s really happy for that and decided to continue her loan to increase her population of pigs. All the profit is used for her family\u2019s daily needs, repairing her house, and school fees.<br \/><br \/>After calculating and evaluating the last period, the Sari Rahayu Group decided to continue their loan. The loan will be used for increasing their pig businesses by purchasing new piglets or quality feed.

She lives in the Vose district with her large family, consisting of her husband, three sons, and two daughters. Her sons are ages 12, 18, and 20, and her daughters are 15 and 17. Her husband and eldest son work in Russia and her youngest son is a businessman. Her daughters both go to school. Her daughter-in-law is a homemaker and manages the household.

She has a specialized secondary education and, to provide additional income for her family, has been involved in animal husbandry and farming since 1996. Thanks to tireless work and help and support from her husband and children, Nasiypa achieved good business results. Today Nasiypa has a good farm, containing a cow, 2 calves and a horse. She also grows beans on 1.80 hectares of land. In order to further increase her livestock headcount, Nasiypa requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy 20 sheep.

married, and has five children. She has a secondary vocational education and is retired, though she continues to teach at the school. Her colleagues and neighbors speak highly of her and describe her as a quiet and hardworking woman. Toton earns additional income for her family by raising livestock and planting crops, which she has done since 1995 when she started a business with 60,000 som (KGS).

It is located in the Altiplano (the Bolician Plateau), and it has a cold and dry climate for most of the year, with a rainy season between December and February. \r\n\r\nIvis has brown skin, long black hair that she wears tied up, and short stature. Her mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1, and she speaks Spanish for general life and for her work. She shares her life with her partners, who works in business, and with her children who study in school. They live in a rented house, which is built from bricks with a corrugated iron roof; the house has drinking water, electricity, and indoor plumbing.\r\n\r\nHer business is making quilts and bedspreads for the bedroom. Her secondary activity is making musical instruments. Recently, she acquired a transportation vehicle for 16 passengers, which she plans to use for inter-departmental public transportation. She says that the need to have another source of income drove her to buy this vehicle; this will help her family in paying the expenses and will improve their quality of life. \r\n\r\nHer dream is building her own house. She wants to buy a roof rack for the roof of her car to accommodate her passengers\u2019 luggage. This is her second sequence of loans with the institution in her 16 years of pursuing different works. \r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Ivis requests a loan to buy a roof rack for the roof of her vehicle to transport the luggage of her future passengers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1818764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy a roof rack for the roof of her vehicle to transport the luggage of her future passengers.

He is considered a pacesetter when it comes to farming in his village of Chebiemit in the Kapsowar area of Kenya. Having done mixed farming for the past five years, he has gained much experience and he offers free extension services to young upcoming farmers. He is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. \r\n\r\nKiprono enjoys generating income from selling milk, his harvest, and produce from his farm. He finds dairy farming very fulfilling but the main challenge he faces is not being able to properly feed his dairy cows. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter. Through the loan he will be able to cut hay into small pieces before mixing it with other forage to feed his cattle. The chaff cutter will aid his cattle in digestion and will prevent his dairy cattle from rejecting any part of their food. Proper feeding of cattle is one of the most important factors in maintaining high yield production of milk. Through proper feeding, his cow will produce more milk and this will translate to more profits and improved living standards. \r\n\r\nWhen he was asked how this loan will benefit his family, Kiprono said \u201cmore income.\u201d Profits from the loan will be used in fully repaying the loan and improving standards of living for his parents, family, and his school-going children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":304.66,"image":{"id":1817419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a chaff cutter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-20T03:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-22T03:00:06Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.92,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kiprono","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.85,"local_amount":3804.14,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3826.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601305},{"amount":41.36,"local_amount":3759.93,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3781.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459828},{"amount":41.39,"local_amount":3801.14,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3823.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.42,"payment_id":681378206},{"amount":42.81,"local_amount":3957.99,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3981.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.73,"payment_id":696587911},{"amount":41.91,"local_amount":3992.1,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4015.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2,"payment_id":711506187},{"amount":90.42,"local_amount":8381.2,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":8430.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.77,"payment_id":752111179}],"funded_date":"2015-03-21T12:06:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":843050,"name":"Mirna De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mirna de 39 a\u00f1os de edad es madre soltera vive en casa propia con su hija y su nieta, ella se dedica a la venta de ropa interior para damas y caballeros,  desde hace 6 a\u00f1os ejerce este oficio y cuenta con muchos clientes fijos con lo que puede mantener su negocio a flote, con las ganancias que obtiene de sus ventas logar cubrir algunos gastos de su hogar, esta solicita un cr\u00e9dito para comprar mayor cantidad de ropa interior diferentes precios, estilos y colores y de esta forma contar con m\u00e1s clientes y as\u00ed mejorar su calidad de vida\n","en":"Mirna is a 39-year-old single mother who lives in her own home with her daughter and her granddaughter.

education \u2013 these are just some of the things going around Wilson\u2019s mind. \r\n\r\nWilson is a 46-year-old, smallholder farmer based in Litein, which is a small agricultural center near the famous Rift valley. He owns a small piece of land together with his lovely wife, and they have been blessed with a lovely family. \r\n\r\nOn the land, they have kept dairy cattle and grown vegetables for 10 years. Their main income sources are milk and crops. They recently ventured into a small personal business, or side hustle, as they like to put it. \r\n\r\nFrom Kiva lenders, Wilson is seeking a loan worth KES 65,000 to grow his horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. \r\n\r\nIt is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to afford Wilson access to a loan that will aid him to grow his horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Wilson\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":397.02,"image":{"id":1817477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to expand his horticulture farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-20T05:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-22T05:40:07Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.47,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":103.25,"local_amount":9256.71,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":9440.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459829},{"amount":51.39,"local_amount":4653.69,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4746.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.52,"payment_id":681378207},{"amount":65.85,"local_amount":6004.6,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":6124.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.12,"payment_id":696587912},{"amount":72.32,"local_amount":6654.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6786.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.9,"payment_id":731023032},{"amount":98.74,"local_amount":9025.61,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":9205.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.93,"payment_id":752111180}],"funded_date":"2015-03-21T16:32:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":842038,"name":"Eter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eter is 58 years old and a widowed woman from Sagarejo district.

He is arguably among the most successful farmers in the area. He rears cows on a small scale. \r\n\r\nBack in 2000, Elly began practicing traditional farming with little knowledge and no financing at all. He was growing only half an acre of maize per season. The returns were so meager that he could barely fend for himself. So when the family enlarged, he resorted to cattle farming, stating with a few cows which have later increased to give him profit.

She is married to Prospero, her business partner, and has four children with their own families.  She manages their household while operating a business. They work hard to provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nElsa owns and oversees operation of her jeepney service. She has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney. Jeepneys are the most common form of public transport throughout the many islands of the Philippines. Most of the time, the jeepneys are constantly packed with passengers. Jeepneys offer one of the cheapest ways of getting somewhere. They are one of the remnants of the American military presence in the Philippines during the Second World War and are still seen throughout the Philippines, in many colors and all over the place. Originally, jeepneys were old American jeeps. They were used in the war against the Japanese army who occupied the Philippines for several years. After the Japanese army was defeated and the American military mission was completed, the jeeps were left by the tens of thousands on the islands in the Philippines.The Filipinos saw possibilities to make out of these jeeps. They saw a real transportation means by making these jeeps about two meters longer and by putting two long seats in them, one on each side from the front to the back. Since then, jeepneys have been used as small buses for cheap transport of people, goods, and even sometimes little animals. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Elsa is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan, which she will use for repairs and maintenance of her jeepney. It is very important that her unit is always in good running condition to ensure efficient service. Her husband drives her jeepney so she is assured that her jeepney is well taken care of. Her earnings from their service helps fund their everyday needs. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nElsa hopes that their transport service will continue to be successful to be able to save for their old age. She prays for the safety of her husband and their passengers. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay Microfinance

She works with her husband, and their children when they are not in school.\r\n\r\nRosa needs this loan in order to buy two hundredweights of fish feed, and six bags of cement to construct another pool so as to have more fish. This loan will help Rosa to buy the necessary supplies to give her animals adequate feed so that they gain weight. She can then sell them and pay household costs.\r\n\r\nRosa\u2019s dreams are to increase fish production and to support her children with their education so that one day they may have a profession."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":226.95,"image":{"id":1818896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy two hundredweights of fish feed, and six bags of cement to construct another pool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-02-20T08:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-22T08:20:09Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Haydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":22.26},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":23.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":23.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":24.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":24.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":24.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":26.16},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":26.62},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":27.18},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":28.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.26},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.64},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.18},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.87,"local_amount":47.87,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":47.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636201595},{"amount":24.5,"local_amount":24.5,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":24.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650537324},{"amount":24.67,"local_amount":24.67,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":24.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666803204},{"amount":24.94,"local_amount":24.94,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":24.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683483274},{"amount":25.32,"local_amount":25.32,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":25.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696540835},{"amount":27.62,"local_amount":27.62,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:53:37Z","rounded_local_amount":27.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711454316},{"amount":25.29,"local_amount":25.29,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":25.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730974889},{"amount":26.74,"local_amount":26.74,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":26.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752063440}],"funded_date":"2015-02-20T13:06:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":843072,"name":"Walter Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Walter, de 40 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta noveno grado, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ado y tiene 2 hijos, su pareja se dedica a prestar servicios dom\u00e9sticos en casas particulares y viven con los padres de su pareja.\n\nWalter, decidi\u00f3 dedicarse al trabajo de mec\u00e1nica automotriz por la necesidad y pocas opciones de empleo en la localidad;

Meet Ephantus, a 45-year-old jovial father of lovely children whom he refers to as his \u201cheartbeat.\u201d\r\n\r\nEphantus hails from the Kerugoya area of Kenya, a place that has produced some top elite athletes for the world.  Kerugoya has good weather patterns that favor crop and dairy farming. \r\n\r\nEphantus is a very hardworking man who enjoys farming, which he has been doing on his small piece of land for the past 13 years. Through all those years, he has gained much experience and is one of the most respected farmers in his village. Because of the immense knowledge that he has of farming, Ephantus offers extension services to other farmers who are new in the business. Being a caring and loving father, Ephantus has been able to take care of his family and support them through the profits he has earned from farming. \r\n\r\nAlthough Ephantus reaps much profit from farming, one challenge that he is facing that is dragging him down and preventing him from reaching the top of the skies is lack of enough land to farm. For this reason, Ephantus is seeking a loan of KES 200,000 to buy a piece of land and expand his farming activities. Having so much experience in farming, Ephantus is sure that he will make good use of the land and double his profit levels.

","en":"Shamshod is a 28-year-old man, who is married and a father of three children. Shamshod could not get accepted to a university after completing school. He decided to get involved in business. Despite his young age, Shamshod decided to start his own business. He became involved in animal husbandry. Shamshod takes care of cattle on his land. He has a herd of 3 cows and a recently-born calf. Shamshod carefully cares for the newborn calf and feeds him milk from a bottle himself. Shamshod's wife sells the milk obtained from the cows at a market.

To provide the primary income for her family, Mariya has been involved in animal husbandry since 1985. Thanks to Mariya's hard work, today her farm contains 4 cows, 20 sheep and 2 horses. The monthly income amounts to about 21,000 som (KGS), but because this money is not enough for a decent life, she decided to expand her business. To further develop her business, Mariya requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy 3 cows for fattening up. Mariya plans to invest the earnings from the business into further increasing her livestock headcount and saving money to build a new

Over the last 20 years, he has been engaged in raising livestock. After graduating high school, Abdullojon decided not to enroll in a university and to begin working in order to help his parents. Now, on his plot of land he tends three cows and five sheep. Abdullojon likes his work very much. He likes to be out in the clean air. His wife helps him in his activities. Abdullojon works from morning until evening in order to earn a living and to support his family and children with a good future. Abdullojon applied to MDO Arvand for a loan with the aim of expanding his livestock count. Abdullojon hopes that MDO Arvand will approve his request and will provide the needed amount.

He grew up in a rural area, graduated from school and started to work in order to help his parents. He wanted to go to a technical college, but could not because there was no money to pay for the tuition. This is why Bahtiyar stayed with his parents. At the age of 20, after getting married, he started his own business in reselling cattle. Now Bahtiyar's herd contains fifteen sheep, three cows and one goat. He fattens up and resells livestock. Bahtiyar got used to working in the fresh air and taking care of the livestock. He came to MDO Arvand to request a loan in order to increase his livestock headcount. Bahtiyar is grateful in advance for the support and trust."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1815254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to increase his livestock headcount","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Mastchoh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-02-20T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-22T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":38.87,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bahtiyar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":598.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":640.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":651.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":671.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":700.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":736.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.07},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.12},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.42},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":711.13,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:22:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4047.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":38.87,"payment_id":666524428}],"funded_date":"2015-03-20T18:14:29Z","paid_date":"2015-06-21T12:22:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":837079,"name":"Olive","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olive, aged 28, is married and has two children aged 1 and 3 years.Her children don't go to school.

a hardworking man of 42 years. He was born and grew up in the village Navkent in the Shahrituz region. He is a group farmer and raises livestock. He is married and is the father of three children. By profession, he is a mechanic. <br \/><br \/>Eshonqul has been partnering with MDO Arvand since 2013. He breeds and sells cattle. His wife helps him in this work. She cares for the cattle, and also sells the milk received from them. The cattle-raising business brings Eshonqul a good and stable income. Therefore, he wishes to expand this business. He needs to buy another few head of cattle to grow and sell in the future. For this, Eshonqul applied to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to purchase livestock. He hopes that this business will successfully expand and bring more profits, in order to qualitatively meet the needs of the family. He is grateful to Arvand in advance for the
