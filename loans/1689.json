a man of 40 years, is married, and is the father of four children. Since childhood, he has been working in the field, tending domestic livestock, and growing fruits and vegetables. Murodjon would have liked to get a higher education, but his parents did not have the resources and therefore after he got married, he began working in agriculture. For the last 18 years, Murodjon on his own plot of land has been growing potatoes, carrots, wheat and cotton. He started with two hectares of land, and gradually over the years achieved now 25 hectares, where he also grows his crops which he sells at the market. His wife and sons help him.

He is a farmer by nature, and he has worked as a manager on different farms.  Today, thanks to the coming of Kiva lenders and Juhudi Kilimo to his territory, he can dream and aspire to better things for his wife and their children. Christopher is an accomplished farmer from the Litein area of Kenya and commands a lot of respect. He loves and cherishes his family. Christopher and his wife work as a team, supporting each other, and have practiced mixed farming for the past five years. Christopher often says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming, and it runs in my blood.\u201d Because of the liking that he has for farming, he has even nicknamed one of his cows, which makes him a very proud farmer, especially when he is milking his cows. From his dairy cow, he is able to get between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day, and this helps him support his family. Christopher also practices crop farming, but he has not been making good profits because of poor farming inputs; that is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm inputs. Through the loan, he will be able to buy high quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that he will use to greatly improve his crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques and therefore, using high-quality seeds will assure him of a bumper harvest and increased profit levels. Christopher is very visionary, and his goal for the season is to boost his crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year. All this can be achieved through the lenders\u2019 help and goodwill. Christopher believes that through the loan, he will turn around his family life and be able to give his children a solid education background. This loan will be Christopher\u2019s way out of poverty.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1817525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy high quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that he will use to greatly improve his crop production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-20T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-22T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.55,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2365.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2434.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2505.73},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2578.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2654.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2731.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2811.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2893.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2978.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3065.53},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3155.12},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3247.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3342.23},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3439.91},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3540.47},{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3643.91},{"due_date":"2016-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3750.41},{"due_date":"2016-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3860.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.47},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.31},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.04},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.89},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.85},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.84},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.85},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.9},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.98},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.09},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.23},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.41},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.62},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.2,"local_amount":5033.24,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5234.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265173},{"amount":28.86,"local_amount":2539.72,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2641.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459830},{"amount":29.95,"local_amount":2660.15,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2766.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"payment_id":681378208},{"amount":29.61,"local_amount":2648.07,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2753.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.48,"payment_id":696587913},{"amount":469.83,"local_amount":42118.82,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":43801.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.79,"payment_id":752111181}],"funded_date":"2015-03-21T21:23:56Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":842076,"name":"Pamie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Pamie, 52, a resident of Taguig City, Philippines.

Nathan lives with his wife and says that they only want to have more children when they are sure that they can raise them without worrying about where their next meal will come from or that the children would be forced to leave school because they can't provide for them.\r\n\r\nNathan owns a small plot of inherited land on which he has been practicing mixed farming for more than five years. He grows a variety of crops and keeps dairy cows and poultry. The income he makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet his family's expenses. He needs to improve his income level, and that is why he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow.\r\n\r\nNathan passionately loves dairy farming and, as he likes to put it, \u201cdairy farming is close to my heart.\u201d He plans to buy not just an ordinary cow but a quality breed of cow that will produce between 10-20 litres of milk a day. The additional milk will result in additional income and hence improved living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe income generated from selling the milk will be used to fully repay the loan and will also go towards the education of his children. He will also benefit from cow manure, which will be used to increase the fertility level of his farm, hence increasing productivity. Through the loan he will also be able to build a biogas digester that will be helpful in saving energy. This loan will completely change his life and improve his living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":257.77,"image":{"id":1817549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-20T21:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-22T21:20:19Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nathan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.39,"local_amount":8671.47,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":8729.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459831},{"amount":82.17,"local_amount":7590.5,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7641.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.33,"payment_id":696587914},{"amount":76.92,"local_amount":7171.08,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":7219,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.96,"payment_id":731023033}],"funded_date":"2015-02-27T17:35:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":842089,"name":"Moses","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moses is a 34-year-old married man who has a poultry farm that generates income for his family.

The members decided to use this name since it represents the place where they obtain water which is fundamental for their homes.\r\n\r\nThey have known each other for various years.  They support each other in whatever situation arises and they are women who are dedicated to their families.  In order to obtain a bit more income, each one of them carries out an occupation that they need to invest in:  Ma de los Angeles will invest in her mill; Maria Luciana in her grocery store; Maria Albina, Maxima, Ma Francisca and Leticia in lambs.\r\n\r\nFor her part, Juana is asking for a loan to buy replacement parts for her taxi. She is 46 years old, married to Sebastian and has five children of which only two depend on them--one daughter who is studying in high school and the other who is studying for her professional degree. \r\n\r\nThe idea of a taxi service came up out of necessity. In the community where Juana used to live there was only one bus that came by twice a day and she understood the difficulties that confronted all her neighbours due to this lack of transportation.  Juana has had several loan cycles with VisionFund Mexico.  The first investments she used to raise lambs and with her earnings she was able to buy an old-model vehicle to use as a taxi.  A while later, she even also bought a recent model car.  \u201cAll of this we achieved thanks to the efforts and dedication of my husband who drives the taxi but also with the help of VisionFund.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Sebastian works with the taxi every day, at home Juana works at raising lambs and selling natural products in order to continue supporting her daughters.  Her greatest dream is that they complete university and have better work opportunities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4700,"image":{"id":1811892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy replacement parts for her taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Lucas, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-02-20T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-22T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":4700,"lender_count":149,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Albina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"M\u00e1xima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":4700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":8750},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":8750},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8750},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8750},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":8750},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8750},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8750},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":8750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:51Z","rounded_local_amount":17526.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423914},{"amount":1175,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":17526.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769250},{"amount":1762.5,"local_amount":26250,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:19:29Z","rounded_local_amount":26290.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649764007},{"amount":587.5,"local_amount":8750,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":8763.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597533}],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T15:24:18Z","paid_date":"2015-06-18T13:25:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rita","image":null}},{"id":842084,"name":"Lilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilia works hard to support her family.

Because of the high unemployment rate, he ventured into farming, and he has never regretted this because of the profits he has been making. Wesley practices mixed farming and is regarded as one of the hardworking farmers in his village because he is able to juggle between keeping dairy cows and also doing banana and other crop farming. \r\n\r\nWesley is a visionary and enterprising person and has always wanted to do dairy farming on a large scale, but one of the challenges he has faced is lack of enough capital. That is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy a dairy cow. Through the loan Wesley is confident that his life will be transformed and his dream of providing a secure future for his siblings will be achieved. Wesley is relieved to know that his life can be secured through partners such as Kiva lenders who help small-scale and aspiring men such as Wesley.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":234.94,"image":{"id":1817604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-20T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-22T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.95,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wesley","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.85,"local_amount":8075.75,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":8314.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459832},{"amount":68.91,"local_amount":6224.77,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":6408.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.12,"payment_id":696587916},{"amount":72.23,"local_amount":6582.93,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6777.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.83,"payment_id":731023035}],"funded_date":"2015-03-15T15:33:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":842122,"name":"Betty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Betty needs credit to buy school bags and hand bags to sell.

Makhsud has always loved animals.  He has also been a client of MDO Arvand since March 2014.\r\n\r\nMakhsud has a dream:  he wants to build a big house for his family, but such a project requires a lot of money. His income is not sufficient to allow him to build a new house.  For this reason, Makhsud has turned to MDO Arvand and would like to receive a loan to buy building materials to build a house.

They all work towards getting ahead in life, and they help each other with this. They are doing the \u201cPoverty Stoplight\u201d program, and four of the members are in a situation of extreme poverty.\r\n\r\nThrough great effort and her continuing hairdressing work, Eusebia\u2019s situation is improving a little each day. She says that, with a lot of effort, she was able to set up her business and that it has been growing and improving, with some sacrifice on her part. She is a very hard-working and enterprising person and she is very good at what she does; for this reason, she has a very good clientele. \r\n\r\nEusebia is requesting this loan so she can buy some supplies for her hairdressing business, such as dyes, scissors, creams, shampoos, and rinses. In this way, she will be able to continue growing in her business and giving her clients good service.

is 53 years old.  She is not married but she has a son, Umed, who is now 30 years old.  Umed is currently making a living abroad.  Jamila herself lives and works in the city of Dushanbe.  She sells confectionery items at a market, in town.  Jamila enjoys her work, her relationships with the other market vendors, and the fact that she gets to meet new people every day.  Like all caring mothers, Jamila misses her son, but she finds some comfort and distraction in her work.  Jamila has only been working in this field for a year, but she has gained a good deal of experience.  She particularly strives to provide a fast and quality service to her customers.  Jamila would like to expand her activity, and for this reason, she has applied for a loan.  Thanks to this loan, she will be able to increase her turnover and consequently, her income.  Getting a loan is the only way she can improve her business, as she would not be able to achieve her goal without borrowing some money."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":583.77,"image":{"id":1816683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy confectionery items for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Dushanbe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.56 68.773889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-02-21T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-23T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":37.3,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jamila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":347.29},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":341.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":350.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":381.16},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":391.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":398.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":419.41},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":443.32},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":455.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":476.47},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":491.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":503.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.98},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.51},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.71},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.53},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.43},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.05,"local_amount":347.29,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":356.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.93,"payment_id":636348995},{"amount":61.28,"local_amount":341.58,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:11:17Z","rounded_local_amount":350.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.62,"payment_id":649621527},{"amount":63.06,"local_amount":350.04,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":358.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.45,"payment_id":665101498},{"amount":68.66,"local_amount":381.16,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":390.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.76,"payment_id":681399610},{"amount":70.26,"local_amount":391.23,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:25:34Z","rounded_local_amount":401.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.07,"payment_id":696609683},{"amount":70.54,"local_amount":398.46,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":408.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.17,"payment_id":711525710},{"amount":72.27,"local_amount":419.41,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":430,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.42,"payment_id":731041475},{"amount":75.35,"local_amount":443.32,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":454.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.88,"payment_id":752130446}],"funded_date":"2015-03-22T14:11:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":842161,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is a hardworking Ugandan married man of 52 years with three children living in Masindi, Uganda.

As an additional source of income for the family, Aliman and her husband are involved in animal husbandry and crop farming.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has five cows and 15 sheep on her farm.  She also grows clover on two hectares of her own land.  She makes up to 30,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further grow her farming business, Aliman has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep and increase her livestock headcount.

His salary, however, is not enough to meet the basic needs of his family. \r\n\r\nAs it becomes harder to earn a living over time, Vano wants to start an additional business in order to more effectively meet the daily costs of the family. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial condition and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Vano applied for the credit from MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is joint initiative with Kiva permitting the rural poor to start or restart businesses. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Vano plans to purchase all the needed tools and equipment and start furniture making. He has a small workshop near the house and will expand it for making more various kinds of furniture. Vano will get private orders and will sell his handmade items at the local market. \r\n\r\nHe is a very enthusiastic and hardworking person with a great desire to ensure his daughter has a good education for progressing in life. This credit will be a great support for the family. Vano is thankful to Kiva lenders for giving him a chance to generate income.

The reason that he didn't continue studying after that is that his father was elderly and his health started to deteriorate until he died.  From that moment, he took responsibility for the household to satisfy the needs of his family.  Since then, he has made a living farming and butchering pigs.  \r\n\r\nCarlos has 15 years of experience farming and he learned the business from his father who very proudly worked and cultivated the land.

Originally populated by nomadic tribes, such as \u201cLos Ayoreos\u201d, miners who relocated to Santa Cruz from the west of Bolivia have had children, and this second generation began trading and manufacturing work. With a tropical climate, the daily temperature here oscillates between 18 and 38\u00ba Celsius.\r\n\r\nRebeca has dark skin, and short, frizzy black hair. She is of medium height and has dark eyes and a robust physique. Her native language is Ayoreo, which she speaks with her family. She also speaks Spanish for her work. In the photo, Rebeca is wearing a yellow shirt and blue apron.\r\n\r\nRebeca shares her life with her partner, a builder. The couple lives in a room built with bricks, and with a roof made of metal sheeting. Their home has running water, electricity, and is connected to the sewer system.\r\n\r\nRebeca\u2019s desire to get ahead has brought her to lead a communal bank, comprising members who have the following businesses: transport services, selling vegetables, a locksmith\u2019s workshp, selling second-hand clothing, selling fried chicken, and a bakery.

always sell out.\u201d Rebeca\u2019s dream is to open a big eatery in her house. \r\n\r\nRebeca wants to buy chairs, tables and ingredients, such as corn and flour, to increase sales and expand her

Mamuka was working as a driver, but nowadays he is unemployed. The family are in the \"subsistence poor\" category as they have no source of income and live in poverty. This means that Mamuka lacks access to capital markets and financial institutions to obtain credit for starting a business, since this requires a stable income and business experience. The Start Up program created by Kiva and Credo enabled Mamuka to get a loan of 3,000 GEL to build a greenhouse. Once the greenhouse is built, Mamuka will grow tomatoes and resell them to generate income. With the support of the Start Up program, Mamuka will have the opportunity to be involved in his own business and tackle his financial difficulties.

She has a husband and a pensioner mother. Irine has a high education and works at a local public school, where she earns a small monthly income. She also works hard to generate additional income and takes care of cattle. However, her family has poor living conditions because they have no significant source of income. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nIrine requested a loan from Credo to open a general store. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions for business start-ups and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions for the country's rural poor, who are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income and who do not have access to traditional credit products. With this loan, Irine will purchase food supplies for her general store and have money for working capital. Her husband will help also help her.

However, thanks to her hard work recently, Anahit has been able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments for this loan. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

Meet Joash, a farmer in Nyamira. Joash is involved in maize, poultry and dairy farming. He is engaged in milk and egg production for commercial purposes as opposed to many rural farmers, who are in it for subsistence. Joash also grows maize for food and sales. These commercial activities place him in a better position to engage in other agriculture-related businesses, which, in fact, he does. \r\n\r\nJoash is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to construct a cow shed. This will help significantly in managing the animals\u2019 health and hygiene. He has been in the farming business for at least 10 years. He has no plans to quit in the future as he finds farming to be both fulfilling and lucrative. However, his biggest challenges are the poor road network and lack of market. The cow shed, constructed through this loan, will later come in handy when Joash scales up and introduces zero-grazing. The long-term impact is an increase in productivity and improved animal health. The additional income from this development will go to Joash's children\u2019s education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":219.85,"image":{"id":1817803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to construct a cow shed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-21T14:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-23T14:40:12Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.27,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joash","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":2357.05,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2516.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265174},{"amount":23.69,"local_amount":2030.56,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2168.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601307},{"amount":27.43,"local_amount":2351.28,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2510.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459834},{"amount":25.25,"local_amount":2184.24,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2332.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.23,"payment_id":681378210},{"amount":25.49,"local_amount":2219.76,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2370.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.41,"payment_id":696587918},{"amount":28.94,"local_amount":2595.87,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2771.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.35,"payment_id":711506189},{"amount":29.27,"local_amount":2572.28,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2746.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.74,"payment_id":731023037},{"amount":29.01,"local_amount":2533.27,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2704.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.54,"payment_id":752111183}],"funded_date":"2015-03-21T06:33:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":842292,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatuma is a married mother of three children, all of whom attend school.

Hailing from the Kapsowar area of Kenya, it isn't surprising that his career was destined to be elsewhere. Today, Charles has no regrets. He was persuaded by his father to stay in the village and start farming because there was a drop in crop yield and there was no one to look after their farm. For the past year, Charles has actively been involved in mixed farming; his primary sources of income have been crops and milk. He also engages in personal business to make ends meet. Charles sells crops to his neighbors and to the local market, although his work is not without challenges, he says. \r\n\r\nOf all the activities Charles is involved in, sheep farming is closest to his heart. The main challenge he faces is lack of funds to increase his flock of sheep. Sheep farming is a profitable business because wool prices have skyrocketed. Charles is an enterprising person and wants to take full advantage. From the loan he is seeking, he has already identified the breed of sheep he wants, a merino. The advantages of a merino sheep are their ease of care and that merino garments fetch high prices and are valued for their low propensity to smell bad. Through this loan, Charles will sell wool and be able to improve his living standards. Improved profits will be used to buy more stock and to secure his children's future. All that Charles waits for is your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":239.41,"image":{"id":1817817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a merino sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-21T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-23T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.49,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.1,"local_amount":2323.25,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2480.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265176},{"amount":26.01,"local_amount":2229.38,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2380.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601309},{"amount":28.08,"local_amount":2406.72,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2569.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459836},{"amount":31.64,"local_amount":2736.85,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2922.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.29,"payment_id":681378212},{"amount":31.05,"local_amount":2705.52,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2888.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.51,"payment_id":696587920},{"amount":26.53,"local_amount":2380.4,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2541.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.24,"payment_id":711506191},{"amount":33.12,"local_amount":2910.79,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3107.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.84,"payment_id":731023039},{"amount":32.39,"local_amount":2828.33,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3019.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.61,"payment_id":752111185}],"funded_date":"2015-02-23T03:14:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":842397,"name":"Flavio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flavio raises hogs and sheep on his farm, which he sells for their meat.

acquire several loans to make good profit from her business. At the age of 28, she is helping her husband to provide for their daily needs. She was inspired to improve their lives because she wants to give her children the best for their future. She works hard each day, and she is pretty sure that she is closer to reaching her goals.\r\n\r\nAnalyn owns a variety store. She believes that business is her stepping stone of making her dreams come to reality. She knows how important it is for her neighbors and daily consumers to have a nearby store where they can buy a sachet of shampoo, a bar of soap, 5 pesos' worth of cooking oil, an egg, toothpaste or even an ice tube. She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price, then she will sell them per piece for a higher price to have a profit. She also offers personal product items and maintains and operates a tricycle unit for additional profit.\r\n\r\nShe desires to manage a bigger store someday, so she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan, which she will use to buy additional groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She is positive that she will become a successful businesswoman in the future, and she looks forward to seeing her children finish their studies through all her hard work and perseverance.\r\n\r\nAnalyn meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1818114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries for her variety store, buy additional direct selling products and pay for the maintenance of her tricycle unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-02-21T16:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-23T16:20:08Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Analyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.36,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2361.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200784},{"amount":53.32,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2361.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187070},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2951.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536098},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1066.71,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1180.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017314}],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T16:45:18Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":842492,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah is 46 years old and has nine children.

to acquire several loans to make a good profit from her business. At age 55, she is helping her husband to provide for their daily needs and she was inspired to improve their lives because she wants to give her family a better future. She works hard each day and she is pretty sure that she is closer to reaching her goals.\r\n\r\nElvira owns a variety store. She believes that business is her stepping stone to making her dreams a reality. She knows how important it is for her neighbors and daily consumers to have a nearby store where they can buy shampoo, a bar of soap, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, an egg, toothpaste or even tube ice. She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price and then sells them per piece for a higher price to make a profit.\r\n\r\nShe desires to become successful someday so she is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP, which she will use to buy additional groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She is positive that she will become a successful businesswoman in the future and she looks forward to seeing her children finish their studies through all of her hard work and perseverance.\r\n\r\nElvira meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week. She can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1818127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy groceries and other supplies she needs to expand her store and increase her profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-02-21T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-23T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.01,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2213.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200785},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2951.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187071},{"amount":50.01,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2213.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536099},{"amount":66.64,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2951.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017315},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313752}],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T17:18:10Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elise Addis","image":null}},{"id":842504,"name":"Makkhara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Makkhara, 21, lives in a small community in Kampong Speu Province, Cambodia.

She is 35 years old and has three children who are already schooling. Her husband is working as a seaman and they are helping each other to provide for the needs of their children. Michelle oversees the operation of their Jeepney unit, and her income from the business is helping with their everyday needs and expenditures.<br \/><br \/>She has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) Jeepney, from which she is paid *boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,500 every day. Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the Jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines. <br \/><br \/>*In the boundary system, the driver pays the Jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay. <br \/><br \/>Michelle is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan assistance to renew the franchise and pay for the maintenance of her Jeepney unit. She will use the profit to improve the general living conditions of her family.<br \/><br \/>In the future, she wants another Jeepney unit to be used for their business operation. She also hopes to open and manage new business opportunities to add to her profit. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. <br \/><br \/>** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1818151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay for the maintenance and renewal of her jeepney franchise so she can continue to operate her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-02-21T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-23T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Michelle","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":933.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.01,"local_amount":2799.99,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2877.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200787},{"amount":86.68,"local_amount":3733.32,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3836.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187073},{"amount":65,"local_amount":2799.99,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2877.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536101},{"amount":108.31,"local_amount":4666.7,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4795.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017317}],"funded_date":"2015-02-21T18:50:33Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":842502,"name":"Heide","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Heide works hard to support her family.

Eris is the mother of a three-year-old little girl who is what motivates her in her life. \r\n\r\nShe started her business ten years ago when her father-in-law, who has 40 years of experience in retail stores, suggested this business to her. She decided to do so, starting with just a little capital and gradually growing the business with daily sales of groceries, typical fast food, soft drinks, beverages, dairy products, etc. She sells for cash and on credit equally and works ceaselessly from Monday through Sunday, starting at 6 a.m. and closing her shop at 9:30 p.m.  She sells directly to the consumer from her store, and the customers are mostly families who live in Eris' neighborhood. They buy just what they need each day to prepare the day's meals. Eris buys from wholesalers so she can get prices that allow her to be competitive with her own pricing and so that she can expand her market each day. \r\n\r\nDown the road, her goal is to convert her business to self-service and to remodel her home, although her biggest challenge is increasing sales and creating loyal customers by offering good prices and unparalleled service. She is currently asking for a Kiva loan which is the first time she is asking for financing from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. She will use the money to buy a new freezer and groceries to have a good inventory and to improve the image of quality for her customers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":349.36,"image":{"id":1819581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a freezer and groceries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-02-21T17:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-23T17:20:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":23.6,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":77513},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":117638},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":121168},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":124803},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":128547},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":132403},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":136375},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":140466},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":144680},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":149021},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":153491},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":158096},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":162839},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":167724},{"due_date":"2016-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":172756},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":177939},{"due_date":"2016-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":183277},{"due_date":"2016-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":251264}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.02},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.53},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.09},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.95},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.87},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.85},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.89},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.98},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.14},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.37},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.3,"local_amount":77513,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":78515.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649571898},{"amount":49.02,"local_amount":117638,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":119159.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666497263},{"amount":50.29,"local_amount":121168,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":122735.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.2,"payment_id":681350377},{"amount":46.62,"local_amount":124803,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:56:51Z","rounded_local_amount":126417.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.38,"payment_id":696560647},{"amount":47.33,"local_amount":128547,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":130209.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.23,"payment_id":711475394},{"amount":50.8,"local_amount":132403,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":134115.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.37,"payment_id":730994271},{"amount":49.4,"local_amount":136375,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":138138.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.42,"payment_id":752082232}],"funded_date":"2015-03-21T13:53:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":842535,"name":"Evans","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evans lives in Soweto, South Africa where he grew up.

With great strength, she has provided for her son, now an adult, the driving-force of her life, whom she intends to support a lot more through his studies. Her only income comes from her own independent work, which she does with much enthusiasm and with clear goals to be able to advance step by step. Her greatest challenge is not having the sufficient working capital to invest in technical infrastructure, improve the quality of her products and also to buy greater quantities of primary materials so that she can get special discounts.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a credikiva loan, the first funding she has applied for with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy a sewing machine and materials to improve her production and garment finishing. \r\n\r\nAlexis started her career as a seamstress by working in a workshop 15 years ago, along with her sister, where they learned the seamstress trade, saved up money and later became independent. To this day she has not stopped with this trade and makes bags, clothing for families and sells goods such as accessories that elegantly accompany her other products.

He is now married and has 7 children. \r\n\r\nThrough much effort, he bought his land and also inherited the land of his father, and little by little he has been able to raise his livestock. However, in the area where he lives it is hot and he has little forested area where he can obtain firewood to cook. He does not want to continue depleting his small area of forest and for this reason he is applying for a loan to buy a Biodigester for the production of gas in order for Domitila to cook with greater ease and without exposure to health risks caused by the smoke from cooking with firewood. \r\n\r\nHe also states that in addition to not filling the home with smoke, he will no longer cause deforestation and the area will be reforested so that firewood is available if some is needed. He would be thankful if he is provided with the opportunity to have this loan to be able to set up the Biodigester.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1819674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy a Biodigester","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":279,"posted_date":"2015-02-21T20:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-23T20:00:06Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rigoberto ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":962.81,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":223.38},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":234.55},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":246.28},{"due_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":258.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.21},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.52},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.4},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":261.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":962.81,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T11:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624403894}],"funded_date":"2015-02-22T13:44:41Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T11:21:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Verna Krishnamurthy","image":1691630}},{"id":842575,"name":"Yean's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yean\u2019s group live in a rural village in Kandal province in Cambodia.
