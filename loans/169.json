She lives in the town of Malambo with her husband and 9 year old son. She has a variety store in her house, where she sells women's accessories, paper products, beauty items and other merchandise, according to the season. Her enterprising experience began 15 years ago, when, using her creativity, she started her business. She made artisanal crafts with her own hands, taking advantage of the fact that her spouse worked in a store. He made commercial contacts in the small communities nearby and built their own clientele. Finally, less than 2 years ago, when her husband stopped working in the store, they invested his severance package in a variety store. They mixed their own products and various merchandise. They started selling via orders and later sold according to each season. \r\n\r\nDilsa's creativity knows no limits, nor does her desire to learn. Besides making products out of materials such as leather, she also learned to make sandals, which she displays in her store with much pride. Her business is growing gradually, because her clientele has expanded. This is the reason why she has turned to a Kiva loan, the first loan she has taken out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy toys, taking advantage of the Christmas season. Usually she has a lot of orders from her customers, especially for toys, given to children for the birth of the Christ child. They receive them with much joy and they play in the streets of town. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":939881,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy toys","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-10T14:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":75798},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80063},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":81931},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83843},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85799},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87801},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89850},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91946},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94092},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96287},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":98534},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":104056}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.03},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.03},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.95},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.73,"local_amount":75798,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:02Z","rounded_local_amount":78491.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188777},{"amount":43.03,"local_amount":80063,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":82908.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324982},{"amount":44.03,"local_amount":81931,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":84842.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039043},{"amount":45.05,"local_amount":83843,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":86822.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651188},{"amount":46.11,"local_amount":85799,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":88848.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140794},{"amount":47.18,"local_amount":87801,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":90921.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100697},{"amount":48.28,"local_amount":89850,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":93043.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338317},{"amount":260.59,"local_amount":484915,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":502147.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356498066}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T16:02:43Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:43:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":373071,"name":"Lourdesita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lourdesita is married and has five children.

They live in Ticuantepe, an agricultural area with a high potential for eco tourism. For the last 30 years, she and her husband have dedicated themselves to growing the most predominant crop in the area, pineapple, as well as, bananas, oranges, lemons and mandarins (citrus). The municipality has excellent farming conditions because of the climate and arable land, both favourable for agriculture. This is how these parents prepared their children, who are university students preparing themselves for a better life.\r\n\r\n<p>She explains that the production process of different crops includes chemical control of bushes, as the crops need to be free of them to develop properly; to this end, 3 cycles of chemical control -- herbicides and man power -- are needed during this process. Unfortunately, this process is expensive and Darling can't afford it at the moment.  She needs a loan to cover the costs, as the success of her crops depend on it. <b><p>Translated by Beatriz Yuste, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><b>\r\n\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Darling aprendi\u00f3 de su esposo el oficio de la agricultura, quien desde muy joven ha trabajado en el campo, habitan en Ticuantepe una zona altamente productiva con un alto potencial para el ecoturismo.

Es de esta manera como estos padres han preparado a sus 2 hijos quienes se encuentran estudiando en la universidad, prepar\u00e1ndose para un mejor futuro.\r\n\r\n<p>La se\u00f1ora explica que el proceso productivo de los diferentes cultivos requieren de un control qu\u00edmico para la  malezas de las plantaciones durante el desarrollo vegetativo, ya que requieren estar libre de malezas; para ello se debe realizar por lo menos tres controles qu\u00edmicos a lo largo de todo el proceso, a base de herbicidas combinadas con controles manuales y esto tiene un alto costo que ella no puede

With the readily available animal feed in her house and her experiences in raising livestock, the project was very successful. The subsequent loans were also used to invest in rearing pigs. Now, Mrs. Tam's family has a pig sty up to standard with about 20 pigs. Beside raising livestock, Mrs. Tam also sells vegetables in the market everyday. This also brings about a stable income for her family. Mrs. Tam has a daughter who is working with a stable monthly income of 2,000,000VND (about 125USD) so every month, Mrs. Tam receives financial support from her daughter. Wishing to improve her family's standard of living, Mrs. Tam would like to borrow 15,000,000VND (900USD) to invest in raising livestock.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Yen Thanh

","en":"Dilfuza is a young woman of 31.  She is married and the mother of two children.  She has a grocery store named Nigina in downtown Kairakkum.  Her husband handles the delivery of groceries to stock the store. He purchases goods from Khujand's Panchshanbe market, because products are cheaper there.  He has a passenger car that he uses to make the deliveries to the store.  Dilfuza began by selling small items on the street. Using credit, she expanded her business, and now she has a small store of her own.   With her next loans she wants to increase the variety of goods as the demand for other products is great. Dilfuza is grateful to the finance institution for its assistance in developing her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva

This helps them to save some money as well as make sure they have enough food for several months.\r\n<p>\r\nIvan started this business 19 years ago. He has many repeat clients who buy from him.

She is 33 years old. Roselyn is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRoselyn is married and has 1 school-aged child. To make a living, Roselyn owns & operates a specialized retail store primarily selling daily use products such as shampoo, candies, biscuits, noodles, coffee, sugar, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Roselyn has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Roselyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Roselyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Roselyn is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Roselyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

He is married and has seven children. They live together in their own home located in the town of Rosario, in the Ayacucho district. For Juan, his work has always been tied to agricultural activity, and he has been expanding in this activity for approximately 50 years. He cultivates cacao, coffee, and citrus fruits. During the growing and harvest seasons, he needs workers to complete these tasks with less time and cost, but usually he is at his farm caring for his crops in the face of any plague of insects that might affect his products. Normally he sells his products in the Collection Centers of his community, but he sells his fruit in the city of Ayacucho.

She is requesting a loan to buy supplies, such as silk thread of various colors, and to buy fish. \r\n\r\nTomasa's dreams are to acquire a market stall in Lolotique to sell her fish, to improve her sales, and to improve her family's quality of life. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":573220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buying supplies to make hammocks, such as silk thread in various colors, and buying fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Lolotiquillo, Morazan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomasa Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":13.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":14.28},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":14.93},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15.07},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":16.03},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":16.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":16.78},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":17.63},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":17.59},{"due_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18.79},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":19.1},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":19.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.28},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.93},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.07},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.03},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.63},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.59},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.79},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.1},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":23.84,"local_amount":23.84,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":23.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166894924},{"amount":25.67,"local_amount":25.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":25.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172162942},{"amount":15.46,"local_amount":15.46,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":15.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177458822},{"amount":15.96,"local_amount":15.96,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":15.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182596868},{"amount":16.8,"local_amount":16.8,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T10:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":16.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189181603},{"amount":16.64,"local_amount":16.64,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":16.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191474439},{"amount":17.68,"local_amount":17.68,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":17.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195900235},{"amount":17.96,"local_amount":17.96,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:48:34Z","rounded_local_amount":17.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201339604},{"amount":18.9,"local_amount":18.9,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":18.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206209623},{"amount":31.09,"local_amount":31.09,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":31.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216565055}],"funded_date":"2010-08-01T15:01:08Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:42:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":221431,"name":"Nghi\u00eam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"H.

Uguloy is 40 years old, married and has four children. With her husband, she runs a business buying and selling cows. She would like to secure a loan of $900 for nine months in order to buy additional cows to increase her inventory and meet customer demand. She believes this will lead to greater revenue and, ultimately, greater profit for her family. In the future, she would like to reinvest the earnings generated by this loan back into her business to purchase even more cows and increase her income even further.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. Civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Na Some is a villager in Chan Teab village in Takeo province. She is a farmer who owns a small piece of land to cultivate rice to earn for living. Aside from this, she is a breeder who raises cow and pigs. Since breeding business is going well, she wants to expand it so she decided to ask for a loan to buy one more cow and four piglets and she would use the rest of the loan to buy pig food to support her pig.

was born in 1976 and is married with three children aged between 3 and 15 years. She and her family live in the Western Province of Rwanda, approximately three hours drive from Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda.\r\n\r\nDancille\u2019s village, called Nyabihu, is where, since 2007, she has owned her business selling women\u2019s clothes. The hours of her business are from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day except Sunday.\r\n\r\nAlthough this hardworking businesswoman has been in her business for three years, her profit is still too low to expand the business meaningfully and she believes that a small amount of additional capital would change her business positively.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, Dancille is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders via Vision Finance Company in order to purchase more clothes to sell so that she will be able to satisfy the demands of her customers.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Dancille hopes that she will become more efficient, effective and successful. She thanks VFC and Kiva lenders for their support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":477780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more clothes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Gisenyi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-01-27T00:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dancille","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:50:19Z","rounded_local_amount":130332.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118169451},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:45Z","rounded_local_amount":26066.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022772},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":39099.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152781838},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":39099.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709718},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T09:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":39099.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167037082},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":39099.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172308808}],"funded_date":"2010-01-27T01:42:05Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T09:44:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":175966,"name":"Ihab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ihab is a 20-year-old single man who has been working as a car repairman for the past eight years after stopping his education.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ihab opened his own car repair shop to earn income to help satisfy his life needs and to support his family.

She lives in Prk. San Juan, Brgy. Patao, Bantayan, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing materials business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000. Galicana is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she could fund her business operations. This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Galicana aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. In the photo, you will see her husband helping her run the business. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

The women live in a small community which is located on a road, opposite a fishing dam.  The community is called Concepci\u00f3n Chico.  It is locally known as 'La Concha' (The Shell).  This is why the group, which is made up entirely of women, decided to give themselves the name 'Las Conchitas' (The Little Shells).\r\n\r\nSeveral of this group's members will invest their loan money in commercial activities: Francisca (a small store), Maria (a corn mill), Valentina (a store) and Maricela (selling shoes through a catalog).  The rest of the ladies, Maria Eleuteria, Maria Irene, Maria Modesta, Rosa Felipa and Maria Guadalupe, will invest their loan money in buying corn mills since milling corn is an activity which is very much in demand.  Everybody grows corn and, in order to give it to their animals as feed, they need to mill it.  There aren't mills to do this.\r\n\r\nThis group's representative is called Ana Luisa.  She raises chickens to sell and she tells us the following about her business: \"My business is raising chickens and sometimes turkeys.  I would like to invest in buying chickens and also build a chicken coop so that they have somewhere to sleep and protect themselves from the weather.  One problem that I have had with my animals is that, because I don't have anywhere to keep them, they disappear and then I can't find them and I lose them.  I also have to vaccinate them so that they don't get flu.  This loan will be very helpful to me because I have a son who is in elementary school and I will be able to help him by paying for some of the stationery supplies that he needs.  My goal is to build my own home because I live with my partner in my mom's house.  I am not married but I have a common-law marriage.  My partner is a construction worker.  First I would like to save up and buy a plot of land and then build.  My business is important because it means I can start to earn, even if it's just a little bit of money, and start saving\".\r\n\r\nNote: Maria C.

Dengan kredit yang diperoleh, ia manfaatkan untuk pembelian 2 ekor Induk  dan pakan ternak. Selama 6 bulan masa pemeliharaan Induk Babi ini akan melahirkan rata-rata 8 ekor. Sehingga dengan demiki selama 6 bulan pemeliharaan Ni Nyoman Wati menghasilkan 16 ekor anak babi yang bisa dijual dengan harga Rp. 250.000.- per ekor. Dari hasil penjualan keuntungan yang akan diperolah sebanyak Rp.1.000.000.- per bulan. Keuntungan itu ia manfatkan untuk memenuhi kebutuhan hidup keluarganya.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has six school-aged children.  Faasao owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting bananas for sale.  Faasao has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 350 tala WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Faasao joined Kiva partner SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Faasao's request for a loan of 1000 tala WST, which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment, is her first loan request.  Faasao plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her highest level of formal education is the completion of 3rd grade.\r\n\r\nThe loan consultant that has been working with Erika has described her as a hardworking, honest, sincere, noble woman with a battling spirit. This will be her first loan with Fundacion Mujer. Erika is applying for this loan in an effort to gain financial independence as well as to earn an income to help her sister Karol raise her child, who has special needs.\r\n\r\nErika's determination is exemplified by her daily work routine. She has dedicated the last five years of her life to selling newspapers in the morning while working as a masseuse in the afternoon. Recently, an opportunity to purchase the newspaper stand and license where Erika and her sister work, has presented itself. Erika plans to use this loan to purchase the newspaper vendors license from the Costa Rican government, for 250,000 colons, and also the newsstand itself.\r\n\r\nAs owner, Erika will be able to earn more revenues and better support herself, her immediate family and her sister. The newspaper stand is located diagonally to the Legislative Assembly in a densely populated pedestrian zone of San Jose where many locals have become accustomed to purchasing their daily newspapers.\r\n\r\nErika and her sister sell papers from 6 a.m. to noon everyday or until they run out of papers. In an average good month Erika can earn 290,000 colons selling papers.\r\n\r\n\r\nErika\u2019s goals are to earn enough money from the newsstand to provide a quality standard of living for her family. In the long term she would like to open a beauty salon.\r\n\r\nAlthough she would like to be able to sell more than just newspapers at her stand, this would require the purchase of another expensive license. Erika mentions this as one of the main deterrents to the growth of her business. The good news is that her papers are selling fast, and often she is sold out by 8 in the morning!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":477851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Esther will educate her children and invest in raising livestock.\r\n\r\nIn the above photograph, Esther is pictured with her group members."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":914899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T04:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janepher","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peninah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":55300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":55300,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":55314.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680717}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T16:45:33Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":360828,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This borrower is from Iraq.

Norma has a variety of business ventures.  On Sundays, she sells barbecued meats from her home in the small town of Yarinacocha, a suburb of the city of Pucallpa.  She hopes to invest this loan of 1000 soles in used clothing, which she will exchange for food grown in the small communities along the Ucayali, a wide brown river that flows past Pucallpa and eventually joins the Amazon to the north.  Norma will then sell these agricultural products in Pucallpa.\r\n\r\nNorma and her family (her husband and their two daughters, aged 15 and 24) are the caretakers for a home and office building near the center of the city of Pucallpa.  They live there during the week.  Norma serves lunch in her kitchen every weekday to a variety of regular customers.  Norma's husband works as a regional representative for a security company.  \r\n\r\nNorma has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for more than eight years.  She has used past loans to purchase a sewing machine and sewing materials.  Norma used to do clothing repairs and sew undergarments and children's clothing.  She has not been able to engage in this work recently due to an eye operation but hopes to begin again by September, at which time her eye is expected to be fully healed.  \r\n\r\nNorma very much appreciates her loans from Manuela Ramos.  She told me that these loans help women to become independent, and to feel that they are strong and are contributing to society.  With the establishment of their own businesses, women no longer have to wait for their husbands' paychecks.\r\n\r\nNorma's goal is to keep working in order to continue paying for her youngest daughter's education.  She wants to enable her daughter to go to college and have a professional career.  She also wants to be able to do some repair work on her house.

Lonise is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Lonise plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

She owns a plot of land where she cultivates rice to earn a living. In this plantation, she faces some problems because her field is far from an irrigation system and the soil is not very fertile.

They are happy to be part of this group. They are currently headquartered in the community of Chalco, in the State of M\u00e9xico.\n\nThis borrower is Edith R. R., age 53 (the one in the navy blue sweatshirt). She has a daughter who is 22 and currently working, since she could not continue her studies due to a lack of income in the household. They only have each other for support, since Edith does not receive support from her partner. Edith is a person who has always had to work to get ahead and to buy her medicines, since she suffers from asthmatic bronchitis, but this does not stop her from continuing to work hard. Her business is selling cleaning products such as brooms and fibers out of her home, and also selling secondhand clothing and shoes at the markets near her community. She lays out blankets to display the clothes. At times her business is affected by rain and she sells less. Her best sales days are the weekends. She tries to stock new merchandise every three days so she can offer variety to her customers. With the loan she is requesting, she will buy a little more clothing for her business, along with cleaning products. Her plans for the future are to construct a small extra room in her home and to see her daughter return to her studies so that she can have a better future. \n\nThe other members of this group are:  \nMar\u00eda Trinidad J.

She is a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Romeo A., a construction foreman, and is the mother of four elementary-aged children, all of whom are currently enrolled this year. By the grace of God, Rose has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send them all the way through college -- a dream for most Filipino parents like Rose as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nRose operates a food stall while doing sideline work as a manicurist. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only the usual family tradition but is also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use up cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands (prepared dishes) cost less than raw food. She also generates income from manicure and pedicure services. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php16,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy raw ingredients for her food business and other materials needed for her manicure and pedicure services. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRose dreams to be able to give her all her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship* co-members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":597053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Buy

Her greatest challenge is the insufficiency of her working capital that does not allow her to buy large volumes of the products she needs to prepare her meals.\r\n\r\nThis is why she\u2019s calling on her Kiva loan to buy rice, oil and raw materials in large volume to continue growing because her dream is to have a house of her own and a well-structured, comfortable restaurant where her customers can enjoy the food Mayra prepares.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":839147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, oil and raw materials in larger amounts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-10T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":70437},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":76259},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":77721},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":79211},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":80729},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":82276},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83853},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85460},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":87098},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88768},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90469},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":97719}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.85},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.69},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.55},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.3},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.08},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.5,"local_amount":70437,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":71403.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803713},{"amount":43.85,"local_amount":76259,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":77305.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614790},{"amount":90.24,"local_amount":156932,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":159085.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780073},{"amount":93.72,"local_amount":163005,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:39Z","rounded_local_amount":165242.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324682},{"amount":97.36,"local_amount":169313,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":171636.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650906},{"amount":100.45,"local_amount":174689,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":177086.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338078},{"amount":50.08,"local_amount":87096,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":88291.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301394690},{"amount":58.8,"local_amount":102269,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":103672.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994472}],"funded_date":"2011-08-18T22:18:32Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:55:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":328032,"name":"Mario","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mario is 47 years old and lives in Sto.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Saimuhammad now needs a 10 000 Somoni loan which he will use to buy goods to respond to his customers\u2019 demands. Saimuhammad is very thankful to you to help him improve his service and the quality of life of his family.   \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For a living she buys and sells bananas. Therefore she gets up very early every day to go to the port where she buys bananas from the farmers to sell on the local market or at the port itself. She has been doing this for 5 years and is doing well. She also likes it and does not need physical effort and she only works specific hours. On the other hand \r\nbusiness is profitable as this fruit is popular as it is used in almost all the regional daily dishes. For the future Nene would like to purchase a stall at the market to set up her business so she does not have to sell in an informal way. This is her 2nd loan with MFP and she likes to work with her community bank as there are no problems with the members and all are very responsible with their payments. With the money she will buy bunches of bananas for 1000 soles and the rest will be invested in her husband's fishing business to buy nets, floats and other material needed for his work.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lene Struck Christensen, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":353158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise and invewst in husband's business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-17T22:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":270.23},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":281.42},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":291.36},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":307.69},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":317.82},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":331.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.08},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.81},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.94},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":90.08,"local_amount":270.23,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":272.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63212013},{"amount":93.81,"local_amount":281.42,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":283.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641548},{"amount":97.12,"local_amount":291.36,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":293.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080988},{"amount":102.56,"local_amount":307.69,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":309.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997127},{"amount":105.94,"local_amount":317.82,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:34Z","rounded_local_amount":319.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842483},{"amount":110.49,"local_amount":331.48,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:09Z","rounded_local_amount":333.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734061}],"funded_date":"2009-07-18T01:11:06Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"lene struck","image":881505}},{"id":126407,"name":"Emmanuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from K.

The loan will be her 4th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

He hopes, through this loan, his family will experience a comfortable life where he will be able to provide good education, food and clothing for his family.\r\n\r\nIn five years time, Bernard hopes to expand his farming activities by acquiring four more dairy cows and a pick-up for transporting his milk to his client.\r\n\r\nBernard says Juhudi Kilimo came as a blessing and his group members are able to acquire dairy cows which is very encouraging.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":540789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase and insure a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2010-05-16T13:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":31200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":2600,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:59:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2606.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151920609},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":2602,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2608.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159660976},{"amount":19.64,"local_amount":1532,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1535.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166875252},{"amount":1.69,"local_amount":132,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":132.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172142227},{"amount":38.87,"local_amount":3032,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3039.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177437055},{"amount":160.67,"local_amount":12532,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:33:36Z","rounded_local_amount":12564.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182576453},{"amount":45.79,"local_amount":3570,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-21T08:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3579.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202029931},{"amount":60.67,"local_amount":4732,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:11:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4744.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221858397},{"amount":6,"local_amount":468,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":469.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294600273}],"funded_date":"2010-05-16T21:57:01Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:56:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":205109,"name":"Heng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Heng S. is 47 years old and lives in the province of Kompong Tom in Cambodia, which is about 200 km from Phnom Penh along National Road No. 6.

Amparo joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1993 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amparo has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 1,300, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use as funds for business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Amparo is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is a small-holder farmer based in Wiyeta village in the Kitale area of Kenya. Everlyne has been practicing livestock farming for seven years. She has raised two cows on the farm. \n\nEverlyne is seeking a loan to restock her cereals business. She plans to purchase and transport cereals in bulk to far markets where she will sell at prices high enough to cover all the expenses incurred while gaining a profit.

He and his wife sell personal care products.  These include shampoo, tooth paste, hair coloring, products to take care of the body and many other things.  Demand for these types of products is high and brings steady profits.  In addition to selling his products at the markets, Zafar sells his products from home where he has a small store.  Recently his business had a hard period, when the tax authorities demanded that he get a special license to sell self-care products.  The costs of such a license are too high and would not have allowed Zafar to earn a profit.  This type of license is used for wholesale dealers.  Today, the issue has been resolved and the special license is not necessary.  <p>\r\n\r\nA year ago Zafar received a loan from MicroInvest and included more expensive shampoos and soaps in his inventory.  This attracted many customers and increased profits.  He purchases his products by traveling to wholesale markets and also receives deliveries from wholesale dealers.  Business is going very well and Zafar would like to take out a new loan to purchase additional products.  <p>\r\n\r\nZafar\u2019s wife is pictured in the photo.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian
