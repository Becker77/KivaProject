He will use the capital to provide more mobile payment services to his community, especially on weekends.

He joined Ruma in 2013 and this is the second time that he is asking for a loan from Kiva.

He will use the capital to provide more mobile payment services to his community, especially on the weekends. This loan is very important. Your loan will be very useful to help Berhanen improve his business and, accordingly, his community who needs access to such services.

He is married and lives in a rural area. Like many rural residents, he works fattening and breeding livestock. He decided on this occupation at a young age, when he was still in school. His father worked in animal husbandry and taught his son how to care for livestock. Hurshedjon was also unable to finish school due to family financial difficulties, so he started tending animals and didn't have any time left to study. Once he reached adulthood, he decided to start his own business fattening livestock and gradually was able to increase his working capital.\r\n\r\nCurrently, all of Hurshedjon's money is invested in his animals and he doesn't have enough to pay for feed. Livestock prices have fallen and he can't sell his animals without a loss. With this challenge in mind, he decided to approach Arvand for financial support. He wants to buy livestock feed with the loan amount. He thanks lenders in advance for their financial support of rural residents in poverty."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1816631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to fatten and breed cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

She is the mother of 7 children who are between the ages of 2 and 26. They live in a community in Solola.\r\n\r\nJuana is a woman who dedicates herself to her work so that she and her family can prosper. Even though she lives in a remote community, she does not waste time. Juana's mother taught her good principles: in order to prosper in life, one has to work and earn an income. With this mentality, Juana has made a living buying and selling vegetables at her community market for the past 10 years. She chose this work because buyers from nearby places who need fresh and cheap vegetables travel to the community where she lives to buy. She is a street vendor, as she does not have a formal stall.\r\n\r\nJuana is a mother who worries about the well-being of her family. She has realized that she needs to build a house in order to give her family a better life. Unfortunately, the earnings that she obtains are not enough. It is for this reason that she decided to request a loan, which she will use to buy construction materials such as sand, cement, brick, and iron. Juana's dream is to build her house this year so that she can give her children a sense of community and a better life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1819698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy sand, cement, brick, and iron.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2015-02-21T23:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-23T23:40:05Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500.01},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500.01},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":499.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.8,"local_amount":501,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":510.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636134526},{"amount":67.04,"local_amount":502.8,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":512.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649489622},{"amount":66.8,"local_amount":501,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":510.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664972056},{"amount":66.54,"local_amount":499.02,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":508.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681267594},{"amount":66.72,"local_amount":500.39,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":510.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696477453},{"amount":466.1,"local_amount":3495.79,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3564.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711385064}],"funded_date":"2015-02-25T20:08:15Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T12:18:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gabriela L."}},{"id":842663,"name":"Nhanh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A villager from a rural area located in the Siem Reap province\u2019s Sot Nikom district, Nhanh is 26 years old and married with two children, who are still small.

She is single, without children, and her second business is tending a neighborhood store that sells foods of primary necessity.\r\n\r\nShe is entrepreneurial, attentive, friendly, gracious, responsible, and hard-working. She runs her business in the Kiswaras zone, characterized by urbanization that began at the time of the social changes of the agrarian reform and produced a migration from the countryside to the city, populating it in a disorganized way and with multiple problems of urbanization. It has a cold and dry climate with an ambient temperature that varies between 0 - 12 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n\r\nDora has a dark complexion, long, black hair that she braids, dark eyes, thin physique, and short stature. Her form of dress is traditional (hat, shawl, and skirt). Her native language is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks in the area, and she speaks Spanish because of general culture and for the business that she does. She shares her life with her mother, who works and along with her sister has another business. They live in their own house, which is made of bricks and adobe with a tile roof and potable water, electricity, domestic gas, and sewer service.\r\n\r\nHer business is tending to a neighborhood store with foods of primary necessity, such as sugar, rice, pasta, freeze-dried potatoes, bread, soft drinks, etc. She does this work during the afternoon until night. During the morning she has another business, which is selling food. She is busy cooking lunch every day to serve it in her restaurant located in her same residence. Both businesses occupy all her time. \"I learned to cook when I was a very young girl when I helped my mother. With time I was encouraged to open my neighborhood store. Both businesses are profitable, and my customers are steady,\" she comments.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to generate greater income with both businesses. She wants to stock her neighborhood store with foods of primary necessity to have a greater offering of products. This is her first loan with the institution in the five years that she has been running both businesses. It is for these motives that Dora is requesting a loan to stock her neighborhood store with foods of primary necessity to increase her offerings and generate greater earnings.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":610.02,"image":{"id":1819729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

like Fabiano.  He is 49 years old and has been happily married to Jane for the last 20 years, they have three children. \r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years Fabiano has operated a 1-acre mixed farm in Uruku village located in the Central Province of Kenya.  He keeps dairy cattle and grows maize, vegetables, and other crops on his farm.  He also engages in other side businesses for additional income.  He is constantly upgrading and introducing new ways and approaches of doing business to make his farm more sustainable to the environment while still being profitable. \r\n\r\nFabiano is seeking a loan to fully incorporate zero-grazing into his farm. The cattle management system on his farm is shifting from being extensive (which is confined in ranches and large-scale farms) to being intensive.  The intensive systems are the most predominant and comprise zero-grazing and semi-zero grazing systems.  \r\n\r\nWith your funding, the introduction of zero-grazing will create significant value for Fabiano's business.  This management system is the most suitable for this farmer, considering his land, labour, and capital.  Returns from this investment will be put back in to the business to drive its evolution into a modern practice.  Your loan will elevate the quality of life for Fabiano and his family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":655.42,"image":{"id":1818462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start zero grazing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-22T04:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-24T04:00:04Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.48,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fabiano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":7772.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5661.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5827.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5997.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6172.89},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6353.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6538.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6730.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6926.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":7129.18},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":7337.53},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":7551.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.93},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.49},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.52},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150.58,"local_amount":13767.51,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":13780.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265178},{"amount":63.51,"local_amount":5806.27,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5811.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601311},{"amount":69.47,"local_amount":6351.78,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:46Z","rounded_local_amount":6357.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459837},{"amount":71.28,"local_amount":6577.7,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6584.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.66,"payment_id":681378214},{"amount":68.67,"local_amount":6380.56,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6386.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.12,"payment_id":696587921},{"amount":72.29,"local_amount":6918.54,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6925.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.38,"payment_id":711506193},{"amount":73.25,"local_amount":6867.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":6873.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.86,"payment_id":731023041},{"amount":77.89,"local_amount":7254.52,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":7261.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.46,"payment_id":752111186}],"funded_date":"2015-03-23T13:27:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mark McDermott","image":1404670}},{"id":842760,"name":"Marilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilyn is 58 years old and has three children.

She is married to Aldrin, a vendor, and has four children of which one is a college student, one is a high school student, one is in the elementary level, and the other one is not of school age yet. She manages their own household while operating a business. She works hard to augment their income for their daily sustenance and for the schooling of her children.\r\n\r\nMelchie has a rag-making business. She makes and sells rags for different uses and various sizes. There are round palm sized ones to clean cabinets and kitchen counter to large doormats. In the Philippines, rags are a major housekeeping and cleaning item, and every household has them. Filipino households constantly change and buy clean rags to keep their houses clean and presentable. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Aside from her rags, she also sells accessories and herbal oil. She earns a minimum of 800 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy additional materials like fabric, thread for her rag business and partly to pay for accessories which she sells. She is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment, and the financial help that will be given her for it will surely help cover their daily needs and fund her children's education.\r\n\r\nMelchie hopes to sustain her business and desires to send all her kids to college.

She lives with her husband and has a son who is 5 years old and two daughters who are 10 and 11. She has a business selling bread. She developed her business in a market in the town of Sacaba, a rural area characterized by its role as the granary of the city because of its production of cereals, vegetables and fruits even in the urban districts. It has a warmsemi-tropical climate with temperatures that vary during the day between 12-28 degrees C. \r\n\r\nRocsana has brown skin, she is short and she has long black hair that she keeps in a pony tail. She has dark eyes, a robust physique and her native language is Quechua which she speaks at home and she speaks Spanish as part of the wider culture and the sales that she completes. (In the photo she is standing in the back row wearing a white blouse. She is the first on the right). She shares her life with her husband who works in construction, and with her children who study in school. They live in a rented room constructed out of adobe with a corrugated iron roof and access to well water and electricity. She dreams of increasing her earnings led her to join a bank of people with businesses such as: upholstery, food sales, potato sales, hired transportation, clothing sales, cosmetics sales via catalogue and the sale of breakfasts. They are seeking a loan to meet their goals. \r\n\r\nRocsana has a business selling bread. She takes care of distributing the variety of breads that the baker leaves her. This is a job that she does 3 times per day because this is the way she completes her sales. The baker's work  is completed in a stall in the open market. Rocsana's clients are constant and come every day. \"I began my business out of the need to work. My children help me to transport the bread from the bakery. Sometimes the baker is late and the customers make a line until the bread arrives...\" she told us. Her dream is to open a big restaurant where she could have employees and be able to rest.

He has worked in this profession for 4 years and thanks to this work he has been able to get his family ahead. However, Daniel is not a conformist man and because of this he also works in agriculture to make other earnings. Because of the little resources he had when he constructed his home he was not able to install electricity and it is because of this that for several years they have not had electricity. Now he sees the need for this service because it will help his children who are studying. However, one of the limitations Daniel faces is that he does not have enough money to order this service. It is because of this situation that he, together with his wife, decided to seek a loan to use to pay for the installation of electricity in his home. Daniel hopes that he can count on this loan so that his family can get the electricity it needs. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1819876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to pay to install electricity.

They keep livestock of cows, calves, sheep, and hens, as well as cultivate wheat and barley. To be able to enlarge their farm production, Nvard asks for this loan.

However, thanks to her hard work during the recent times, Nvard was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. <br \/><br \/>So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International.

Tangulu has received secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, she raises livestock, having launched this business seven years ago. At present Tangulu has a cow with a calf, a horse and 10 sheep on her farm. She sells milk and dairy products (baked milk, \"kurt\" [traditional dried yoghurt] and \"suzmo [a type of sour cream cheese] ) on a daily basis. She also owns a land plot of 2.5 ha [6 acres], where she grows sainfoin [a plant used for animal fodder] and wheat. Tangulu's monthly income is about 10,000 KGS. In order to develop her business further, she has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to buy calves and increase her livestock. Tangulu plans to invest her revenues in a further expansion of her business.

Her home has potable water, electricity, gas, and a sewer connection.\r\n\r\nHer business is in sewing backpacks of every type and color, for children, and serious designs for adults.  She performs her work in her own workshop in her home.  \"We sew garments for the season, quilts, backpacks, clothing, anything that the area needs...\" she comments.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to expand her business and be the owner of a label.  She wishes to make an investment in her business through the purchase of fabric and sewing materials for the backpacks, such as: fabric of different colors, zippers, thread, etc.  This is the first time she has requested a loan through the institution in the four years that she has conducted this business.  It is for these reasons that Marlene is requesting a loan to buy materials to make backpacks, in order to offer the most designs and diversify her product.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1820496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials to make backpacks, in order to offer the most designs and diversify her product.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-02-22T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-24T20:00:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":477.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":514.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":491.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":528.29},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":535.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":565.71},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":573.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":618.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":640.41},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":661.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":697.73},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":695.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.36},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.91},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":145.25,"local_amount":991.97,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1003.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214317},{"amount":72.04,"local_amount":492,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:30:55Z","rounded_local_amount":497.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564437},{"amount":77.23,"local_amount":527.69,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":533.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046403},{"amount":78.46,"local_amount":535.56,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":541.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344224},{"amount":82.91,"local_amount":566.23,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":572.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554448},{"amount":83.87,"local_amount":572.71,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":579.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468577},{"amount":90.61,"local_amount":618.81,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":625.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296443},{"amount":394.63,"local_amount":2695.03,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2726.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076691}],"funded_date":"2015-03-05T23:51:05Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:03:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amanda Thur","image":null}},{"id":842992,"name":"Miraflor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Miraflor is a 29-year-old, sari-sari or retail storeowner, from Talibon, Bohol.

Samson is seeking a loan to purchase a hybrid dairy cow. For the past 10 years, Samson has been keeping traditional breed dairy cattle on his farm just like most of the farmers in the region. He has also been growing bananas and vegetables. But still, he was not making enough money to meet his needs. He was pushed to engage in other personal businesses to make a decent income. With your loan, Samson will acquire a quality dairy cow that will produce adequate litres of milk a day to enable him to generate enough income to repay the loan and save some extra money.

Meet Philemon. He is a hardworking mixed farmer based in Kapsowar, which is a small rural town in Kenya. He has a lovely family. He has been practising farming for 13 years. His primary income sources are milk, maize and vegetation produced on his farm. He also engages in personal businesses to make extra money. \r\n\r\nPhilemon is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. He enjoys taking care of animals very much. His hobby is milking early in the morning and late in the evening. He chops fodder in between during the day and fills water in troughs for the cows to drink. He regularly inspects his animals to ensure they are healthy and the milk quality is great. Philemon finds farming enjoyable, lucrative and full of growth opportunities. His biggest challenge is the poor roads leading to the market. This makes it expensive and time-consuming to ferry farm produce. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Philemon seeks to improve his family's living standard.

There, she lives with her husband, mother, and school-aged daughter and son. \r\n\r\nSadly, because she lacked economic resources and had to start working at a very young age, Tea was unable to study for a professional career. She works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing vegetables. Also, she and her husband care for 4 dairy cows and 20 sheep. They always produce high-quality products which are sold to local retailers at a good price. \r\n\r\nTea wants to start her own private business and is seeking credit from local financial institutions. The startup program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables inexperienced, rural individuals to access a loan to start or re-start businesses. \r\n\r\nTea's application was approved under this framework, granting her a loan of 3,000 USD so she can start a pharmacy. She will be able to purchase the medical supplies and equipment needed to open the pharmacy in her village. The business will be profitable, Tea believes, as it will have a great location and be the only business of its kind in the area. \r\n\r\nThis hard-working woman will be very grateful for the help from this loan, as she will get the chance to have her own business and generate additional income for her family's welfare.
