In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store that sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers.

She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. A good return on her investment will surely help fund their basic needs.\r\n\r\nErlinda hopes to maintain and grow her business so they can have a better life.

Here is his story:\r\n\r\n\u201cMy life is like a drama movie, a lot of changes in it and touching my heart events. I am 19 years old. At the age of 5 my parents were divorced. My mother decided to take care of me. Not long after, she married another man and we moved to Kuwait. I stayed with them, went to the Russian Federation Embassy\u2019s school as I didn\u2019t know the Arabic language and couldn\u2019t study at the local schools. It was hard to get accustomed to the new society, new culture, and new family.\r\n\r\nTime passed and my mother gave a birth to other three children, and my step-father built their own house. After I had finished the school and was 18 years-old, my step-father refused to take care of me anymore. My mother couldn\u2019t do anything as she had her family and other three children, so I moved back to Kyrgyzstan to my father. Several months ago my father underwent a kidney transplantation and unfortunately, now he is a disabled person. I am willing to help my father and further going to stay with him.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing for me now is getting a high education. I know that I am the only person who should act now, in order to be able to live and be happy. A good education guarantees a well-paid job, a positive image of me in the society, and enables me to support my father now, and my family in the future.   I await your support and in advance thank you for your generosity.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1819118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He is a principle farmer mainly tea farming and banana plantation. Mr. Evan has no side income to raise some other income. He has seven children aged 19, 16, 13, 9, 6, 5 and 3. The four are all school-goers but he has managed to pay school fees for them and to look after the family. \r\n\r\nIt is his eighth cycle with UGAFODE Microfinance Ltd (MDI) and he borrowed 2,000,000 UGX to buy fertilizer for his plantations. He works eight hours a day and most of his clients are tea factories in and around Bushenyi District. He started that business eight years ago and for all those years, it has been very profitable. He resorted to tea farming after getting a chunk of land from his father as his share. He hopes to buy a car for transporting his outputs of tea leaves and others and later use the money to purchase another piece of land for an extension. He finds challenges of dry weather and price fluctuations.  He thanks UGAFODE so much for the support financially.

She has a business selling condiments.  She is a good mother, independent, entrepreneurial, patient, responsible, and hardworking.  She operates her business in the area called \u201c16 de julio,\u201d characterized by its informal trade, where you can find everything from a needle to sew to a tractor to plough.  The climate is cold and dry (2\u00baC -12\u00baC), with an average elevation of 3,800 meters above sea level.\r\n\r\nRosalia is strong, has a dark complexion, long black braided hair, dark eyes, a short stature, and she dresses traditionally (sombrero, shawl, and pollera\u2014a traditional multi-layered skirt).  Her native language is Aymara, which she speaks with her family, while she speaks Spanish with the general public and for her trade.  (She is seated first on the right, dressed in black.)  She shares her life with her sons who are studying trades and working.  They live in their own house made of brick and clay, with drinkable water, electricity, gas, and plumbing.  Her desire to help her children by improving her business sales has brought her to lead a bank of people (with businesses such as juice, food, flower, sweater, and stocking sales, photocopying services, and telephone booth repairs), to request a loan and achieve her goals. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling condiments like pepper, garlic, oregano and cumin, among others.  She works during the day and until the late hours of the night in a booth near her home, commenting, \u201cI do not have any difficulties with my business, just a little competition, but many people move through the location and that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing well.\u201d  Her dream is to have a large business with sellers who run the shop.  She wishes to increase her merchandise by purchasing a greater quantity of condiments to sell at wholesale.  This is the fourth sequence of loans in seven years that she has received from this institution and she continues with her business independently.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Rosalia is requesting a loan to purchase a greater quantity of condiments to sell at wholesale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4350,"image":{"id":1820548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a greater quantity of condiments to sell at wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-02-23T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-25T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":4350,"lender_count":117,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Armando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teofila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalia Lorenza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mabel Clemencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":4350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3298.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3418.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3512.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3696.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3805.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3944},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4087.57},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4236.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":478.29},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":495.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":509.35},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":536.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":551.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":592.7},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":614.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":973.99,"local_amount":6717.19,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:30:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6728.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214320},{"amount":509.35,"local_amount":3512.8,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3518.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564440},{"amount":536.01,"local_amount":3696.63,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3702.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046406},{"amount":551.8,"local_amount":3805.49,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3811.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344227},{"amount":1778.85,"local_amount":12267.89,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":12288.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554450}],"funded_date":"2015-03-22T11:44:34Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carlie Herron","image":1714606}},{"id":844304,"name":"Mar\u00eda Juana Dolores","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juana de 39 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer muy dedicada al trabajo y los cuidados del hogar, estudi\u00f3 hasta 4to grado de educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica, est\u00e1 casada y su esposo se dedica a la siembra de ma\u00edz y maicillo y al cuido de animales, tienen 3 hijas, pero solo dos de ellas viven junto en casa, pues la mayor est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ada.\n\nJuana ha vivido toda su vida en el campo, desde que era peque\u00f1a sus padres le ense\u00f1aron que deb\u00eda trabajar duro para ganarse la vida, actualmente se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de queso fresco, elaborado con la leche obtenida de los animales que su esposo orde\u00f1a diariamente, y que venden a los vecinos.

I have 4 siblings and I am single.  I study dentistry at the Technical Catholic University of Cibao in La Vega, Dominican Republic\r\n\r\nAmong the courses I have taken there is:  Biostatistics, Anatomy 1, Epidemiology, Oral Embryology, Introduction to Psychology, Oral Microbiology, Anatomy of the head and neck, Histology, Dental Anatomy, Periodontics 1, Dental courses, Bioethics, Dental Radiology, Diagnostics and Pathology 1.

I live with my grandparents and my mother lives in another province, where she doesn't have a job or the resources to help me.  Without this loan, I will not be able to achieve my dream, accomplish my goals to be a professional and give to the world a different person full of capabilities and characteristics, intellectual as well as other characteristics that serve the same goal.  \r\n\r\nTruly, this loan would change my life in a great way.  First, because it would open a door towards self-improvement, which is something I have always admired and above all, desired.  Secondly, it would make me a better person because though this loan I could continue studying and aquaria the knowledge necessary to finish my studies and develop as a professional in the social

She did not have the opportunity to study because she was sent to work when she was little.  She is happily married and her partner makes a living in the masonry trade.  She has three older children who now have their own households; therefore, she lives just with her husband.\r\n\r\nFrom a young age, Ana worked on cotton and coffee plantations.  When she turned 25, she emigrated to the capital in search of better opportunities and was there doing domestic work.  At the age of 35, she returned to her community and got married, and it was here that she decided to start her own pig butcher business.  She also makes chicken and bean tamales that she goes from house to house selling.\r\n\r\nShe needs the requested loan to buy pigs to raise, to butcher, and to sell the meat in order to have better earnings.

She works from 5:00 am to midnight daily, and is able to make a good monthly profit. \r\n\r\nThis will be Aisha's 2nd loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loan to restock the out of stock items in her mamalishe store and started selling cooked food in the same shop.\r\n\r\nShe is doing great and has managed to pay back her loan successfully.

She currently has stocks of fabrics worth 21,000 som (KGS) and she essentially sews traditional Kyrgyz items such as comforters, mattresses and pillows.  She makes close to 10,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further develop her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 30,000 som (KGS).  This loan will be used to buy fabrics and other materials necessary for her activity.  Turdukan is planning to use the earnings from her loan to buy a sewing machine for her daughter.  She wants to transmit all her skills to her daughter and start a family business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":358.15,"image":{"id":1818261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabrics and other materials necessary for her sewing activity.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Gulcha village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-02-23T05:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-25T05:20:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.63,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Turdukan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2119},{"due_date":"2015-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2182},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2246},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2313},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2381},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2451},{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2524},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2598},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2675},{"due_date":"2015-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2754},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2836},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2921}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.85},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.07},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.9},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.32,"local_amount":2119,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2142.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624799534},{"amount":36.37,"local_amount":2182,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2206.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636161725},{"amount":37.43,"local_amount":2246,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2271.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649514122},{"amount":38.55,"local_amount":2313,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2338.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995880},{"amount":39.68,"local_amount":2381,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2407.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291302},{"amount":40.85,"local_amount":2451,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:53:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2478.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500533},{"amount":41.82,"local_amount":2524,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2552.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.25,"payment_id":711411462},{"amount":42.14,"local_amount":2598,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:59:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2626.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.16,"payment_id":730933705},{"amount":41.36,"local_amount":2675,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2704.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.22,"payment_id":752025749}],"funded_date":"2015-02-23T13:48:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":843263,"name":"Keangpham Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mork\u2019s village sources much of their drinking water from local wells, streams, and collected rainwater.

She is married and the mother of four children.  She and her husband work together: they sell fruits at a local market in town.  They work hard, under any weather conditions, because their goal is to provide their children with all the necessities of life.  Nargiz and her husband want to give their children a good education, so that in the future they can find good jobs and have better lives than their parents.

Her business is selling secondhand clothing and perfumes.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, entrepreneurial, independent, constant, responsible and hardworking. Her business is located in the '16th of July' fair, which is considered to be one of the country's largest, with a cold and dry climate that varies between 0-12 degrees Celsius during the day.\r\n\r\nSara is short, with dark skin, long black hair in a tethered horse tail style, dark eyes and a thin physique. Her native language is Aymar\u00e1, which is spoken her family, and she speaks Spanish for general use and in business. She's standing in the center wearing a green blouse with horizontal stripes.\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her children, who are in school. They live in a rented house which has potable water, electricity, gas and sewage. Her desire to give her children a better life led her to form a communal bank made of people with businesses like selling chickens, peanuts, food, sweets, children's tracksuits, kitchen utensils and books to seek loans and improve their businesses.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling secondhand clothing and perfumes. She began her business selling cosmetics and began selling secondhand clothing two years ago. She says it's a good business. \"During the rainy season, business is hard because I sell in the open, but my advantage is I have my own stall outdoors,\" she says. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own store to sell clothing. She'd like to increase the volume of her offerings through buying varieties of secondhand clothing. This is the first sequence of loans in the institution. She's been doing both businesses for eight years.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Sara is seeking a loan to buy secondhand clothing to offer better variety and give her children a better future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":1820524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy secondhand clothing to offer better variety and give her children a future.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-02-23T06:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-25T06:20:01Z","loan_amount":3200,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodora Yola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz Amanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara Julieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rossi Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa Eulalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesus Rolando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1618.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2105.71},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2144.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2183.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2217.52},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2340.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2346.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2388.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2432.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.28},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":323.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":235.44,"local_amount":1618.66,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1626.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624227114},{"amount":618.14,"local_amount":4249.76,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214318},{"amount":640.86,"local_amount":4405.87,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:30:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4427.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564438},{"amount":1004.28,"local_amount":6904.44,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:34Z","rounded_local_amount":6937.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046404},{"amount":701.28,"local_amount":4821.27,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4844.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344225}],"funded_date":"2015-02-23T13:27:26Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:39:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Alexander","image":1669027}},{"id":843279,"name":"Amos's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amos is 38 years old and has five children.

However, lack of funds is her biggest challenge. <br \/><br \/>Pamela is seeking a loan to purchase a chaff cutter. She has plans to expand her dairy farm by growing her milk production volume. A chaff cutter is going to help her achieve the objective by shredding fodder into little evenly cut pieces that the stock can quickly and easily ingest and digest. Feed in this form is also easily mixable to come up with a ration good for the stock. With your lending, Pamela's stock will grow healthy and productive. This will boost the amount of milk she takes to the market. Returns from the investment will enable her to repay the debt and afford education fees for her siblings."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":293.37,"image":{"id":1819351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a chaff cutter.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-23T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-25T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.86,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.11,"local_amount":3298.6,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3388.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265188},{"amount":31.32,"local_amount":2784.39,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2860.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601319},{"amount":34.59,"local_amount":3074.86,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3158.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459848},{"amount":33.13,"local_amount":2978.45,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3059.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.38,"payment_id":681378222},{"amount":35.49,"local_amount":3212.83,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3300.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.65,"payment_id":696587930},{"amount":40.26,"local_amount":3753.52,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3856.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.97,"payment_id":711506202},{"amount":37.77,"local_amount":3450.35,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3544.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.05,"payment_id":731023050},{"amount":38.84,"local_amount":3524.1,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3620.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.81,"payment_id":752111197}],"funded_date":"2015-02-23T18:31:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Benjamin","image":1467297}},{"id":843315,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Her name is Josephine, 51, resident of Silang, Cavite,  Philippines.

She is 37 years old and lives with her husband in the Eldoret area of Kenya. She is blessed with good looking children who are her greatest motivation in life to persevere, because she wants to provide for them a better future. \r\n\r\nNelly was unable to study to have a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past 10 years. Nelly has an affinity for farming, and it runs in her blood. \r\n\r\nBecause of how much she likes farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows, which makes her a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows, which produce between 10-15 liters a day; this helps her support her family. \r\n\r\nNelly also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements. That is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, she will be able to purchase high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. \r\n\r\nModern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore, using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. \r\n\r\nNelly is very visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production over the previous year.

Lenders! Meet Eunice, a 32-year-old farmer who has been blessed with a lovely family and lives in the village of Megun in the Eldoret area of Kenya. As a girl, she watched women in her village mobilize to start self-help groups and the memory of this collective effort led her to join Tuiyoluk self-help group. For the past five years, she has been actively involved in mixed farming. Many women in rural areas are left to run farms alone while their husbands migrate in search of paid employment. This has not been a set back because Eunice has been making great profits in farming. Eldoret is one of the places that has favorable conditions that favor horticulture farming. It has good climate, soils, a transport system, and a market. Eunice has always wanted to diversify and start horticulture farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is lack of funds to start the business off the ground. She is requesting a loan to start horticulture farming. Tuiyoluk self-help group is a group where members co-guarantee each other to secure a loan. She joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance that supports young and enterprising farmers. With your loan she intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers and potatoes. Proximity to an airport (Eldoret international Airport) will allow her transport the produce faster to an international market hence making more money. This loan will improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":216.43,"image":{"id":1819399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-23T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-25T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.34,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2162.91},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2226.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2291.18},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2358.14},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2427.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2497.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2570.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2646.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2723.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2803.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2884.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2969.29},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3056.06},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3145.35},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3237.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.53},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.46},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.41},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.39},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.8,"local_amount":5048.57,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5186.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265192},{"amount":53.44,"local_amount":4750.16,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4879.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459852},{"amount":57.84,"local_amount":5235.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5378.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.06,"payment_id":696587934},{"amount":46.01,"local_amount":4203.5,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4318.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.28,"payment_id":731023054}],"funded_date":"2015-02-23T23:34:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":843357,"name":"Tri","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Good day, lenders!

They are members of the vulnerable ethnic community of Egyptian Albanians who live in the city of Korca. Ardian is 42 years old and has a 10-year-old child with Anjeza.  He collects scrap metal to earn a living. This is one of the most favorite activities amongst members of their community; they do very well in it. Usually they travel around with a motorcycle, locally called a \"dumdum,\" and call out to ask whether households have old scraps at home that they could sell.

Her husband, like many other men in the villages, works in a foreign country. Salomat has a little son, one and a half years old. She thinks her son is the most precious gift from the Lord and she is ready to do anything for him. While her husband is abroad, Salomat and her son live alone. She both raises livestock and plants crops. It is now time to plant new crops and she is actively preparing for the upcoming event.

When asked about her future plans, Elizabeth said that she has a long term plan of becoming a reliable chicken supplier for large supermarkets and restaurants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1819482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to expand her chicken run to get economies of scale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-02-23T22:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-25T22:20:07Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Glenis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patience","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636477658},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649745772},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665235533},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681541926},{"amount":333.68,"local_amount":333.68,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":333.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696747184},{"amount":333,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":333,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711678866}],"funded_date":"2015-02-24T17:41:26Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T19:00:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":843440,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The person in the photograph is Irene.

He works for ten hours a day and has another source of income which is boda boda or a motorcycle taxi business. He started the coffee trade in 1999 and the reason was to sustain his family and earn an income as a man. \r\n\r\nThis is Karori's fourth cycle and he is borrowing UGX 1,000,000 to buy more coffee to sell through his business as these months are the coffee season. All categories of people both local and urban are his clients since he buys from the local population and sells the coffee to factories in and around Ishaka and Bushenyi.

the famous Rift valley escarpment. Susan, 35, has been farming for the past 10 years. Through these years, she has gained much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. \r\n,\r\nShe has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops, and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Susan is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. \r\n\r\nThat is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereal. Kenya's Eldoret area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereal. This means that Susan could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Susan, but she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Susan believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereal. \r\n\r\nShe also believes that the extra income she earns will enable a permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Susan to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475.38,"image":{"id":1819520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural

With her current loan from Thrive, Kudzanayi is looking forward to ordering more boxes of health and beauty products to grow her profit levels."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1812698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To expand her range of health goods for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-02-23T23:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-25T23:00:27Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Auntie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jollyjoy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kudzanai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636477661},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:53:22Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649745775},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665235535},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681541929},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696747187},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711678868}],"funded_date":"2015-02-25T04:09:42Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T19:00:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":843494,"name":"La Buena Nueva 1, 3 & 5 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janira is one of the members in her group, La Buena Nueva (Good New) 1, 3 & 5, located in the city of Samana, in one of the rural areas surrounded by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean.

The atelier is located far away from her house, making it difficult for Zarrina to commute from home to work and back. She decided to purchase a car to ease her commute. Zarrina has been wanting to have a car for a long time and upon learning that Humo supports women clients and can help her, she requested a loan.

He would like to invest in a bulk purchase of raw materials, including paint, clay and brushes.<br \/><br \/>Jose has been selling through NOVICA since 2010. This is his story:<br \/><br \/>\"My favorite thing to do is to create new designs and I love the challenge of crafting and painting them by hand,\" says Guatemala's Jose. \"Each design is proof of the richness of our culture. Working with ceramics has brought me many beautiful things, from learning the craft from my mother and uncles, to providing for my family so that my four children can go to the university. I already have a grandchild and my wish for all of them is that they become independent people with a career of their choice. That they be responsible and be respectful of God.\"<br \/><br \/>\"This microcredit will help with upkeep of my workshop and allow me to acquire the raw materials that I need. Paint, in particular, represents a heavy cost for me, and being able to purchase in bulk will be greatly advantageous.
