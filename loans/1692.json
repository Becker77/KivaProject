Mirabbos is only 25 years old, but already married and a father. He is a responsible man, but he did not get the opportunity to attend university.  He chose to become involved in animal husbandry because his parents were raising livestock and they showed him how to take care of farm animals and how to run a farming business.  Mirabbos has a stable stocked with cattle feed.  He is taking a loan to buy livestock and to start his own business.  He wants to buy some animals, fatten them for a few months, and then resell them.  In the future, he wants to increase the size of his herd and improve the living conditions of his family.  He is looking forward to your support.  Thanks to your help, he will be able to purchase livestock and make a living.

His family doesn\u2019t have a house in our city and they are too poor to rent one for him. Even though it\u2019s hard to meet ends for my family, we are able to help him as he is our relative. After he gets a degree, he will leave our house.\r\n\r\nI am ambitious and willing to study to conquer the peaks of knowledge.

He studied up to tenth grade, but couldn't finish his studies because of family and financial reasons. His mother died when he was attending high school, and he felt too discouraged to continue with his studies. He is in a relationship, and his common-law wife is currently abroad. They have two children.\r\n\r\nEdwin makes a living in construction. He works as a mason, an occupation that he learned when he was a mason's assistant and that he has been following since he was 12 years old. The low income that their parents used to earn forced him to learn to work from a very young age. He doesn't follow any other occupations. The distance he travels varies according to where his work is required. He travels on foot or by bicycle, and he works from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to buy a motorcycle because he wastes too much time commuting, and, on many occasions, where he goes there is no public transportation available. This is why he badly needs his own means of transportation.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to keep on working and getting ahead so that he can provide his children with an education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1820986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to

She is a 39-year-old mother who lives with her family in the Kericho area of Kenya, and is blessed with a lovely family which is her greatest motivation in life to persevere because she wants to provide them a better future. Grace was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and has been practicing farming for the past 10 years. She is an early riser who goes to her farm to earn a living, and has space there to use for dairy farming. She has requested a loan to buy a dairy cow. Kericho is an area that has a high population and there is a high demand for milk. Grace, being an enterprising person, wants to take full advantage of that need and earn extra income. She hopes that this loan will allow her to change her standard of living and expand her milk-selling business.Once she has accumulated more profits, she plans to open a very large milk-selling business in the nearby shopping center and package milk. She wants to be economically empowered and knows that accessing funds is challenging, but with partners such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, she feels relieved to know that all her dreams will be achieved and she will be able to provide a secure future for her children and improve her family's living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":527.67,"image":{"id":1820161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy another dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-24T21:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-26T21:20:04Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.66,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":122000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5246.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5400.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5558.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5720.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5887.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6059.85},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6236.95},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6419.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6606.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6799.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6998.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":7203.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":7413.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":7630.35},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":7853.35},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":8082.86},{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":8319.08},{"due_date":"2016-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":8562.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.02},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.03},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.24},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.44},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.71},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.04},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.43},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.9},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.44},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.06},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.35,"local_amount":6086.49,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6150.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265199},{"amount":117.09,"local_amount":10581.27,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":10691.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459857},{"amount":230.32,"local_amount":21198,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":21419.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.25,"payment_id":696587941},{"amount":26.61,"local_amount":2471.79,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2497.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.74,"payment_id":731023061},{"amount":79.64,"local_amount":7347.6,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:26Z","rounded_local_amount":7424.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.67,"payment_id":752111206}],"funded_date":"2015-03-02T00:22:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":843992,"name":"Annie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annie is 50 years old, married and has three children.

She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have a better time milking her cow and also feeding. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also protects them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain.\r\n\r\nJudith believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production.

She owns a 1-acre farm on which they keep cows, poultry, and grow maize. Priscilla also runs a small business supplying cereals to consumers. Priscilla is seeking a loan to restock her cereal store. \r\n\r\nShe is going to sell the cereal seeds in a better market, at a higher price than she paid for them; the greater her supply, the greater her profit.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Janet\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of five and three quarters acres of land, and purchase a total of six solar lights.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1804565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-02-24T22:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-26T22:40:10Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fransisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rofina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":76080,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76080}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-22T19:45:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maureen Wharton","image":null}},{"id":844026,"name":"Genoveva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Genoveva is 47 years old, married, and has four children who are studying.

With the profits that she gains from this year\u2019s harvest, she plans to rent more land to cultivate.\r\n\r\nElizabeth and her group will receive a total of eight solar lights as well as input loans of maize and fertilizer to plant a total of 6.5 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1804570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-02-24T23:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-26T23:00:04Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Titus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kennedy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":98160,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98160}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-21T23:48:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":844569,"name":"Julian Gregorio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juli\u00e1n es un joven de 25 a\u00f1os de edad que con su venta de productos de uso y consumo personal sostiene sus estudios, es muy responsable y comprometido es tanto el empe\u00f1o que pone en sus actividades que para vender realiza largos desplazamientos pero eso no importa con tal de generar recursos para transportarse a su universidad, pagar sus libros, copias, su matr\u00edcula, su alimento, esto lo tiene muy feliz y quiere seguir con este proyecto aspira a tener un local, una persona vendiendo y que juntos salgan adelante.\nCon la ayuda de un pr\u00e9stamo Juli\u00e1n quiere capitalizar su negocio, cubrir algunas perdidas, y seguir con su labor, comprando art\u00edculos de cuidado capilar, facial, para el cuerpo y el hogar.\n","en":"Juli\u00e1n, age 25, keeps up his studies with his sale of personal use and consumption products.

Velima also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Velima's Group will be able to receive a total of 14 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 11.25 acres.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1804575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-02-24T23:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-26T23:00:05Z","loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Velima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Centrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milicent","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mourice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Philis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonfence","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jentrix","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Praxidis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linnet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Floence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":169730,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169730}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-23T15:28:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maureen Wharton","image":null}},{"id":843523,"name":"030306040001.thi\u1ec7u L\u00fd Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Thanh is 64 years old and she is married with three children.

Meet Lilian. She is a 37-year-old, smallholder farmer based in Nyamira, which is a small rural town in the Nyanza region of Kenya. Lilian and her husband have been blessed with three children. For sixteen years, Lilian has been a mixed farmer. She keeps dairy cattle and poultry on her farm. She also grows maize, among other crops. \r\n\r\nDespite prevailing animal diseases, she finds dairy farming to be the most enjoyable commercial farming activity. Besides dairy farming, she has a deep connection with gardening. In African communities, gardening is the most popular, and the least exclusive, hobby for women. You really don't have to be born with a green thumb to give life to a glorious garden; any woman with a homestead and a few square feet of earth can do her best to make her little corner of the world more gracious and beautiful. \r\n\r\nLilian, however, is taking this a little step further.

lives in a rural village in the Soni Kom district of Siem Reap province. She is 49 years old, a wife and mother of nine. Two of  her children are still her dependents. Her main source of income is from rice farming. Her children are also helping out with the family budget as paid workers in Thailand.

Asmati decided to start her own, more stable activity and requested a loan as she has no financial support. \r\nHer loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. Asmati has requested a Credo loan for the start-up her own business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Asmati plans to renovate the place for ritual hall and generate income from this activity. Her business will be used by local people for wedding days, christenings and other celebrations.

He needs to make repairs to his taxi because its current condition is poor and requires additional maintenance on a daily basis.  Due to insufficient financial means he is unable to make the necessary repairs to his taxi.  Therefore Zahida Kausar has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan Zahida Kausar's husband can afford the maintenance cost easily and provide better transportation services to earn a profitable income.  She also plans to save some of the profit from her husband's income to meet their family's needs in future.
