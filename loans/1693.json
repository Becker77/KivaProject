Bakary gets his supplies from the weekly livestock market in his area. He raises rams and ewes until they are fully grown, then he calls on his customers who come and buy directly from him. Over the course of this period, he could bring in profits between 17,500-150,000 FCFA per quarter. He has been doing this work for 16 years.

In this community, five CBO (community based organization) members oversee a group of 23 village customers (20 male and 3 female). This loan will help some group members purchase ducks that will boost the community's income from more duck eggs. The remaining group members will use the funds to purchase high-quality feeds such as duck food and packets of shrimp (costing $25 a week for 100 ducks).\r\n \r\nAh Hpaung Gyi village has a population of over five hundred, many of whom focus on farming. The village relies on duck raising for income and pigs for savings. Besides livestock raising, some households also annually plant fruits such as bananas and coconuts, and centrally located villagers have small grocery shops in front of their houses.\r\n\r\nPictured above are the CBO members from Ah Hpaung Gyi Village Group named, Zaw, Hla, Win, Htay and Htun.  Zaw, second from right in the picture, is 45 years old and married with one son, who is a secondary student. Zaw farms his two-acre crop farm and looks after his ducks. For additional income, his wife has a opened dry food store, and she also takes care of household affairs. \r\n\r\nWith Proximity's loan, Zaw will purchase high-quality feeds that will boost his small family's income from nourished duck eggs. Part of the proceeds will help Zaw's family fund his son's increasingly expensive education.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1816351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones","Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase more ducks and high-quality feeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MM","country":"Myanmar (Burma)","town":"Dedaye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22 98","type":"point"}},"partner_id":416,"posted_date":"2015-02-25T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-27T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":4475,"lender_count":165,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ah Hpaung Gyi Village Group","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MMK","disbursal_amount":4600000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":4475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-24T03:03:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":844219,"name":"Sevgi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sevgi lives with her two children.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to buy a cow.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Joshua\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 6.25 acres of land and purchase a total of 14 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1806130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-02-25T14:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-27T14:20:04Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Truphena","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samueli","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nolela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gerishom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brigit","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":126820,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126820}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-24T09:11:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":844231,"name":"Marte","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the photograph are Marte and her husband, Ndoc, for whom she is requesting this loan.

The profits from the business will be used to buy cattle.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

The oldest child, who is 10 years old, is enrolled in school and the youngest one is 3 years old. Ali is employed as a soldier in the army with a very small salary. In truth, that salary is not enough to cover the necessary expenses of his family. It is very difficult for him to meet the demands of his family, especially since his children still are very small and neither of them works. Ali strives strongly to provide his family with a suitable living condition, but he found himself incapable due to his very limited income and the hard situation in the country these days. <br \/><br \/>Ali couldn't afford this situation and decided to find an income source for him and his family. He believes the best thing he can do is to purchase a taxi for him to work as a driver. This taxi will cover some of the necessary expenses of the family. The only problem that Ali faces is the capital and the financial support to buy the taxi. He heard of AMB, the Kiva partner in Yemen, which gives loans to anyone who wants to start or improve a business, especially poor people and people who have a limited income. So he applied for it and asked for a loan of 1,200,000 YER from Al-Amal Microfinance Bank to purchase a taxi. <br \/><br \/>Ali looks forward to expanding his house more by building another

was born in a farming family. He is 48 years old. He is married and has four children. Almurat lives with his family in the countryside. He does not have higher education, as it was not possible for him to study at the university due to his family's financial problems. Almurat's wife does not have an education either, and she is a housewife. She does housework and raises the children. \r\n\r\nIn order to have an income for food, Almurat has his own business. He works with fattening and reselling cattle. He gets a good income from this business. Almurat's wife also helps him with the business.

He is 46 years old. He is married, but does not have children. He has a very tight family. They live in the countryside. Abdumanon's main and most stable business is livestock breeding. He breeds and sells livestock. His wife helps him with this business. He looks after the livestock, and also sells the milk he gets from them.\r\n\r\nThe livestock breeding business brings Abdumanon a good and stable income. Therefore he would like to expand it.

man of 25. He is married and has three children. He is a very cheerful person and a loving father. He lives in a house he built himself. To earn a living, he runs his own business as a taxi driver. He has his own car for this, but he has had it for a long time and he has had to repair it many times. Therefore he is now planning to buy a new, better car to operate and expand his business with. This business brings in a good income, but only enough to cover his living expenses.\r\n\r\nIn order to buy a new car, Sherzod needs money.

She shares her life with her partner, who is dedicated to transportation, and with her children, who are studying in school. \r\n\r\nThey live in their own house, which is built of brick with a corrugated iron roof; their house also has electricity and well water. Ten years ago, she acquired a lot of land, where she began building her house, which has 2 rooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, and a washing room. The house doesn\u2019t have drinking water because the houses in the area are old and don\u2019t use the service. She says that she spent 10 years building her house, and she wants to give her family the comfort of having running water. Her dream is to finish building her house. She wants to install running water in her kitchen, bathroom, and washing room to give her family a comfortable life. This is her first sequence of loan with the institution in the 10 years she has been building her house.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Mercy requests a loan to install running water in her kitchen, bathroom, and washing room so that her children may live in better conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1821925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to install running water in her kitchen, bathroom, and washing room so that she children may live in better conditions.

This group consists of Hanan, Hesa, Jawhra and Amina. They fully repaid the first loan and have applied for another loan of 200,000 YER from Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n Amina is the leader of the group. She is married and the mother of four children who live with them in their own house. Her husband is an immigrant who works outside of the country and the money he sends for her and her children is a very small amount. So, Amina decided to sell ice cream in the streets to meet her children\u2019s needs. She found that this business is not profitable for her and decided to seek another profitable business, selling clothing, incense, and perfumes to women door-to-door.

With the loan, he will be able to earn an associate\u2019s degree successfully. After graduation, he is going to find a job in another hospital with a decent salary, so he will be able to save money to build a proper house and also send his child to school.

She hopes to make a good investment. \r\n\r\nShe gives her thanks to Kiva. The rest of the group members are engaged in weaving, embroidery, and poultry.

of the group Chunnu.\u2019 She belongs to one of the tribal groups in Manipur. She lives with her husband and three children in \u2018Longa K\u2019 village which lies in the hills. In her village,  people engage in manual farming for their livelihood and Donyang\u2019s family is one among them. Her husband is a farmer who provides his family from his farming. \r\n\r\nDonyang is a gifted and talented weaver. She uses her skills to support her family by weaving traditional shawls (local name \u2018Saipikhup\u2019 and \u2018Thangnang\u2019) and wraparound skirts (local name \u2018Khamtang\u2019) for sale. In Manipur, wraparound skirts are commonly worn by womenfolk at all times and shawls are worn during winter by both men and women to beat the cold. She has been in weaving business for the past 20 years. She sells her weaving product at home and most customers come to her house to buy the products. It takes at least two weeks to complete one wraparound skirt and one week for a shawl.\r\n\r\n Donyang has previously received a loan  from Kiva and WSDS. It helped her improve her financial condition. She is very glad that she is now able to support herself and her children, but still strives to give them  the best she can. \r\n \r\nShe wishes to buy a stock of silk yarn and threads for her weaving. With the loan she will buy varieties of colourful silk yarn to make beautiful shawls and wraparound skirts to attract customers. The income will provide for her children\u2019s education cost and other basic needs. She thanks WSDS for their support and the rest of the group members are very happy and excited to get a loan. They are engaged in weaving, poultry, piggery, shopkeeper, clothing sales, and selling rice. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1820910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy colourful silk yarn to use in weaving skirts to sell and pay for the basic needs of her family.

is a 36-year-old, married man and a father of four children, who lives with his family in a rented house in Sana'a city, Yemen. Farouk has struggled, and is a man who works hard to guarantee a better future for his family. He started working as a worker in a traditional restaurant with a small salary. He found the work with other as a difficulty for him and decided to start his own business. In time, he opened a small and traditional restaurant for himself, and he had employed a small number of workers in it with a monthly salary. \r\n\r\nIn truth, his capital is still very low and that negatively affects his income. For this reason, he applied to Al- Amal Microfinance Bank and asked for a loan of 200,000 YER to purchase many different food materials for his restaurant. Farouk hopes to buy a piece of land and build his own house on it. He also hopes to open another restaurant besides the first

lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Kenya remain underserved by financial institutions. Juhudi Kilimo is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Kenyan farmers. <br \/><br \/>Meet Cherono, an ambitious woman who always seeks her horizon. Since she was little, she showed a strong passion for independent work, but when she became pregnant, she left behind many of her dreams to focus completely on taking care of her little ones.<br \/><br \/>Since her children are at a good age, she wants to take up her dreams again and create work to maintain herself, since she doesn't know when her husband might be lacking or when they would go through a very complicated situation. Her primary source of income has come from selling milk, crop farming, and poultry farming. Through these ventures, she has been able to earn a decent income. She is a very determined and dedicated farmer who has been farming for ten years, and throughout she has never regretted going into farming. <br \/><br \/>Although this humble mum has been making profits, not everything has been \u201ca bed of roses.\" She faces financial challenges, and because the Kericho area has proven a ready market for cereals, she is kindly seeking a loan to buy cereals for resale and thus improve her income. <br \/><br \/>Cherono's upbringing was challenging, and she has faced many economic problems. Still, this ever-smiling mum has been making great improvements, and she believes that through your loan she will be able to realize her goal of improving her living conditions and transforming her life. <br \/><br \/>Through Juhudi Kilimo, Cherono has received training and proven to be honest and disciplined with finances. She intends to fully repay the loan with the profits from her business. Cherono is quite a visionary and, with her accumulated profits, she hopes she will be able to open a large cereal-selling shop that will boost her income and turn her life around."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":343.26,"image":{"id":1821505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural

Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going

He also leases 0.2 hectare of land and is involved in crop farming, sowing wheat at the beginning of every season.  He has already devoted 20 years of his life to this activity.  Zulfikuor is hardworking and works tirelessly in order to provide for his family.  At the moment, he wants to start a new business and get involved in animal husbandry.  He already has a barn and some feed for his livestock, but he doesn't have any farm animals yet.  For this reason, he is taking a loan to buy some cattle.  Thanks to your support, Zulfikuor will be able to start a new business and increase his income to support his family.  Please help Zulfikuor.

She is a single mother with two children, ages 19 and 17.  Having come from a humble background she was unable to get an education.

marriage with Jes\u00fas. They live together, as love united them several years ago. Now they have a beautiful family with two children. The oldest already has his own family, and the youngest, who is 13, is in secondary education. Her spouse, Don Jes\u00fas, works as a freight driver to transport people and merchandise among other things. He works for the owner of the vehicle as his economic condition has not allowed him to acquire his own means of work.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda works selling cosmetics occasionally, but for a while now her forte has been preparing roast meats to sell. She does this in her home in a small oven that she acquired with her savings that she used to set up her small business. For six years now she and her family have lived in Barrio la Castellana, located in Santo Domingo. This area is well traversed and this is why her business has grown in this short time.\r\n\r\nThe loan Mar\u00eda is asking for will be used to buy a refrigerator and to repair the floor of her business, in order to offer a better service to her customers. She knew about the Foundation as she took out a similar loan several years ago in order to carry out another project. For some time she has wanted to get this project going, but she was not able to due to a lack of capital, and due to her husband falling ill, they had no income. They spent some time with various necessities but Mar\u00eda did occasional work and was able to support her family during this difficult period. Today, Mar\u00eda is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and Kiva for helping her big dream of improvement to come true."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":651.94,"image":{"id":1482162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a refrigerator and repair her floor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2015-02-26T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-28T12:20:01Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1003.84,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":75.18},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":78.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":79.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":81.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":84.31},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":88.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":89.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":90.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":93.57},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":95.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.89},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.54},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.53,"local_amount":66.14,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:40:45Z","rounded_local_amount":67.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636217592},{"amount":74.63,"local_amount":73.09,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":74.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649568082},{"amount":80.42,"local_amount":78.76,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T12:43:27Z","rounded_local_amount":80.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665436783},{"amount":81.5,"local_amount":79.82,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":81.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347849},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":81.63,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":83.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696558245},{"amount":85.76,"local_amount":83.99,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:42:08Z","rounded_local_amount":85.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711473183},{"amount":88.1,"local_amount":86.28,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:20:24Z","rounded_local_amount":88.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730992218},{"amount":90.65,"local_amount":88.78,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":90.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752080516}],"funded_date":"2015-03-17T19:53:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Brown","image":1233582}},{"id":845210,"name":"D\u00fao Luz En Mi Camino Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"D\u00fao Luz en Mi Camino La encargada de este grupo es la se\u00f1ora Estefana quien tiene m\u00e1s de 25 a\u00f1os de tener su negocio en la calle principal de su colonia.

consists of five CBO (Community Based Organization) members overseeing a group of 20 village customers. The loan will help to group members to purchase high-quality feeds costing $200 that last for a month for 100 ducks. Raising ducks has become one of the main income sources in this village.\r\n\r\nHmaw Ei village is estimated of having over 400 households, and many of them focus on livestock and farming. While ducks are the most popular livestock, families also raise chickens for income and pigs as a source of savings. Some families plant seasonal or yearly fruits and vegetables such as betel, coconuts and bananas. These vegetables are sold to nearby markets or villages. Additionally, centrally located households have opened small sweet shops in front of their houses. \r\n\r\nPictured above are the CBO members from Hmaw Ei group-1 named Zin, Than, Sa and Aye. The picture was taken in front of a small snack shop of the secondary school in the village.  \r\n\r\nZin, first from right in the picture, is 26 years old and married with one child who is a primary student. The couple have been raising ducks for over two years. They now have 120 ducks.

She has a secondary education and is retired. She has been raising livestock and planting crops for many years. Thanks to Bakbu's hard work, she currently has 30 sheep and plants beans to sell on a 1.16 hectare plot of land, earning around 8,000 som (KGS) per month. This amount of money is nowhere near enough to live decently. She applied for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS) with Bai-Tushum Bank in order to expand her business and increase her profits by buying 20 sheep.
