Meet Salina, a 55-year-old youthful, very hardworking, honest, and ever-smiling mother. She lives with her husband in a remote village in Kapsowar, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. \r\n\r\nSalina passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past five years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding the large family she has requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her large family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. \r\n\r\nSalina has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and the price of milk in the recent past has been going up, so Salina, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learned that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nSalina said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agriculture-based loans and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo and from the training, she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro-finance institutions. Salina hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children. She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":352.19,"image":{"id":1821737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-26T17:20:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-28T17:20:23Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.23,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":63100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4465.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4596.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4730.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4868.86},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5011.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5157.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5308.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5463.47},{"due_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5623.14},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5787.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5956.62},{"due_date":"2016-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":6130.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.89},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.61},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.2},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.08},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":107.67,"local_amount":9705.71,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":9835,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459871},{"amount":95.45,"local_amount":8760.13,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":8876.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.73,"payment_id":696587955},{"amount":55.28,"local_amount":5226.01,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5295.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.69,"payment_id":711506220},{"amount":87.56,"local_amount":8055.97,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":8163.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.81,"payment_id":752111218}],"funded_date":"2015-03-13T22:50:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":844981,"name":"Cavidan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cavidan is 62 and the mother of three children.

The majority of inhabitants make a living by fishing for and selling sea bream. Some others grow sugarcane, corn, lemons and rubber.

She is known in her community as \"Do\u00f1a Cuco\" although her siblings also call her \"Cuquita\". At the age of 26, with two children, she decided to work in the family business and start selling the sea bream which her father and siblings caught. As the years went by, her number of clients increased, but so did the number of fishermen with experience in her community. \r\n\r\nForty years after she started to work in this business, Do\u00f1a Cuco goes out on the streets three times per week with two tanks of sea bream in 1-kilo packs. Thankfully, two of her children also have experience with this business activity and are in charge of the sea bream cooperative: they buy sea bream from other fishermen and resell it by kilo or by the piece, depending on the client.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Cuco needs a new loan to buy more sea bream. \"I have invested each one of the loans I have received over the past seven years in the purchase of fish, nets, and maintaining my boat.\" Cuco is very grateful for this loan because she wishes to keep her business alive and even grow despite the competition.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, her earnings have allowed her to start selling mole sauce, a business which she also hopes to grow now that her children spend more time on the sea bream business.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken on Do\u00f1a Cuco's back porch, which offers a pleasant view of the lagoon. She is wearing a blue shirt and black skirt."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3725,"image":{"id":1820797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy sea bream.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Cerro Mojarra la Capilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-02-26T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-28T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":3725,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Refugio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulogia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Demetria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465.63},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465.62},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465.62},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465.62},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1396.87,"local_amount":21000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":21034.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769252},{"amount":931.25,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:19:29Z","rounded_local_amount":14023.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649764010},{"amount":931.26,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":14023.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597535},{"amount":465.62,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:40Z","rounded_local_amount":7011.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682140926}],"funded_date":"2015-02-26T20:21:01Z","paid_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":845245,"name":"Pedro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pedro tiene 58 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en casa propia de material r\u00fastico con su c\u00f3nyuge y su hijo en el distrito de Pomahuca, provincia de Ja\u00e9n, regi\u00f3n de Cajamarca, en la sierra norte de Per\u00fa.

To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling sheep meat, wool, eggs, and a variety of crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and to earn extra cash, Monicah has been engaged in another small personal business. The Kapsowar area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the really high demand. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming so she is seeking a loan of 10,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, Monicah feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved and she will be able to buy more poultry. As a result of the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market. This will translate into an increased profit margin and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, Monicah intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry sales to other markets to increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income will be used to fully repay the loan, change her living conditions, and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":79.86,"image":{"id":1821860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To pay for poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-26T19:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-28T19:00:13Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.99,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monicah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":707.73},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":728.41},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":749.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":771.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":794.16},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":817.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":841.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":865.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":891.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":917.19},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":944},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":971.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.64},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.52},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.82},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.14},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10.8,"local_amount":863.62,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:44Z","rounded_local_amount":986.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265212},{"amount":9.38,"local_amount":750.79,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:46Z","rounded_local_amount":857.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601340},{"amount":8.31,"local_amount":665.07,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":759.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459874},{"amount":10.5,"local_amount":849.58,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":970.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.12,"payment_id":681378243},{"amount":9.39,"local_amount":765.73,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":874.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.18,"payment_id":696587957},{"amount":8.26,"local_amount":678.83,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":775.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.23,"payment_id":731023078},{"amount":22.23,"local_amount":1814.99,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2072.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.46,"payment_id":752111221}],"funded_date":"2015-02-26T20:23:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":845251,"name":"Juana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Juana se dedica al cultivo de caf\u00e9 tiene m\u00e1s de quince a\u00f1os de trabajar en este oficio.

She is requesting a loan of 20,000 KES, which she will use to buy additional poultry.\r\n\r\nWith your loan, Christine will be able to expand the poultry section on her farm. This will generate enough income to repay the loan, and she will also be able to save extra money. Christine is very concerned about her children\u2019s education, so profits from farming will go to pay their school fees. Christine dreams of a secure future for her children. She awaits your kindness.

Homa Bay County is located in southwestern Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and irregular rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits.\r\n\r\nDavid is married and has five children. Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for ten years, and they are currently growing maize, butter nuts, mangoes and citrus fruits. David is excited about beekeeping, as it will earn him some income from the sale of honey and provide him with honey for food.\r\n\r\nThis is David's first loan from Honey Care, and he plans to use the proceeds from his beehives to pay school fees for his children and to provide for his family's basic needs.

A market day in a lakeside town in Homa Bay County often boasts traders from Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, all of whom arrive in boats to sell their wares. Although the semi-arid nature of much of Homa Bay County means that poverty rates are quite high, many people in the region are influenced by a strong cultural emphasis on education, and as a result school attendance figures around Homa Bay are above the national average.\r\n\r\nRichard is married and has two children. Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for ten years, and they are currently growing maize, millet and beans and they also keep livestock. Richard is excited about beekeeping, as it will earn him some income from the sale of honey and provide him with honey for medicine.\r\n\r\nThis is Richard's first loan from Honey Care, and he plans to use the proceeds from his beehives to pay school fees for his children. Richard's hope for the future is to start a CBO for beekeeping and to have a healthy family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1784872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Homa Bay","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2015-02-26T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-28T19:20:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Richard\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":17100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":17100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-02-27T08:10:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tony Gooch","image":970369}},{"id":844705,"name":"Angel Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo solidario est\u00e1 integrado por tres mujeres (Fidelia, Bernicia y Waleska Vanessa) de la etnia miskita de Bilwi, municipio de Puerto Cabezas.

The local economy largely depends on this crop and during the harvest season, when the plantations are trimmed down, many communities become exposed. The members of this group chose the name El Esfuerzo (Spanish for effort), referring to the daily effort each one of them makes in order to improve their families' quality of life.\r\n\r\nThey all work selling various products, such as chicken (Roberto, Isabel, and Mar\u00eda Magdalena); snacks (Paula and Ana); clothing and cosmetics (Mar\u00eda Del Carmen); pineapple, hamburgers, and hot dogs (Rosalba); sweets (Mar\u00eda); merchandise (Patricia); and pineapple and juice (Elodia).\r\n\r\nEveryone knows Roberto as Beto. For the past three years now, he has been working as a street vendor selling chicken. He covers the streets of several nearby communities and also travels to others further away. His goals are to meet his customers' needs and to give his family better opportunities than he had growing up. Beto gets up every day at 4:00 am to start preparing all the meat and everything he needs for the day.\r\n\r\nBeto was able to purchase a motorcycle with his earnings and profit. He is still helping his son with his studies and also invests in his business. Aside from chicken, he also buys soft drinks and fried products in order to make some extra income. In order to continue working, Beto needs to buy sixty chickens, feed, and plastic bags, so he has requested a loan from VisionFund Mexico. \r\n\r\nIn the short run, Beto would like to start selling roast chickens, rice, and salsa on the weekends. He has already planned this out, and the new business will benefit the people in his community who currently have to travel long distances in order to buy chicken. Regarding his personal life and his achievements, Beto says \"I'm a single dad and I have provided for my two kids thanks to my effort and work. I'm grateful to each one of the people who make loans possible.\"\r\n\r\nRoberto is the only man in the group. The picture was taken outside his house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1820810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens, feed, and plastic bags.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acatlan de Perez, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-02-26T19:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-28T19:40:04Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Catalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elodia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Lilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":157.82,"local_amount":2375,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2376.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423916},{"amount":631.27,"local_amount":9500,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":9505.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769253},{"amount":789.06,"local_amount":11875,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":11882.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649764011},{"amount":467.26,"local_amount":7032,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":7036.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597536},{"amount":479.59,"local_amount":7218,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":7222.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682140927}],"funded_date":"2015-02-26T20:33:24Z","paid_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":845028,"name":"Fe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fe is married and she works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by farming sugarcane in the Philippines, and also earns income from raising livestock and selling rice grains.

That organization includes mostly agronomists and agricultural technicians and their main activity is the preparation and marketing of various seedlings. Benito's organization has participated in projects with various institutions and individuals working in the agricultural sector.The committee board is composed as follows: Benito as coordinator, Henry as his Assistant, Fleurise as secretary, Ren\u00e9 as head of Project and Dejoie as Advisor.\n\nAs part of the Project of USAID\/AVANSE, his organization was selected to provide seedlings to Northern farmers. Throughout this partnership, his organization will create two new part-time jobs. To do this, a loan is essential for the organization. That's why this organization turned to Zaf\u00e8n. Trough a partnership with Zafen, PADF has already supported this project up to 25%.

Meet Mary, a very hardworking, energetic young farmer. Although she has only farmed for the past ten years, she is working hard and learning good farming practices. Through the profits she makes, she has been able to take care of her family and provide the basic needs for her parents. \r\n\r\nMary lives near Kasubwa in the Kapsowar area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming. Maize is a very common crop in Kenya and is a staple food for many who regularly eat \u201cugali,\u201c or hard porridge cooked from maize. One can usually buy sifted maize flour in the market, but its cost is higher because of the processing. Flour can be less expensive, however, if it is milled directly using a posho mill. \r\n\r\nThe Kasubwa area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a great number of people. The main problem here is that the posho mill keeps breaking down so farmers cannot grind their maize. Mary intends to change this by buying another posho mill to serve the area. She will buy an electric, rather than diesel, posho mill, as they are more reliable. Hopefully breakdowns will be few and far between. \r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, Mary is applying for a 130,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy a mill. Profits derived from the mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan. In the next two years, Mary sees herself established and running more than one posho mill. She patiently waits for your kindness. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":392.31,"image":{"id":1821876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy an electric posho (cornmeal) mill","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-26T20:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-28T20:00:05Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.57,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":28,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3812.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3924.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4039.09},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4157.14},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4278.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4403.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4532.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4664.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4801.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4941.47},{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5085.89},{"due_date":"2016-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5234.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5387.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5544.95},{"due_date":"2016-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5707.05},{"due_date":"2016-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5873.79},{"due_date":"2016-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":6045.45},{"due_date":"2016-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":6222.13},{"due_date":"2016-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":6403.97},{"due_date":"2016-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":6591.13},{"due_date":"2017-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":6783.75},{"due_date":"2017-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":6982.01},{"due_date":"2017-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7186.06},{"due_date":"2017-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7396.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.68},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.13},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.63},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.75},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.38},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.05},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.78},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.56},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.39},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.27},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.2},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.2},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.25},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.36},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.53},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.77},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.52,"local_amount":6524.22,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":6532.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459875},{"amount":125.06,"local_amount":11536.69,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":11551.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.4,"payment_id":681378244},{"amount":189.16,"local_amount":17728.41,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":17750.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.17,"payment_id":731023079}],"funded_date":"2015-03-02T17:45:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":845029,"name":"Hanady","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanady is a 22-year-old single lady living with her family in Ajloun.

Most of them are Mayan and speak both Kaqchiquel and Spanish, and they wear the traditional dress of their village. They range in age from 37 years to 63 years. One woman is illiterate and the others have 2-4 years of primary school education.  Among the business represented are, a small store, sales of fruits and vegetables, and sales of sewing materials. They are looking forward to working with Namaste because they feel they need the business and money management classes that Namaste provides.  Each woman has a dream and with the help of the classes and a Namaste Business Advisor they will be able to grow their business and achieve their dream.\nOne hard-working member of this group, Do\u00f1a Vilma, is a very entrepreneurial woman, and with the help of her husband has opened a small store in the local market. Three times a week she also goes to the big market in Guatemala City where she sells vegetables.  For this she gets up at three in the morning to make the trip and be there on time.  Her husband helps her by looking after the store when she is away at the market. Vilma has worked since she was a very small girl.  Her parents did not have the resources to keep her to school beyond the fourth grade.  For this reason it is very important to her that her three children finish school. Two of them are currently in school and a third is still too young. And her continuing dream is to make enough money to give her children a good education.\nCurrently her monthly net profit from both businesses is 6,050 Guatemalan Quetzales.  By the end of the nine-month loan cycle she expects to increase that amount by 33%. She wants to invest her loan money in more vegetables and products for her little store and sales point at the market.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1975,"image":{"id":1820767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more products and vegetables for her store and sales point at the market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santiago, Sacatepequez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.635278 -90.676389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2015-02-26T20:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-28T20:00:14Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tizol Yucute De Sepez","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Haydee ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Cleta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":219.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":219.45,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:43:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636221235},{"amount":219.45,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:15:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649572949},{"amount":219.45,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-26T12:11:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665053597},{"amount":299.92,"local_amount":2277.87,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:57:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2290.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681351664},{"amount":358.41,"local_amount":2722.14,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:59:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2736.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696562053},{"amount":219.44,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711477241},{"amount":219.44,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-22T13:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730996058},{"amount":219.44,"local_amount":1666.64,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-26T13:11:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752084245}],"funded_date":"2015-03-16T19:53:43Z","paid_date":"2015-11-26T13:11:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":846101,"name":"Enrique Orlando","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Enrique Orlando lives in a community in the Department of Copan Honduras.

With the profits that she gains from this year\u2019s harvest, she plans to invest in a business.\r\n\r\nAnn and her group will receive a total of 12 solar lights as well as input loans of maize and fertilizer to plant a total of 7.75 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1806386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-02-26T20:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-28T20:40:06Z","loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hudson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wycliffe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agneta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":148060,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148060}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-24T16:28:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":845112,"name":"Evans's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evans's Group is formed by 10 farmers in Webuye District and is being represented by Evans, who is the group leader pictured above.

She is a smallholder farmer with extremely humble beginnings. She is based in Cherangany village in the North Rift region of Kenya. Her upbringing was difficult. She never managed to finish her primary education, but she is very determined to give the best life to her children. \r\n\r\nFifteen years ago, Agnes started farming on her husband's 1-acre farm. She did it mostly for subsistence until recently. She keeps a dairy cow that gives her 10 liters of milk every day for sale. She also grows vegetables that she uses to prepare food and to also sell. \r\n\r\nAgnes is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. The cow will produce additional milk for sale. This investment will not only double the income that Agnes is making from milk, but will also mitigate risks associated with having just one productive cow. The additional income will enable her to comfortably handle food and education costs, which happen to be her highest expenses.

The eight women who form \u201cLas Agricultoras\u201d are from a small rural community outside of the departmental capital, Santa Cruz el Quiche in the western highlands of Guatemala. The majority of the women in the group have very little formal education and primarily speak K\u2019iche, one of the many languages of Guatemala\u2019s large indigenous Maya population. Friendship Bridge loan officers provide monthly educational trainings on topics including women\u2019s empowerment, financial literacy, and health that are essential to the Microcredit Plus product, in the women\u2019s native language of K\u2019iche. These trainings allow the women to have access to education in their primary language, which helps them improve the probability of their businesses and quality of their home life.\r\n\r\nMagdalena is one of the most experienced members of \u201cLas Agricultoras,\u201d having worked with Friendship Bridge for over three years. A 46-year-old mother of six children, Magdalena, continues to support her four youngest children in their education. Magdalena is applying for a loan to maintain and grow the \u201ctortilleria\u201d (tortilla store) she has owned for over six years. The \u201ctortilleria\u201d employs her two married daughters who live in the capital city of Guatemala. Together the two daughters work from six in the morning until eight at night cooking and selling tortillas to local clients who buy freshly made tortillas for every meal. Magdalena operates the store from her small community in el Quiche, visiting the capital every other week to monitor the business.  \r\n\r\nWith the small loan, Magdalena plans to invest in a second stove, corn, gas and various cooking supplies, to increase the production of her toritlleria. According to Magdalena, the neighborhood where she operates her \u201ctortilleria,\u201d has not been overwhelmed by competition. In fact, she hopes to continue building capital for a potential expansion into another store in the neighborhood. With additional production capability in the original store, and the possibility of expanding, Magdalena hopes to reach a wider range of customers. \r\n\r\nWith the support of Kiva investors, Magdalena and the rest of the Trust Bank \u201cLas Argricultoras,\u201d will have the opportunity to realize their business goals. Thank you, Kiva investors, for believing in the ability of entrepreneurial women to improve their lives and the futures of their families through small businesses.

He is married and has four children. He has a very friendly family. They live in a rural area. All of the family members try to earn money somehow to provide income for the family. Everyone works as they can. Animal husbandry is Boboniyoz's primary and stable business. He fattens up and sells livestock. His wife helps him with this business. She cares for the livestock and also sells milk obtained from the livestock. The animal husbandry business yields Boboniyoz a good and stable income. This is why he wants to expand this business. He needs to buy several more heads of livestock for fattening up and subsequent resale. For this purpose, Boboniyoz came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy livestock. He hopes that this business will successfully grow and yield more profit in order to satisfactorily meet the family's needs. Boboniyoz thanks Arvand in advance for the support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":637.11,"image":{"id":1818223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock in order to expand his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Rudaki","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.133333 68.958333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-02-27T00:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-29T00:20:06Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Boboniyoz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100.35},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":106.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":107.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":109.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":113.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":115.06},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":119.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":128.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.35},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.42},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.24},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100.1,"local_amount":100.1,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":100.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666524443},{"amount":100.35,"local_amount":100.35,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:17:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681394718},{"amount":106.42,"local_amount":106.42,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-23T12:11:40Z","rounded_local_amount":106.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696605024},{"amount":107.17,"local_amount":107.17,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":107.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711524533},{"amount":109.92,"local_amount":109.92,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":109.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731040375},{"amount":113.15,"local_amount":113.15,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":113.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755520041}],"funded_date":"2015-03-25T11:01:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":842883,"name":"Baraka Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Neema est tr\u00e9sori\u00e8re du groupe Baraka.

","en":"Meet Salima, a 47-year-old resident of the Shahrituz district of Tajikistan.  Salima's family is quite small, consisting of herself, her husband, a son and a daughter.  Her son, the eldest of her children, is married.  Her husband is currently working in Russia because he couldn't find a good job in Tajikistan.  Salima is a very responsible and hardworking woman.  She and her husband do everything they can to earn a living and provide for the family.  Five years ago, Salima got involved in animal husbandry and started to take care of animals at home.  \r\n\r\nSalima has now decided to apply for a loan and to use it to buy additional cattle to expand her business.  She typically buys cattle, fattens her animals for a few months, and then resells them at the cattle market.  Animal husbandry is her source of income and, with the earnings from this business, she is able to provide for her family.  Salima doesn't want to lose her source of income, which is the reason for this loan.  She thanks you in advance for your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":308.22,"image":{"id":1821829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

lives in the Shahrituz district of Tajikistan.  She has a beautiful family: a husband and two children.  Her husband works as a construction foreman.  Mavjuda herself has been involved in retail for the past two years of her life.  She chose this activity because her brother is in the same business.  He was able to teach her how to interact with customers and how to run this type of business.  Mavjuda now sells women's shoes.  She has now decided to expand her activity and increase her turnover.  She hopes that, by increasing her inventory, she will be able to attract more customers.  Since she doesn't have enough personal funds, she is taking a loan.

To fund this project, she needs additional capital to purchase additional bags of cement, hollow blocks, loads of sand and gravel for her piggery, so she has requested a loan from Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC)."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":233.36,"image":{"id":1822210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional bags of cement, hollow blocks, loads of sand and gravel for her piggery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Ozamiz - Ozamis City Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":"2015-02-27T02:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-29T02:40:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:55:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1290.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636439021},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1290.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649707249},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-25T12:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1290.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":668181456},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T16:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1290.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681502217},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:24:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1290.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696708525},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T17:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1290.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711640312},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1290.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731145303},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1290.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752233841}],"funded_date":"2015-03-06T01:27:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":845392,"name":"Cheril","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cheril is 28 years old, married, and lives at Manla, Sapang Dalaga, Philippines.

Tajikistan.  She is 33 years old, married, and the mother of three children.  Her children are 12, 4 and 3 years old.  Like many residents of her district, Parvina works in agriculture.

Salima's family is very friendly; everyone helps everyone else.  Salima plants potatoes every year.  This year again she will be planting potatoes and she wants to get a good harvest.  For this reason, she is taking a loan which will help her to buy high-quality potato seeds.  In the future, she would like to expand her activity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1822381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy high quality potato seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahrituz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-02-27T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-29T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":29.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":29.43},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":30.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":32.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":32.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":35.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":35.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":36.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":38.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.57},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.19},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.86},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.88},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.01},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.69,"local_amount":29.69,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":29.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636349030},{"amount":29.43,"local_amount":29.43,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:11:25Z","rounded_local_amount":29.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649621561},{"amount":30.59,"local_amount":30.59,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":30.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665101532},{"amount":30.57,"local_amount":30.57,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":30.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681399645},{"amount":279.72,"local_amount":279.72,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":279.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696609720}],"funded_date":"2015-02-28T14:03:24Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T15:25:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":842889,"name":"Umoja Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Maman Vumilia est  \u00e2g\u00e9e de 46 ans, mari\u00e9e, m\u00e8re de 10 enfants tous scolaris\u00e9s et presidente de l\u2019association de cr\u00e9dit Umoja.

She is pregnant with her second child.  Her husband is a contractor.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Isabel raises poultry and cattle on a small farm at her home.  She buys large quantities of chicken seasonally, which she raises for two or three months, the time they need to be ready to sell.  After this time has passed, she turns them over to some local stores, or she also sells them by the pound at her home and on foot to dealers who come to her home.  She milks the cows and sells it by the liter; her husband helps her.

She was able to purchase more quantities and varieties of grocery items and products needed in her business.

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nMeriam looks forward to seeing her children having a better life through all her hard work in business. She also wants to save money and expand her business.
