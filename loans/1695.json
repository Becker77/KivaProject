Now it\u2019s time for you to meet one of Ruma's agents, Fadila. Fadila lives in Bogor, a suburban area located about an hour drive from Jakarta. She lives there with her husband and her children (one son and one daughter). She owns a small stall where she sells fuel and provides mobile payment services for her community (in the suburban area in Indonesia, it is easier to find a small stall that sells fuel than to find a big gas station). Fadila already joined Ruma since 2013. She knew Ruma from one of her friends who already became Ruma agent, and she decided to join Ruma because she wants to try another business opportunity.\r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Fadila is hoping to get another working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to provide more mobile payment services to her community, especially on weekends. Having known about the importance, your loan will be very useful to help Fadila improve her business and accordingly, her community, who needs access to such services.  As seen in the photo, Fadila is the one who is standing in her own small stall. She will be thankful for your kind support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1822366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to provide more mobile payment services for her community","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bogor Selatan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-02-27T16:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-29T16:20:18Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fadila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-01T13:26:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy McElroy","image":1095702}},{"id":845524,"name":"Sinet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sinet is a 22-year-old single student who lives in the Prey Veng province in Cambodia.

Now, as the business grows, Hawaisah is hoping to get another working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to provide more mobile payment services to her community, especially on weekends. Having known about the importance, your loan will be very useful to help Hawaisah improve her business and accordingly, her community who needs access to such services.

50-year-old married man, a happy father and grandfather. He was born and grew up in difficult times and, hence, was used to hard work since his childhood. Rahim completed 9 grades of a secondary school and then went to a technical college to study as an electrician. Now he works part-time as an electrician in his village. Rahim also has his own business. He is involved in animal husbandry. He has 3 cows and 10 sheep on his land. His wife milks the cows and prepares sour-cream and cottage cheese from the milk.

is a 40-year-old married Palestinian refugee, the father of two children, who works hard to provide them with a better living and is working hard to develop their living by moving out of the camp they

Lo mejor de tener su propio negocio es tener un ingreso para apoyar con los gastos de su hogar. Si bien al principio le fue un poco dif\u00edcil estabilizar su taquer\u00eda, principalmente por la competencia, sus precios y atenci\u00f3n a los clientes le ayudaron a tener \u00e9xito. Actualmente tambi\u00e9n tiene una cocina econ\u00f3mica y tres peque\u00f1os carros para vender churros y antojitos en las ferias de su comunidad. Deodora ama estar ocupada e invertir su tiempo de la mejor manera. Adem\u00e1s a cada uno de sus negocios y carrito de feria los ha llamado con el nombre de alguno de sus 5 hijos, para recordarles constantemente acerca del patrimonio que est\u00e1 consolidando para cada uno de ellos con base en su esfuerzo y compromiso.  \n\n\u201cLa experiencia hace la diferencia, adem\u00e1s del estilo de la preparaci\u00f3n de la carne\u201d comenta Deodora al hablar del atributo que la distingue en las ferias y bailes en los que tiene la fortuna de vender.\n\nActualmente Deodora necesita un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo el cual invertir\u00e1 en la compra de carne, chiles, ajo, jamaica, arroz, cebolla, mayonesa, leche, az\u00facar, pan, platos desechables, refrescos, jugos y agua para comenzar a prepararse para las ferias que hay en marzo.\n\n\u201cEstoy muy contenta el ver feliz a mi familia, eso me motiva y me da las fuerzas necesarias para iniciar un nuevo d\u00eda con buena actitud. Hace un mes mi hija Ari me dijo le gustar\u00eda tener su propio negocio\", Deodora apoy\u00f3 a su hija quien maneja una tienda de abarrotes ubicada al lado de la taquer\u00eda, lo que la hace sentirse de orgullo al saber que sus hijos est\u00e1n siguiendo su ejemplo de trabajar por lo que quieren lograr. \n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en la taquer\u00eda de do\u00f1a Deodora quien viste falda color azul marino.

They are: Deodora, who sells tacos and sandwiches; Dora, who sells catalog footwear; Ana, who sells cosmetics, catalog footwear, and silver; and Soledad, who sells chicken.\r\n\r\nBeing part of a family of businesspersons was what motivated Deodora to sell tacos and sandwiches ten years ago, and the best part of having her own business is having an income to help with her home\u2019s expenses.   Although it was a little difficult to establish her taco stand, mainly because of competition, her prices and customer service helped her to become successful.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, she also has a food stand and three small wagons for selling churros and antojitos [traditional snacks] at fairs in her community.  Deodora loves being busy and investing her time in the best way possible; she has also named each of her businesses and wagons after one of her five children, in order to constantly remind them of the legacy that she is building for each one of them through her effort and commitment.\r\n\r\n\u201cExperience makes the difference, in addition to the way the meat is prepared\u201d, comments Deodora, when speaking of the attribute that distinguishes her at the fairs and dances in which she is fortunate to be able to sell.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Deodora needs a new loan, which she will invest in the purchase of meat, peppers, garlic, allspice, rice, onions, mayonnaise, milk, sugar, bread, disposable plates, soft drinks, juices, and water, in order to begin preparing for the fairs in March.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very glad to see that my family is happy. That motivates me and gives me the strength I need to start the new day with a good attitude.  A month ago, my daughter Ari told me that she wanted to have her own business.\u201d  Deodora supported her daughter, who runs a grocery store next to the taco stand.  It makes her feel proud, knowing that her children are following her example of working for what they want to achieve.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in Do\u00f1a Deodora\u2019s taco stand.

Actualmente he tomado todas las materias del nivel inicial del cual puedo decir que Fundamentos de Fisiolog\u00eda y Biof\u00edsica son mis materias favoritas.\nEstoy solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para mis estudios debido a que el nivel en que estoy es dif\u00edcil conseguir empleo y tener un buen desarrollo acad\u00e9mico.

He is requesting this loan to pay for his studies and this is his story: \r\n\r\n\"My name is Leonardo. I am 23 years old and currently live in La Ermita in the Gurabo sector. I have 3 sisters and 1 brother. I am single, I don't have any children, and I am currently living with one of my sisters and my mother, who works as a nurse. \r\n\r\nCurrently, I study medicine at UTESA-Santiago. I chose my major because, since I was little, I have always wanted to learn what we're made of, which processes happen within human beings, and why they happen. Currently, I have taken all of the entry-level classes, and of those, I can say that 'Fundamentals of Physiology' and 'Biophysics' are my favorite subjects. \r\n\r\nI am requesting this loan for my studies because, at the level I'm at, it's hard to get a job and make progress academically. My mother has been helping me with the cost of my studies but she was just diagnosed with a terminal illness and, from there, things have gotten complicated. This assistance would be a big boost for me. I see it as a way of making my studies easier, as it's been difficult and it's taken a lot of effort to make it this far. It would definitely turn everything around for me. \r\n\r\nMy goal is to prepare myself and make it to the end of my major with the best academic average possible. I want to work as a doctor and be an example for those who say they can't overcome adversity. I want to bring my family together and, above all, bring my mother peace, so that she can stop working so much and to be able look after her like she deserves. My dream is to help improve the lives of others and to bring about positive changes in society. \"

The group is composed of 9 members and is headed by a board, where Mrs. Marizol is the President. The members of this community association are involved in businesses including: neighbourhood store, CD sales, salchipapas (kebab) sales, clothing sales, beauty salon, blanket sales, vegetable sales, fruit sales. Mrs. Marizol was integral to getting the loan that achieved benefits for the small microentrepreneurs. She points out that it has been one year since making up Pro Mujer, joining at the invitation of a massive promotion at the institution that helps realize goals in her region. Currently Mrs. Marizol has a business selling food. She discloses that she learned this business a year ago to help with the family business of her aunt. Afterwards she decided to start an independent business. The loan she asks for now is for the increase of capital by buying wholesale rice and noodles from the wholesale sellers in the city of La Paz, which she can subsequently sell at her stall.

He is an entrepreneur, patient, strong, optimistic, responsible, and hardworking. His work developed in the 'Condoriri' community which is located at the foot of a glacier area. 15 snowy peaks lead below to the formation of grasslands, wetlands and emerald lakes rich in bird life. Llamas and alpacas walk in the hills, deer run to their hideouts to avoid the stalking of the condors--it is a corner of Andean magic. This place is located 4400 metres above sea level with a cold and dry climate. Ruben is dark-skinned with black short hair, dark eyes, low stature, and a slender physique. His mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1 which is spoken in this place and he also speaks Spanish for general culture. He cares for his parents who are quite elderly and can no longer work. They live in their own house built of adobe that has well water and electricity. Ruben's business is trading cattle. He makes a living buying calves for fattening and selling. \"Currently we are busy with an improved cattle trade, they have better value at the market and adapt better to the climate conditions in this place,\" he says. His dream is to have a large barn where he can keep the cattle in better conditions. He wants to make the purchase of calves for rearing and fattening. This is the first sequence of loans with this institution in 7 years that has been doing this activity independently. It is for these reasons that Ruben is applying for a loan to buy calves for rearing and fattening and therefore benefits to care for his parents.

He is married and has a beautiful 4-year-old daughter. Tomas lives with his wife in the community of Chichicastenango. Tomas is a kind and responsible man. He works from sunrise to sunset so that his family will not lack anything. For the last eight years, Tomas has worked in construction. He works very far away, which is tiring. It is a long trek to get to work, but to Tomas, the most important thing is to have a job from which to support his family. For him, there is nothing more important than his family.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, Tomas has realized that by next year, his house will be in very bad condition for the rainy season. His house is in need of repairs and he and his wife have considered remodeling it, but they lack the money to do so. For this reason, Tomas decided to request a loan of 4,000 quetzales that he will use to buy doors, metal sheets, and floor materials. Tomas' dream is to be able to remodel his house this year and continue working to pay back the loan. Eventually he hopes to become a master builder."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350.79,"image":{"id":1823119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

They live in Daniela's mother and father-in-law's house, where they have potable water, electricity, and a sewage system. In her business, Daniela sells CD's, movies on DVD and blu-ray. Her business is consistent because there are several high schools in the area. Young people are her biggest clients buying all kinds of movies and music. \"I started out working in a business, making copies, then I quit and started my own business,\" she said. \r\n\r\nDaniela's dream is to have another business in the central region. She hopes to furnish her business, buying tables and display cases on which she can show her merchandise. This is Daniela's first loan cycle with the institution in her first year of working independently. For these reasons Daniela is requesting a loan: to furnish her business and improve her sales, which will benefit her family.

Caroline is a smallholder mixed farmer from Terige, a village in the North Rift area of Kenya. She has been blessed with a lovely family. She has been a farmer for five years, producing milk, eggs and maize for both consumption and sale. Caroline's entrepreneurial spirit extends outside agriculture: She is involved in other personal businesses for extra income.\r\n\r\nCaroline is very ambitious. She enjoys making more and more returns but lack of adequate capital puts her on a leash. It is for this reason that she is turning to Kiva lenders for a loan. Caroline is seeking KES 30,000 to purchase a cow. With more cows, she will be able to utilize the pasture on her farm and increase milk production.\r\n\r\nYour loan will help Caroline to pull herself out of poverty through constantly growing her asset base. The cow you will finance will reproduce, and with time Caroline will produce many litres of milk and other dairy products. This improvement in her business will enable her to realize profits that are currently cut due to the high cost of inputs. It will impact the rest of her family in a very meaningful way."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":227.38,"image":{"id":1821499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-27T23:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-29T23:20:14Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.43,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.45,"local_amount":5181.7,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5525.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265149},{"amount":47.21,"local_amount":4046.79,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4315.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459798},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":1453.65,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1550.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.29,"payment_id":696587880},{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":3675.38,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3919.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.97,"payment_id":711506168},{"amount":58.71,"local_amount":5132.27,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":5472.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.17,"payment_id":752111163}],"funded_date":"2015-03-01T19:21:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":837670,"name":"Pierre Celestin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pierre Celestin is 47 years old.

Since his youth, he has been working as a farmer (growing fruits and vegetables) and helping his parents to take care of the livestock.  Eighteen years after he got married, Boymat has now decided to continue his father's business and to start his own animal husbandry business.  Boymat has had some difficult times, because he has had to provide for his family and also take care of his elderly parents.  His wife helps him with everything.  Boymat currently owns and takes care of two cows and five sheep.  He is planning to buy two lambs, but he doesn't have enough money for this purchase.

of Kenya, has never secured one and has opted to be a smallholder farmer. He decided that he will be independent and contribute to his community by practicing mixed farming. Erick is blessed with two beautiful children whom he refers to as his \"heart beat.\u201d His primary sources of income are milk and poultry farming, as well as some personal business that he does to supplement his meager income (Donkey business). Deciding to practice poultry farming for Erick was not difficult. \u201cI was brought up with chickens raised by my grandfather and grandmother,\u201d Erick said. \u201cIt is in my blood.\u201d For the past five years, Erick has been earning a decent income from poultry farming. However, the demand is overwhelming and he wants to increase his poultry, but the biggest challenge is lack of funds. He is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. Poultry farming has become one of the most important aspects of agriculture in Kenya because it creates business opportunity for entrepreneurs and it\u2019s a kind of business that can never dry up. Poultry farming is a less strenuous activity that is profitable. Many poultry farmers find a sense of fulfillment having hens all over their homestead. The hens lay eggs that can be consumed or sold.

Her husband works as a driver before, earning only PhP 300 - 400 per day which could hardly suffice for their family's most basic needs. \n\nIn order to help her husband earn their keep, Analiza took consigned dried shrimps and fish from a friend and sold it to her community. In the beginning, she was entrusted with 100 kilos of dried shrimps and fish and sold it at PhP 70 per kilo which she is able to sell out at PhP 100 per kilo in a week's time. On her first week of sales, Analiza was able to gain a net of PhP 3,000, of which she used PhP 1,000 as initial capital to directly buy dried shrimps and fish from her friend's suppliers. With this important step, Analiza is able to have a net of PhP 50 per kilo compared to only PhP 30 per kilo under consignment terms. \n\nAnaliza came to know of SEED through a neighbor and was invited to attend an orientation seminar. She decided to try availing a loan to finance the demanded volume increase of the dried shrimps and fish she is selling. Analiza consequently availed a first loan which helped her to increase her stocks and sales. Now, Analiza was able to deliver dried shrimp and fish not only in their community market but also to other neighboring town markets. From this, her income also grew and she was able to gain a net income of PhP 15,000 a week. With the improved business and income, Analiza's husband resigned from his job and helped her instead in the business by taking charge of delivery of goods. \n\nAnaliza, being a mother and having a kind heart, and through the improvements in her business over time was able to employs a helper who repacks the dried shrimps and fish for retail selling. Her helper is a neighbor who is also widow with 2 children to support. \n\nToday, Analiza is requesting a loan amounting to PhP 50,000 to buy 10 sacks of dried anchovies and 3 sacks of dried shrimps to fill the orders of her customers. With this she is confident of further increasing her income and plans to provide employment and livelihood opportunities to other unemployed neighbors in the community. She says that with increased volume of inventories, she will be needing helpers for repacking as well as be able to offer consignment to other neighbors for their extra income.

is 62 years old, married and with 4 children. The oldest is 34 and the youngest is 19 years old. Her husband is a retired Philippine Navy, now working as a repairman in his own electrical appliances repair shop. Bernandita used to have a sari-sari (small grocery store) store back in their hometown, but later closed it when they moved in Manila for her husband's work re-assignment. \n\nAt that time,  with all her children still attending school and with the house rent and other expenses, her husband's salary is not enough. To help her husband, she decided to build a sari-sari store in front of their rented house. She also brought processed and frozen meat goods (hotdogs, sausages and sweetened pork meat) in her husband's workplace and sold it to her husband's co-workers where she earns a net of PhP 300-400 daily. Because of the flourishing income, she wanted to expand her business but the lack of capital prevents her from doing so.\n\nBernandita came to know SEED from a friend whom is also a member and invited her to attend an orientation. Her first loan amounting to Php 5,000 were invested on additional stocks (canned goods, laundry powders, soft drinks, coffee, snack foods and additional frozen goods (hotdogs, sausages, preserved sweetened pork meat. \n\nThrough a series of loan, Bernandita's business improved. She was able to expand her store's place to hold much larger stocks. She now has 1 tricycle with a hired driver and a new freezer for her processed frozen goods. She also bought another motorcycle and most of all, with the revenue of her income she was able to help finance her children education until 3 of them graduated in college. Now at the age of 62, she still has 1 child in college, though her husband received pension from his former job, it\u2019s still not enough to cover the education of her child and their expenses.

He is an exemplary family man.  He is married and raising two children.  Unfortunately, he is not working at the moment.  He has tried very hard to find a job but, in the end, he has decided to start his own business and to offer his services as a handyman.  He has many skills.

He travels to different markets in various communities to make purchases of cattle such as bulls, calves and cows, then transports them to other markets to sell. It is a job which requires a lot of knowledge of livestock conditions. \r\n\r\n\"I travel constantly to livestock markets, buying bred cattle and regional breeds also, I give them vaccinations and sometimes care for them for a period of time, then I sell them...\" he says. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to have a truck to transport the cattle, he wants to make the purchase of dairy cows because they are fat in this season and the best opportunity is this type of cow. This is his 2nd loan cycle with this institution in the 16 years he has been in this business.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Justiniano is requesting a loan to purchase a dairy cow, to then sell

He is particularly passionate about dairy farming. His main sources of income are milk, eggs and other personal business. \r\n\r\nLike any serious dairy farmer, Benard takes animal health very seriously. He drenches drugs to his dairy animals from time to time, an activity he really enjoys. However, he says the major challenge to dairy farmers in his area is lack of quality breeds of animals. \r\n\r\nBenard is seeking a loan to purchase a good-quality dairy cow. This cow produces more than 20 litres of milk daily. Milk sold from this cow will provide Benard with a significant amount of income on a daily basis and enough to clear the loan repayments on time. \r\n\r\nBenard has a clear business plan. Juhudi Kilimo smallholder farmers\u2019 microfinance has been very encouraging and supportive to such progressive farmers. We want his farm to be an example to other farmers who have potential but are constrained by funds. Benard says the extra income he will generate will enable him to save enough money to buy a pedigreed dairy cow."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":270.26,"image":{"id":1821494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a good-quality dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-02-28T00:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-30T00:40:10Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.8,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2580.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2655.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2813.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2895.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2980.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3067.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3157},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3249.26},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3344.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3441.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3542.55},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3646.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3752.63},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3862.31},{"due_date":"2016-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3975.18},{"due_date":"2016-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4091.36},{"due_date":"2016-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4210.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.51},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.85},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.02},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.45},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.72},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.03},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.14,"local_amount":2412.7,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2480.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265179},{"amount":70.58,"local_amount":6273.77,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:46Z","rounded_local_amount":6451,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459838},{"amount":30.06,"local_amount":2700.41,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2776.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.32,"payment_id":681378215},{"amount":105.57,"local_amount":9634.85,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":9907.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.82,"payment_id":731023042},{"amount":33.11,"local_amount":3001.43,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3086.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.66,"payment_id":752111187}],"funded_date":"2015-03-24T14:32:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":843236,"name":"Jacqueline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacqueline is 23 years old.

Candelaria is a woman who fights for her dreams and in order to make this change she is requesting a loan to buy yarns of different colors and brands. \r\n\r\nCandelaria's hope is to receive the loan as soon as possible. In that way she can continue making beautiful traditional clothing and start a store to exhibit her garments with the earnings she receives.

She is very excited about this addition since now she will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.\r\n\r\nUsing this loan, Mary's Group will purchase a total of 15 solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 6.25 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1822683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase two solar lights, as well as hybrid seeds and fertilizer to improve harvests of maize.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-02-28T13:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-30T13:20:03Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela Nanjala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Frida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sorophine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes M","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayub","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Iraga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronilla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":134140,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134140}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-25T06:01:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":845787,"name":"Lubov","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lubov has been selling children's clothes and toys for 17 years. \r\n\r\nThanks to Kiva loans, she was able to increase her assortment of products.

She is a cross-border trader who specializes in buying clothes and shoes for resale. Tracey sadly lost her husband when her fourth youngest child was just three months old. This was devastating to her and her family as they were left destitute and with nowhere to turn to. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her friend, who is also a member of the Goodlife Group, Tracey got a passport and started cross-border trading to South Africa and Zambia in 1999. The economic hardships made it difficult for her to maintain her business. She faced difficulties in taking her children to proper schools, clothing them, feeding them and providing decent shelter for them. It was during this time that Tracy was introduced to Thrive.

She has no children and her business is selling breakfasts. She is entrepreneurial, a fighter, stable, responsible and hardworking. She runs her business in the southern part of the city characterized by its soil, which is predominantly fine and silty sand. It has a warm, sub-tropical climate. The two months that have the most rain are January and February. \r\n\r\nEliana has golden brown skin, long black hair she wears in a pony tail, and a thin build. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks in her family, and she speaks Spanish in the general culture and for business (she is seated, wearing a pink blouse). She shares her life with her parents, who work. They live in a rented house made of brick with a sheet metal roof. It has potable water, electricity and plumbing. Her desire to get ahead led to her leading a bank for people with businesses such as selling traditional food, a neighborhood store, selling chicken, selling empanadas, selling second hand clothes, making and selling gelatin, and selling cleaning products. The bank was started so they could ask for a loan and expand their activities. Her business is selling breakfasts, such as api (a hot or cold drink made with purple corn), accompanied by cu\u00f1ap\u00e9s (baked flour dough with cheese), tojor\u00ed (milk and corn), or zonzo (yucca with cheese), among others. \u201cIn the morning I sell the breakfasts, later from the afternoon until night I do my second activity, I work as a hairdresser,\u201d she says. Her dream is to have a kiosk in her house to sell the breakfasts. She wants to buy the cooking ingredients wholesale for the api, tojor\u00ed, cu\u00f1apes, yucca and more. This is her second cycle of loans with the institution during the year she has been doing this activity independently. \r\n\r\nThat is why Eliana is asking for a loan to buy ingredients to make breakfasts to serve a larger number of customers.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":1823126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to make breakfasts and serve a larger number of customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-02-28T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-30T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Corina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lisbeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yoselin Julieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eleoteria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-26T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":1779.29},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T04:00:00Z","amount":1842.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":1876.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T04:00:00Z","amount":1910.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T04:00:00Z","amount":1945.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T04:00:00Z","amount":1980.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T04:00:00Z","amount":2016.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T04:00:00Z","amount":2053.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T04:00:00Z","amount":2090.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T04:00:00Z","amount":2128.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T04:00:00Z","amount":2167.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T04:00:00Z","amount":2207.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.63},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":271.69},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":276.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":286.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":292.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":313.86},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":319.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1072.78,"local_amount":7409.15,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":7412.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214337},{"amount":568.47,"local_amount":3926.08,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3928.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564457},{"amount":589.34,"local_amount":4070.28,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4072.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046423},{"amount":924.85,"local_amount":6387.46,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":6390.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344244},{"amount":319.56,"local_amount":2207.03,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2208.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554466}],"funded_date":"2015-03-02T01:49:23Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":845813,"name":"Gigilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gigilyn is 34 years old and married.
