She lives in a village close to Khurda city in the Khurda district in Odisha. Manjulata got married to a fisherman when she was 20 years old. Like other village folk, her husband was a fisherman who went to a nearby lake and river for fishing. Unfortunately, Manjulata lost her husband's mental and partly physical condition in 2002 in an accident when he went fishing. Since then, she has been working hard to support her children. \r\n\r\nManjulata started her business of selling fresh fish and dried fish. Drying the fish is a way of preserving the fish for future use by drying them in the sun until the water is completely evaporated. Dried fish has a storage life of several years. Dried fish is used in different delicacies just as fresh fish is and is very popular in the region. Manjulata buys fish directly from the local fishermen, sells some fresh, and dries some to sell as dried fish. She purchases 10 to 12 kg of fresh fish and 18-20 kg of dried fish and sells it by roaming door to door in the nearby villages. She earns 4,000 INR per month. \r\n\r\nManjulata, along with her group, has applied for a loan of 135,000 INR so that she can use her portion to purchase the fish in bulk to make more dried fish and stock up during the monsoon season. There is a huge demand for dried fish during the monsoon season as not much stock is available in the market. So she can get a better price as well. \r\n\r\nThis loan will help Manjulata to increase her working capital to run her business by increasing her revenues almost 50%, giving her 5,000 to 6,000 INR per month.

She is 43 years old, married and from this relationship they have 6 children, 5 adults and one 17 year old who works. An 8 year old grandson studying in the third grade lives with them. Her husband is a cabinet maker and they live in their own home. \r\n\r\nMaryori is a very good wife who tries to help her husband with the difficult household burden. She takes out the loans to share with her husband. He has had a cabinet making shop for 30 years. He makes all types of furniture (doors, closets, beds, etc.). She has a small farm at her house in which she works raising pigs. Once they are of an adequate weight she sells them whole to traders or laborers and she sells by the pound to her neighbors. In this way, she also earns her own and along with that of her husband gives them the basics to continue forward. \r\n\r\nShe is going to use this loan to buy wood, paint and food and medicine for the pigs. She has been here since the start of the communal bank and likes it because of the help they have given her with the loans. Her dream is to recondition her home.

Annah has been married to Matayo for over 30 years and they have 6 children together. Maintaining a family of 6 children can be challenging and so it requires parents who are ready to go an extra mile to provide and support the family unit. \r\n\r\nWhen Annah got married, she made use of her husband's 3-acre land to start a small rural farm enterprise. Today, the farm is covered in trees, crops and grass (for her dairy cows). Annah's most recent business move was to venture into the cereal trade where the demand for ugali, Kenya's staple food made out of cereal grains, maintains high market prices. \r\n\r\nYour loan investment in Annah will raise her family's net income which will result in better living. Adding cereals into her product portfolio will not only grow her business but also bring about diversity and better risk management.

However, long before Uber became widespread, Julio recognized the advantage of providing cheaper transportation services to his community.  Fourteen years ago, he started his own company as a means of earning money on a self-controlled schedule. \r\n\r\nOriginally, from the Dominican Republic, Julio is currently an Uber driver. He lives with his son, and supports all his three children. Always looking for ways to improve his business, Julio currently struggles with the need to purchase a new car, while simultaneously lacking the working capital to do so. \r\n\r\nThis loan will enable him to buy a new car and improve the quality and scope of his services. In the future, he hopes to use profits generated from this investment to purchase  more than one car, and be able to grow his business and better support his family.

She remembers starting with two very worn-out nets since she did not have money to buy more and in time she expanded her work tools.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she will take out now is to increase capital (buy nets) that she will acquire from the wholesale sellers in her community and later she will implement it in her workspace. This form of work allows her to generate resources to support her family economically. She is married and has nine children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she replies that she likes the benefits that the institution offers.\r\n\r\nIn the photo one member is absent, the one who departed with urgency to care for her cattle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6250,"image":{"id":1824106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy nets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2015-03-01T00:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-31T00:20:01Z","loan_amount":6250,"lender_count":151,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flavio\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisabeth\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":43000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":6250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4841.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":5014.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5151},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5291.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5436.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5584.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5736.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5943.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":703.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":728.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":748.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":769.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":790.12},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":811.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":863.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":703.75,"local_amount":4841.8,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:11:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4855.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636607111},{"amount":728.92,"local_amount":5014.92,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-23T12:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5029.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650950369},{"amount":748.69,"local_amount":5151,"processed_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5165.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665057769},{"amount":769.16,"local_amount":5291.84,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:07:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5306.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681355626},{"amount":1601.81,"local_amount":11020.48,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":11051.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696565858},{"amount":833.79,"local_amount":5736.48,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:58:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5752.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711481798},{"amount":863.88,"local_amount":5943.48,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5960.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731000333}],"funded_date":"2015-03-19T06:18:14Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T14:36:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauren Potter","image":1606278}},{"id":846905,"name":"Las Productivas De Pomamaya Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cLAS PRODUCTORAS DE POMAMAYA\u201d iniciar\u00e1 el segundo ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Copacabana, est\u00e1 compuesta por ocho  integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Ninfa es la Secretaria.

His father also did the same. Omar knows the characteristics of fresh fish: it has little odor and no bad odor. Its scaly skin must have firm scales that don't come off easily and they must be shiny. The fish' eyes must not be cloudy or opaque. Also, the color of the gils must be pinkish and the peritoneum should adhere to the body without breaking or detaching easily. All of these are elements that determine the freshness of the products that Omar sells. He works Monday through Sunday from 8 in the morning until 8 at night in order to achieve his goals such as improving the business' image and increasing his and his family's quality of life. His most important challenge is achieving financing sources to improve his inventory by buying in greater volumes. Right now he has resolves this obstacle, applying for a Kiva loan. This is the first loan he has taken out with the  Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it he will buy gutted bocachicos, bream, snapper, etc. He hopes to sell them this season which is one that has high sales and he can earn a little more.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1824158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to buy bocachicos, bream, snapper, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-03-01T01:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-31T01:20:06Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.03,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Omar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":51993},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":58786},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":60402},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":62063},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":63770},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":65524},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":67326},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":69177},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":71080},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":79879}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.07},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":258.97,"local_amount":650000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":683705.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.03,"payment_id":730994272}],"funded_date":"2015-03-10T06:58:55Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T14:24:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":846182,"name":"Editha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Editha is a married woman with four children, two of whom are in school.

Being able to contribute to what her husband of 15 years provides surely gives her a great sense of joy.\r\n\r\nOne way in which Ann has chosen to increase her income is through improving milk production on her farm. To achieve a state where her three dairy cows are in perfect health, Ann is seeking a loan investment from Kiva lenders to buy a chaff cutter to cut hay into small even pieces that the cows will enjoy. With more to chew, they will need more to drink and this will lead to more milk for Ann's family to consume and sell. \r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1822962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a chaff cutter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-01T02:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-31T02:00:04Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.95,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.14},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.78,"local_amount":11002.97,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:44Z","rounded_local_amount":11319.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265215},{"amount":48.81,"local_amount":4338.48,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4463.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459877},{"amount":107.12,"local_amount":9616.55,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:49Z","rounded_local_amount":9893.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.07,"payment_id":681378249},{"amount":376.34,"local_amount":35042,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":36051.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.88,"payment_id":711506227}],"funded_date":"2015-03-11T00:08:26Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":846885,"name":"Maria De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda es una mujer campesina, luchadora, echada para adelante a sus 64 a\u00f1os de a\u00f1os es soltera y supo desempe\u00f1ar el papel de madre y padre, vive cerca a sus hija y juntas se mantiene, su responsabilidad y su nobleza son muy reconocidos por los vecinos del sector y es esta manera de ser la que le ha dado \u00e9xito en su negocio.\nMar\u00eda se dedica a la cr\u00eda y levante de pollos y gallinas, sus impecables cocheras, su responsabilidad para alimentarlos con ma\u00edz hacen que estos animales sean muy apetecidos por los clientes.\nSu mayor sue\u00f1o es mejorar las condiciones de vivienda, enchapar el ba\u00f1o, revocar paredes, pintar, reparar el patio, reparar el lavado, comprar electrodom\u00e9sticos muchas cosas para embellecer su hogar.\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de materiales para construir una cochera para iniciar en el negocio de ganado porcino, comprar una cerda de cr\u00eda y lechones y el resto de capital en gallinas ponedoras. \n \n","en":"Mar\u00eda is a farming woman and a fighter, pushing ahead at age 64.

Khujand is also considered the northern capital. Mahfuza is married and has one child. Her husband works as a welder. Her son is 21. He is a student. Mahfouz makes shawls. She sews scarves and embroiders them. Mahfuza has been doing this for five years. She loves her job and wants to continue to work in this field.

Despite her busy schedule and the hard work involved, Dilnoza wants to start her own business in animal husbandry. She decided to start buying and selling cattle so that she can earn a decent income and provide her children with everything they need. Since she does not have much cash, she has applied for a loan.

Mairamkan is 50 years old, married and the mother of four. Mairamkan has received secondary education. As an additional source of income for her family, she raises livestock and grows farm crops, having launched this business in 1994. Thanks to Mairamkan's hard work, at present she has three cows and 10 sheep; she also has  a land plot of 1.76  ha [4.3 acres], where she grows clover for use on her farm as well as for resale. In order to develop her business further, Mairamkan has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 30,000 KGS to buy sheep. Mairamkan plans to use the resulting revenue for an additional increase of livestock and also to keep saving for home renovations.

This year is her fifteenth year in a happy marriage that gave her four children between ages 7 and 15 years.\r\n\r\nMildred only started farming in 2005, but her passion for dairy and poultry farming only gets stronger by the day.

","en":"Zhumabu is 52 years old, a widow, and the mother of three children.  She has a secondary education and works in agriculture.  She currently has two cows and 12 sheep.  She makes a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS), which is not enough to afford a decent life.  For this reason, she has decided to further develop her activity.  She has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy livestock for breeding, which will allow her to increase her livestock headcount and her profits.  She is planning to use the earnings from her loan to grow her business.  She would also like to save enough money to build a new house for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":597.35,"image":{"id":1823898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase additional livestock in order to increase her income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Kulzha village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-03-01T05:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-31T05:00:04Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.07,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zhumabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3831},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3651},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3758},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3867},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3980},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4096},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4216},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4339},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4465},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4596},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4730},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4471}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.21},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.45,"local_amount":7482,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:46:02Z","rounded_local_amount":7552.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636161745},{"amount":62.01,"local_amount":3758,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3793.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649514150},{"amount":63.81,"local_amount":3867,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3903.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995902},{"amount":65.67,"local_amount":3980,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4017.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291327},{"amount":67.59,"local_amount":4096,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:53:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4134.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500566},{"amount":69.56,"local_amount":4216,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:05:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4255.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711411487},{"amount":70.26,"local_amount":4339,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:59:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4380.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.33,"payment_id":730933727},{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":4465,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4507.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.74,"payment_id":752025786}],"funded_date":"2015-03-03T14:12:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":843606,"name":"Ako\u00e9l\u00e9","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ako\u00e9l\u00e9 vit \u00e0 Atti\u00e9gou aves ses cinq enfants \u00e0 sa charge.

In order to provide a source of income for her family, she started raising livestock and growing crops five years ago.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has two cows on her farm.

Now it's time for you to meet one of Ruma's agents, Nanang. Nanang lives in Bogor, a suburban area located about one hour from Jakarta. Nanang lives there with his wife. He owns a small stall where he sells small snacks and drinks, and provides mobile payment services to his community. His community sees him as a trusted, friendly and cheerful mobile payment service provider. \r\n\r\nNanang joined Ruma in 2014. He knew of Ruma through one of his friends who was already an agent. With assistance and support from Ruma\u2019s staff, Nanang sees improvements in his business. As the business grows, he hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva.

For this reason, she has taken out loans that her husband can use for his work.  He raises pigs and poultry on the small farm located at their house.  On a seasonal basis, they buy a large quantity of chickens and raise them over a two to three month period.  When the time is right, the chickens are delivered to shops in town or sold by the pound.  The pigs are butchered and the meat is sold by the pound.  They also sell eggs, cheese, and butter.  By working in this manner, Sonia is able to earn some income from home for the benefit of her family.  <br \/><br \/>This new loan will be used to buy chickens, animal feed, and medicines.

I am getting comfortable with the fact that I will have to study throughout my whole career path. My motto is: 'Take as much knowledge as you can now, you will thank yourself for your hard work later'.\r\n\r\nI live with my mother and younger sister, who is 15 years old. My parents are divorced and my father lives separate from us and, in fact, he doesn\u2019t help us. The three of us live in our relative\u2019s apartment as we don\u2019t have our own house. My mother is 42 years old and she is a civil servant. Her wage is, on average, 590 USD per month. We don\u2019t have a car or real estate from which we could earn a profit, so we do live within our means. My mother works hard to provide for the three of us, but it\u2019s really hard for her to pay for our daily necessities and pay for my tuition.

The previous loan helped her to process more mobile phone airtime credits for her community and she therefore thanks all the lenders.\r\n\r\nWith support from Ruma staff, Patimah sees that her business has improved. Now, as the business grows, she is hoping to receive another working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to provide more mobile payment services to her community, especially on weekends. Knowing about its importance, your loan will be very useful in helping Patimah to improve her business and, accordingly, helping her community which needs access to such services. She will be thankful for your kind and endless support. Patimah is sitting in the above photo.

He is a member of the Nyagika 2011 Group and describes himself as ambitious. Joseph practises mixed farming by growing vegetables such as cabbages, kale and potatoes, and dairy farming.
