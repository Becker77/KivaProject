It requires more maintenance charges on daily basis. \r\n\r\nDue to insufficient financial means, he is unable to do maintenance on his taxi. Therefore Shakeela has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan, Shakeela's husband can afford the maintenance cost easily. This way, he will provide better transport facilities and will be able to earn a profitable income. \r\n\r\nShakeela  also plans to make savings with the profits of her husband's income to meet her family's needs in future.

He is the only one responsible for feeding the entire family and managing the household.\r\n\r\nHe needs to purchase different types of clothes in bulk for reselling purposes, but due to insufficient financial means he is unable to purchase these clothes. Therefore Rizwana is applying for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan in order to assist her husband to purchase these clothes in bulk for his business. He can also increase the size of his business and earn maximum profit with the help of this loan amount. \r\n\r\nRizwana is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

She is a 50 year old Malian, and her husband is a farmer. She has five children of whom one goes to school. She is a housewife and was not able to go to school. She raises sheep. She buys the younger sheep and fattens them up for a few months, then she sells them at a favourable time. This is why she borrows money from RMCR to buy sheep for fattening. She buys her sheep at the market in her village and sells them at the town market. From the sales, she can earn up to 25000FCFA per month. With these profits she supports her family by paying health care, school fees, and clothing for the children. She has four years experience in livestock farming. She has not had any problems in this business. In addition to this activity she would also like to sell condiments. Added to the interest that this project has engendered, she is much encouraged by the organic fertiliser that her livestock produce, which lowers the cost of buying other fertiliser for their field."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1820356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep for fattening and resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"DIDIENI","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":438,"posted_date":"2015-03-01T13:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-31T13:40:07Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Dado","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Facouma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Koura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"S\u00e9di\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sin\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seba Soungo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diongouda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Di\u00e9gu\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":650000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1150,"local_amount":650000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":663646.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681874030}],"funded_date":"2015-03-01T21:33:00Z","paid_date":"2015-07-18T12:13:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":846989,"name":"Marlene Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Grupo De Cr\u00e9dito Nuevos Horizontes se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en el Cant\u00f3n Jipijapa, cant\u00f3n conocido con el nombre de la sultana del caf\u00e9 por los extensos cultivos de caf\u00e9 el cual tiene un sabor incomparable, por su gastronom\u00eda y por la calidez de su gente. \nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Marlene, tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen 3 hijos, dos mayores de edad y una de 15 a\u00f1os la cual estudian en colegio, todos sus hijos aun viven con ellos.

Some years ago, she decided to support her family by stitching ladies' suits at her home for the people of her town, as her father's income was barely enough to meet their day-to-day expenses.

She is borrowing from RMCR to buy sheep for raising with a view to reselling them. She has four years' experience in this field. She buys sheep at the market in their village then fattens them up. In due course she resells them at the same market. The estimated profit she makes per head after selling the sheep is 25,000FCFA.

His business is transporting construction material by truck.\r\n\r\nHe is an entrepreneur, independent, patient, constant, responsible, and hard working. His work is carried out in the Kalajahuira zone, located northeast of the city. This is the largest zone in the municipality, with a cold and dry climate and a temperature that varies daily between 2- 16 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nRafael's skin is dark, his hair black and short, his stature short, his eyes dark, and his physical complexion robust. His mother tongue is Aymara which he speaks among family, while speaking Spanish in the general culture. He shares the work with his wife who sells meals. Their children are independent and have their own families. Rafael lives in his own house, constructed of bricks with a sheet metal roof, and has electricity, potable water, and plumbing. \r\n\r\n His business involves transporting construction materials. He does this in his own truck, hauling earth, stone, wood, cement, and all types of materials used in construction everyday and at all hours, as required by the contractors. \u201cI have done this nearly all my life,\u201d he says, \u201cstarting as an assistant hauler, lugging sand and stones; later, I became independent and, with the help of a loan, I obtained my own truck, which is my principal work tool,\u201d he commented.\r\n\r\nThis is Rafael's first sequence of loans with this institution during the 36 years he has been developing this activity. That is why he is requesting a loan \u2013 to change the tires on his truck so that he can work with greater security.\r\n\r\nRafael's dream is to help his children to become professionals. He wants to conduct maintenance on his truck, purchasing four new tires, because the present tires are worn out and can no longer provide the necessary security for work.

This transport business is all done on the Ishaka-Mbarara highway located in southwestern Uganda. He started this business to generate his own income and an income for his now-growing family. <br \/><br \/>Apart from the transport business, he has no other source of income, since he is ever on the road transporting people from all walks of life, since these people are his main clients. <br \/><br \/>This is his first loan from UGAFODE Microfinance. He is borrowing UGX 1,000,000 to buy construction materials in the form of cement, sand, and shutters to finish construction of his family house, since he is now in a rental house.

Koibatek is known for its hilly landscape and love for dairy farming. \r\nChristine enjoys dairy farming. She and a small group of farmers joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is Kiva's field partner, to access funds and improve their livelihoods. Christine is seeking a loan to purchase barbed wire and install a fence around her property. To her, putting in a fence is very important as it sets boundaries for outsiders and controls the movement of her farm animals within the property. Due to the steep contour of her farm, the fence will ensure that the cows stay within their fairly-level grazing zones.

Nowadays, there are still traces of the indigenous culture that can be seen in the colorful traditional dresses that the women wear, the language, and some traditions. The members of the group \u201cBenem\u00e9rito\u201d are proud of their roots. They also have the good fortune of living among mountains that are covered with trees, which provide clean air to the population and a spectacular view. \r\n\r\nElvira belongs to the \u201cBenem\u00e9rito\u201d group. She is a cheerful young woman who lives with Horacio, her partner, and her 2 year-old daughter. She has been raising and selling yearling sheep for two years, when she also requested her first loan from VisionFund M\u00e9xico. Elvira decided to follow her parents\u2019 footsteps in the most common line of business in the area where she lives. She recently sold 4 animals and now needs a new loan to buy 4 more young sheep to continue with her business. \r\n\r\n\u201cI am very pleased to have my loan because it helps me to have my own business,\u201d Elvira explained. She would like to request a larger amount in the future in order to open a small store and have a continuous income. With yearling sheep sales, she can only receive income 4 months after acquiring the animals, but for her it\u2019s essential to have a little bit of money every week, and in order to achieve this, she knows she needs to make more effort.\r\n\r\nWhen talking about her dreams, Elvira explains she\u2019d like to have her own house, because for now she lives with her in-laws. She also has a dream of returning to school in order to get ahead, because she was only able to finish junior high school. \r\n\r\nThe other members of \u201cBenem\u00e9rito\u201d also have their own businesses to help their partners provide for the family expenses. Trinidad wants to invest in her grocery store; Yolanda in sewing supplies, yarns, and fabric; Elena in embroidered apron sales; Aurea and Teresa in raising young cattle; Esther in the manufacture of folders to protect documents; and Matilde in raising chickens. \r\n\r\n*In the photo: the members are in a street in the community of Mazahua.

Fancy would like to produce more milk out of her cows in the future. In order to realize her goal, she needs to ensure that the environment in which her cows are subjected to is comfortable and conducive for maximum productivity of the cows. It is for this reason that Fancy is seeking a loan to introduce cow barns at her farm.

a widow, and has one son. Shaiyrkul has secondary education. She is on a pension. To get an additional income, she has worked with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation for a period of 34 years. \r\n\r\nThanks to Shaiyrkul's persistent work and purposefulness, her farm currently consist of a plot of land of 2.59 hectares of own land, and 1.0 hectares of rented land, on which she grows alfalfa and wheat for selling. She also has eight cows on her farm. Shaiyrkul's monthly income is 11,500 som (KGS). This money is unfortunately not enough for a decent life. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, she turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase steers. Shaiyrkul plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business, which will allow her to improve the well-being of the family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":618.75,"image":{"id":1823935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase steers in order to increase her income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kichi-Oruktuu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-03-01T23:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-03-31T23:00:05Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shaiyrkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":206.25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":12618.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649514159},{"amount":206.25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":12618.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500576},{"amount":192.96,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":12618.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.29,"payment_id":752025796}],"funded_date":"2015-03-11T06:50:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":846627,"name":"William","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"William is a hardworking man living in Masindi-Uganda.

It will also help her to earn maximum profitable income to fulfill the needs of her business and family.\r\n\r\nFor this financial assistance, Shagufta is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":383.32,"image":{"id":1823734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

community for many years with the support of her husband, who is also shown in the photo. She offers a variety of grocery items at a reasonable price and has retained many customers who regularly shop at her store. Saleema makes enough to provide for her family.

He is very excited to also be purchasing a solar light, apart from fertilizer and maize, because he will now be able to have light during dark hours for his children to be able to study. With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Shitawa\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 5.25 acres of land and purchase a total of 2 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1806041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-03-02T00:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-01T00:20:07Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shitawa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peninah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorcas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josika","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melisa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Braxedis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":72720,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72720}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T11:25:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":846392,"name":"Roseline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The person in the photo is Roseline, 35, married and the mother of two children.

She's an optimistic, patient, responsible, and hardworking woman, and a good mother to her son, 10.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling traditional food.  She works in the 15 de Octubre neighborhood of the city, an area known as an informal sector and for independent manufacturing.  The climate is warm, tropical, and humid, and the air temperature varies between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade during the day throughout the year.\r\n\r\nSandra (seated in the chair) is dark with dark eyes, and she wears her long black hair tied back.  She's of robust stature and dresses fashionably.  Her native language is Guarani, which she speaks at home; she speaks Spanish for cultural reasons and for business.  She lives with her partner, who works in transportation, and her son, who attends school.  They live in a rented room built of brick and cement with a metal roof, and they have potable water, electricity, and gas.\r\n\r\nSandra's desire to increase her income by generating more sales inspired her to form a bank with people with businesses to request a loan and expand their businesses.  These include cosmetics sales, empanada sales, seasonal clothing sales, furniture sales, machine weaving, leather wallet production, making \"polleras\" [traditional skirts], \"salte\u00f1a\" [meat pie] sales, quilt sales, cookware sales, and transportation services.\r\n\r\nHer business is making and selling \"taitet\u00fa\" cracklings (fried boar), Santa Cruz-style \"locro carretero\" (stew with dehydrated meat, chopped meat, yuca, and eggs), \"remojado\" soup (bone soup), and other traditional Santa Cruz dishes.\r\n\r\nShe works every day of the week during lunch and dinner in a sales stall she sets up outside on the street under some umbrellas for protection from the sun and with a few tables and benches for seating.  \"I would like to improve my business by buying tables and benches to serve more customers, because they go away if they don't find a place to eat,\" she said.\r\n\r\nSandra's requesting a loan because she wants to expand her business with the purchase of tables, chairs, and cutlery to serve more customers and improve her sales.  This is her first loan sequence with the institution in the year she has been in this line of work.  Her dream is to have a restaurant with everything she needs to give good service.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5375,"image":{"id":1825090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables, chairs, and cutlery to serve more customers and improve her sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-02T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-01T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":5375,"lender_count":158,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Candelaria M","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Karla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":37000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":5375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3359.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3638.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3785.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3972.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4127.13},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4264.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4436.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4602.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4813.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":488},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":528.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":549.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":577.04},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":599.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":619.51},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":644.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":668.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":699.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":488,"local_amount":3359.24,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:30:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3371.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214353},{"amount":528.63,"local_amount":3638.92,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3652.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564474},{"amount":549.93,"local_amount":3785.56,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3799.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046439},{"amount":577.04,"local_amount":3972.2,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3987.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344260},{"amount":599.55,"local_amount":4127.13,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4142.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554481},{"amount":619.51,"local_amount":4264.52,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468602},{"amount":644.47,"local_amount":4436.38,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4453.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296467},{"amount":1367.87,"local_amount":9416.05,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":9451.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076710}],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T14:21:23Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":846680,"name":"Ignatius","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ignatius lives in Hoima, Uganda.

His youngest child is just two years old.  Satarbek has a specialized secondary education and he knows how to properly use and invest money to reach the goals that he has set for himself.  As the main source of income for his family, he is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture.  He started 17 years ago when he purchased his first livestock for 15,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to his very hard work, he currently has 12 sheep and three cows on his farm.  He has everything that he needs to take care of livestock: a barn as well as fields to send the animals to pasture.  He also grows watermelons on one hectare of rented land.  Satarbek has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy seeds and fertilizers to be used inside his greenhouse.  He is a member of the \"Yntymak\" group, which comprises a total of three members.  The earnings from his loan will allow Satarbek to grow his business and to save some money to buy a much needed

She has a secondary education and she has been involved in agriculture for many years.  She currently owns three cows and 30 sheep and she also grows beans on 2.5 hectares of her own land.  Her delicious organic farm products are in high demand and bring her a monthly income of about 20,000 som (KGS).

In spite of being a woman, this is no impediment for her to work in the field and raise crops.
