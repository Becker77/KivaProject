She earns a living on her own and works at the local meat products factory, where she gets a really insignificant salary. \r\n\r\nSadly, for lack of economic resources and because she had to start working at a very young age, Mediko was unable to study a professional career.  She works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing maize, nuts and laurel. She always has high-quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price.  \r\n\r\nAs the main part of Mediko's income is seasonal, she decided to start a clothing-trading business. She sought credit among local financial institutions, but her attempts were unsuccessful because of her poor living conditions. The startup program, that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses.

Thomas also decided to purchase a solar light as part of his loan, which he is very excited about, as it will allow him to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Thomas's Group will be able to receive a total of 8 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 6.5 acres.\t\t"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1806086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-03-02T03:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-01T03:20:07Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bakam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephene","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gideon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hedwig","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ezekiel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reja","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":95080,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95080}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-05T21:06:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":847684,"name":"Nueva Luz Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dos mujeres y un var\u00f3n con negocios diferentes y un objetivo en com\u00fan, incrementar el capital de trabajo de sus negocios, se unieron para solicitar el financiamiento en ADIM y as\u00ed cumplir dicho objetivo.

With the profits from this coming season, James is planning to invest in a business.\r\n\r\nA total of five acres will be planted by James's Group, and between them they will receive a total of five solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1800059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, as well as a solar light.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-03-02T05:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-01T05:00:03Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brittison","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Heldah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reuben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clinton","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Metrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maxwel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":75300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T14:39:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shali"}},{"id":846807,"name":"Nguvu Moja Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Riziki, who is in her mid-40s, is a widow with 4 children, 3 of whom are at school while the fourth is now grown.

When the chickens are ready, they are delivered to a few shops in town or sold by the pound from their home.  The pigs are butchered and the meat is sold by the pound.

However, Salvador doesn't have enough money to do so, which is why he is requesting a loan to invest in buying land. \r\n\r\nSalvador's biggest dream is to get the loan so that he can make his purchase and boost his earnings, in order to set up a banana storage facility.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300.24,"image":{"id":1825283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2015-03-02T14:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-01T14:00:05Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salvador","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":277.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.06,"local_amount":556,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:07:57Z","rounded_local_amount":573.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636134613},{"amount":37.53,"local_amount":278,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":286.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664972091},{"amount":75.06,"local_amount":556,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":573.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681267631},{"amount":37.53,"local_amount":278,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":286.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696477481},{"amount":37.53,"local_amount":278,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":286.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731215204},{"amount":37.53,"local_amount":278,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":286.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752000709}],"funded_date":"2015-03-22T06:13:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chloe Pilpel","image":1214298}},{"id":847028,"name":"Lourdes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of three children, Lourdes works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a food vending business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from a general store and raising livestock.

De hecho, otra de las caracter\u00edsticas de las integrantes, aparte de la amistad que las une, es que todas ellas se dedican a criar animales, siguiendo la tradici\u00f3n del lugar donde viven.\n\nAndrea es la l\u00edder del equipo, es una mujer sonriente pero el atributo que m\u00e1s la distingue es su amabilidad. Ella tiene 34 a\u00f1os y est\u00e1 casada con Germ\u00e1n quien se dedica a la construcci\u00f3n de casas. La pareja dio vida a 8 hijos, aunque ya s\u00f3lo 3 dependen econ\u00f3micamente de ellos.\n\nHace 4 a\u00f1os, Andrea comenz\u00f3 a criar borregos porque fue una actividad que aprendi\u00f3 gracias a sus padres, adem\u00e1s de que le permite permanecer en su casa para dedicar suficiente tiempo a su familia y a sus labores del hogar. A lo largo de este tiempo, ha podido observar cambios en su negocio \"Gracias a mi experiencia, ya puedo mantener sanos a mis animales\". Andrea recuerda que al principio los borregos se enfermaban continuamente, pero ahora cuenta con la ayuda de un veterinario de quien ha aprendido algunas pr\u00e1cticas y t\u00e9cnicas para mantener a los animales en mejores condiciones. Adem\u00e1s actualmente ya tiene un lugar bien acondicionado para los borregos, que logr\u00f3 construir con sus ganancias. Andrea necesita comprar tres borregos m\u00e1s, ya que recientemente vendi\u00f3 los que ten\u00eda y desea continuar con la actividad. \n\nAndrea, agradecida y orgullosa de sus logros comenta que el apoyo econ\u00f3mico y su esfuerzo hicieron posible tener una mejor vivienda para su familia. Recuerda que antes de comenzar a criar animales, su casa era muy peque\u00f1a y con sus 8 hijos, el espacio era insuficiente. \n\nSu gran sue\u00f1o es ver a sus 3 hijos m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os terminar alguna carrera profesional para que tengan mejores oportunidades de trabajo. \n\nAl comentar acerca de los cr\u00e9ditos, Andrea comparti\u00f3 su experiencia: ella no confiaba en ning\u00fan tipo de pr\u00e9stamo, pero uno de sus vecinos quien le inspiraba respeto y confianza, le habl\u00f3 de VisionFund M\u00e9xico y la invit\u00f3 a unirse a su grupo de pr\u00e9stamo hace 5 a\u00f1os. El vecino de Andrea falleci\u00f3 al poco tiempo, pero ella lo sigue recordando con la misma admiraci\u00f3n por el esfuerzo que dedicaba a su propia actividad y despu\u00e9s de varios ciclos, ella sigue confiando y solicitando cr\u00e9dito que representa una oportunidad para seguir mejorando.\n\n*En la imagen: Andrea es quien viste el su\u00e9ter azul y una falda roja.

The most outstanding activities of the community are growing corn and raising livestock. In fact one of the characteristics apart from the friendship that ties them together they all raise animals following the tradition of the place where they live. <br \/><br \/>Andrea is the leader of the team and she is a smiling women whose most distinguishing trait is her friendliness. She is 34 years old, is married to  Germ\u00e1n who works in building houses. The pair have given birth to 8 children although only 3 still depend on them economically. <br \/><br \/>Four years ago Andrea started to raise sheep as it was an activity sh learned from her parents. Plus it allowed her to stay at home and spend enough time for her family and her housework. Throughout this time she has noticed changes in her business. \u201cThanks to my experience I can keep my animals healthy\u201d. Andrea remembers that at the beginning her animals were always sick but now she counts on the help of a vet who has taught them certain methods and techniques to keep the animals in better condition. Also she now has a place that is suitable for the sheep which she manged to build with her profits. <br \/><br \/>Andrea needs to buy 3 more sheep as she has recently sold the ones she had and wants to continue with her business. Andrea is grateful and proud of her gains, commented that the economic support and her efforts made it possible to have a better life for her family. She recalls that before starting to raise animals her house was very small and with 8 children there was not enough room. Her great dream is to see her 3 youngest children finish professional training to have better employment opportunities. <br \/><br \/>Commenting on the loans Andrea shared her thought that she didn't trust any type of loan but one of her neighbors who she trusted and respected talked to her about  VisionFund M\u00e9xico and invited her to join a loan group 5 years ago. Andrea's neighbor died shortly after but she continued to remember her with the same admiration for the effort that she dedicated to her own business, and after several loan cycles she continues to have confidence and request loans that are her best opportunity to continue to grow. <br \/><br \/>In the photo Andrea is wearing a blue sweater and a red skirt. The members are seated at the bottom of the kiosk in the cnter of the municipality they live in, very close to the esplanade, the City hall and the Catholic church.<br \/> <br \/>."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3065.05,"image":{"id":1825288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 3 sheep, corn and fodder.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-03-02T16:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-01T16:00:10Z","loan_amount":4025,"lender_count":104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Maximina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5021.72},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4983.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5306.95},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5488.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5819.73},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6043.31},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6339.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6684.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6979.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7333.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":336.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.29},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":368.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.41},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":405.41},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":448.41},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":468.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":491.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":336.89,"local_amount":5022,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5035.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769256},{"amount":334.31,"local_amount":4983.5,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":4997.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649764014},{"amount":356.03,"local_amount":5307.26,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5321.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597539},{"amount":368.19,"local_amount":5488.6,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682140930},{"amount":390.43,"local_amount":5820.06,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:55:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5835.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768093},{"amount":398.66,"local_amount":6043.67,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:35:12Z","rounded_local_amount":6060.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.77,"payment_id":711701182},{"amount":425.33,"local_amount":6340.31,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6357.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204325},{"amount":441.92,"local_amount":6684.76,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:27:39Z","rounded_local_amount":6702.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.52,"payment_id":752291808}],"funded_date":"2015-03-10T20:44:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":845087,"name":"Cfjdt 45 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"CJFDT 45 est un sous groupe de la Convergence des Jeunes et Femmes pour le D\u00e9veloppement de Tassette (village situ\u00e9 au niveau de la r\u00e9gion de Thi\u00e8s).

Asilkan has a secondary education and has been involved in animal husbandry and farming for many years. Today, Asilkan has 1 cow, 13 sheep and 1.40 hectares of land, where she grows barley.

El grupo se ubica en una comunidad mazahua en la cual la mayor\u00eda de los habitantes se dedican al comercio. Otra peculiaridad del lugar es que los mismos comerciantes salen a vender a ciudades distantes, dejando su hogar durante una semana, 15 d\u00edas o hasta un mes completo. Los ni\u00f1os quedan al cuidado de los hermanos mayores o de sus abuelos. \n\nMaricela forma parte de Rayito de Sol, tiene 19 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada con Eduardo y tiene una beb\u00e9. Los padres de Maricela siempre se han dedicado al comercio y de ellos aprendi\u00f3 la actividad. Desde hace 2 a\u00f1os, se ha dedicado a vender vasos y cuchillas para licuadora junto con su esposo aunque \u00e9l es quien sale durante periodos largos para llegar a los lugares m\u00e1s lejanos, mientras que Maricela visita s\u00f3lo las comunidades m\u00e1s cercanas para no descuidar a su peque\u00f1a.\n\nComo buenos comerciantes, Maricela y Eduardo e incluso los dem\u00e1s habitantes de la comunidad, siempre est\u00e1n al d\u00eda ofreciendo el tipo de mercanc\u00eda que m\u00e1s compran las personas. Por temporadas tambi\u00e9n han llegado a vender almohadas y controles de televisi\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s, Maricela tambi\u00e9n cr\u00eda y vende pollos y vende los huevos de sus gallinas para tener un ingreso extra. Los animales o huevos que no llega a vender, afortunadamente los puede ocupar para su propio consumo.\n\nHasta ahora, la pareja no ha probado establecer su negocio en un local. Para ellos es m\u00e1s com\u00fan caminar entre las calles o entre mercados para vender sus productos. Sin embargo, Maricela est\u00e1 agradecida ya que los pr\u00e9stamos han promovido un cambio positivo en su vida: ahora tiene m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda para vender y siempre cuenta con suficiente dinero para cubrir sus necesidades. Recuerda que antes ped\u00eda prestado con sus vecinos para poder comprar hasta los alimentos m\u00e1s b\u00e1sicos y que esta acci\u00f3n era muy recurrente. Por fin, Maricela ha dejado esta pr\u00e1ctica s\u00f3lo en su memoria. Aun m\u00e1s importante para ella, fue que despu\u00e9s del nacimiento complicado de su hija, contaba con el dinero suficiente para pagar un tratamiento en un hospital particular y que afortunadamente despu\u00e9s de varios d\u00edas de angustia en la familia, la ni\u00f1a pudo ir a casa sin mayor problema.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de d\u00edas dif\u00edciles y grandes retos, Maricela sigue so\u00f1ando con volver a la escuela y con tener una casa propia para su familia; sabe que lo lograr\u00e1 con su empe\u00f1o y dando continuidad a sus actividades.\n\n*En la imagen: las integrantes al pie del quiosco en el centro del municipio donde viven.

The group is located in a Mazahua community in which the majority of inhabitants are in commerce. Another notable characteristic is that these businesspeople go off to sell in distant cities, leaving their home for a week or two or a whole month. The children stay in the care of their older siblings or grandparents. <br \/><br \/>Maricela is part of the Rayito de Sol group. She is 19 years old, married with Eduardo and has a baby. Maricela's parents have always worked in commerce and she learned from them. For the past 2 years she has been selling glass containers and blades for blenders. She works with her husband although it is him that leaves for long periods to travel to distant places while Maricela only visits the closer communities so that she can take care of her child. As good merchants Maricela and Eduardo along with the other inhabitants keep up to date offering the merchandise bought most by people. At times they have also sold pillows and tv remotes. <br \/><br \/>Maricela also raises and sells chickens and sells their eggs to have another income. The ones they can't sell fortunately can be used for their own consumption. Up to now the couple have not tried to have s tore in their community. For them it is more common to go through the streets and markets to sell their products. However Maricela is grateful that the loan have made a positive change in their lives as now they always have enough merchandise to sell and always have enough money to cover their needs. She remembers before, asking for loans from neighbors to be able to buy the most basic food and that this occurred often. <br \/><br \/>Now Maricela has left this practice in her memory. Still more important to her that after a difficult birth of her daughter she still had enough money to pay for treatment in a private hospital. Fortunately after a number of agonizing days for the family the child was able to go home with no further problems. After difficult days and challenges. Maricela continues to dream of returning to school and of having their own house for the family. She knows that she can achieve this with effort and continue her activities. <br \/><br \/>In the photo the members are at the foot of the bandstand in the centre of the municipality where they live, close to City hall and the Catholic church. Maricela is wearing a white sweater and has her hand close to her face."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6025,"image":{"id":1825290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy glass container and blades for blenders.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-03-02T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-01T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":6025,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eufemia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":11250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":753.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":753.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":753.13},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":753.13},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":753.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":753.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":753.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":753.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2259.39,"local_amount":33750,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":33771.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769257},{"amount":1506.25,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":22514.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649764015},{"amount":1506.24,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":22514.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597540},{"amount":753.12,"local_amount":11250,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":11257.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682140931}],"funded_date":"2015-03-02T23:14:57Z","paid_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":847059,"name":"Merlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlinda is 39 years old and married with two children.<br \/><br \/>Merlinda works hard to provide for her family.

They always support each other in difficult situations, but together they also enjoy the celebrations of the town, including the next carnival that will come in March.\r\n\r\nMa Luisa is the leader of the group.

All of children continue studying, fortunately.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, Mary\u2014as they call her affectionately\u2014started her own business. Very emotionally, she said that she has always loved cooking, and for this reason, she decided to make pastries to sell. Previously, she worked in a restaurant, and it was there where she gained experience, which also contributed to motivate her to start her business.\r\n\r\nMary makes desserts, including gelatin, cookies, cakes, and flans to sell to her relatives, friends, and acquaintances. She says that she is very happy and thankful for VisionFund because thanks to the loans, she has been able to start her business. With this help, she has been able to pay for her household experience and for the education of her children. Now, she needs to buy supplies, such as flour, eggs, milk, and butter to continue baking and selling based on orders or door-to-door.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that on occasion, the sales of desserts are low, the earnings are still a big benefit for her and her family. One of her dreams is to buy land and to begin building. She says that she would love to have her own house and to give her children an estate.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Zujey, who will invest in undergarments, sheep, chickens, and turkeys; Bertha and Lilia, who will invest in undergarments; Felipa, who will invest in a grocery store; Magdalena who will invest in cosmetics and fabric; and Juana who will invest in jewelry and cosmetics.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken outside the home of Lilia, who is one of the members.

She is married to Jaime, a van operator, and has four children, two of whom are already in high school; the other two are working. She manages their household while operating her business to augment their income and provide for the needs of her family.<br \/><br \/>Marietta runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. Marietta is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are very much cheaper compared with brand new clothes sold in malls.  <br \/><br \/>Marietta earns a minimum of 900 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. To help her expand the business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan to buy additional slightly used but quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, and used bags and footwear as well. She is encouraged by a good return on her investment and is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her, for it will surely help fund their everyday needs and for the school needs of her children.<br \/><br \/>Marietta dreams to have her own space in a commercial building to attract and serve more customers. She aims to send her children to college and see them become professionals. She meets up every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1824471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to pay for slightly used or surplus clothing to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-03-02T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-01T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marietta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":190.02,"local_amount":7999.98,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":8390.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187125},{"amount":95.01,"local_amount":3999.99,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4194.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536152},{"amount":126.64,"local_amount":5333.32,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5593.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017369},{"amount":63.33,"local_amount":2666.71,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2796.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313793}],"funded_date":"2015-03-02T20:28:42Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":847112,"name":"Anita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anita is 51 years old and married with four children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by raising pigs in the Philippines.

Ogulhon has specialized secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, she has been involved in agriculture for 25 years, having started this business with a purchase of one cow. Today, Ogulhon's farm contains 3 cows and 12 sheep. She grows peas and corn for sale on her land plot. Thanks to Ogulhon's hard work, her business yields about 20,000 som (KGS) per month; however, this money is catastrophically insufficient to support the family. In order to further develop her business, Ogulhon requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy livestock.

Here is his story:<br \/><br \/>\u201cOne day I went to meet my friend, who studied at AUCA. As she was late, I went to the Admissions Office of this university and learnt about how to be admitted and what departments they had. When I heard the tuition fee, I was surprised, as it was too much for my family and unaffordable for us, so I shared my family\u2019s financial situation with them. They suggested I go to the New Generation Academy, a one-year Preparation Program at AUCA. I was too surprised again when I was told about 70 full Scholarships to study there. In fact, they supported children from poor families from the villages of Kyrgyzstan. I thought that I was blessed by God and should try it. In the 11th form I learnt English very hard and set an aim to be admitted at New Generation Academy at AUCA. My dream came true and I had a chance not only to study for free there, but also to live and have meals for free there. My next step was to get ready for the AUCA Entrance Exams, and God blessed me here too. <br \/><br \/>There are eight people in my family: my parents, my two elder and one younger brother, one elder and one younger sister, and me. My elder brother and sister have their own families and live separate from us. My younger brother has had epilepsy from 2010. Last year he wanted to enter the university. Unfortunately, due to the lack of money, he couldn\u2019t do it. My parents are farmers; we grow fruits and vegetables and sell them at the local market in my town. My father is 68 and my mother is 67, and they do their best to support us, even though they are retired. As my second brother studies at another university and we rent a room in Bishkek, we are always short of money. My parents try to earn additional money to send us, but they are not always successful. We buy food at the market and walk to the university in order to save money somehow. We always feel how my parents try the damnedest to treat my sick brother and to pay for my and my other brother\u2019s tuition fee. I hope to get a Degree and help my family make its life simpler. The Kiva loan will be of great help for me. I am requesting this loan to pay university costs for my degree, which will allow me to keep fighting to grow every day.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1824445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She works hard each day and she is pretty sure enough that she is closer to reaching her goals.\r\n\r\nDelsa owns a variety store. She believes that business is her stepping stone of making her dreams come to happen. She knows how important it is for her neighbors and daily consumers to have a nearby store where they can buy a sachet of shampoo, a bar of soap, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, an egg, toothpaste, or even ice tubes. She gets her product from a wholesaler at a lower price and then she will sell it per piece for a higher price to have profit.\r\n\r\nShe desires to manage a bigger store someday so she is requesting a PHP 9,000 loan which she will use to buy additional groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She is positive that she will become a successful businesswoman in the future and and she looks forward to seeing her children finish their studies through all her hard work and perseverance.\r\n\r\nDelsa meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her life and business every week, and here she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She works as an assistant of a construction engineer. Her parents recently give her a piece of land where she can start building her own house. She has been saving for the last months so she can start the construction and now she is asking for a loan to complete the money she needs to buy the materials for the foundations and the walls of her new home. Maria del Carmen is excited to start a dream house and to give her family a house that can last a lifetime. She also feels proud of what her work can contribute to the well being of the people she loves the most. Maria del Carmen makes around $400 USD a month.

Madnur is a civil servant. <br \/><br \/>He joined Ruma in 2013. At first, he knew about Ruma from one of his friends who already had become a Ruma agent. Then, because he was getting curious about Ruma, he came by himself to one of Ruma\u2019s branches near his house. After he got a complete explanation about Ruma from Ruma field staff, he was interested to join Ruma. He decided to join Ruma because he wants to learn about how to become an entrepreneur. <br \/><br \/>Now, he owns a small stall where he provides mobile payment services for his community. His community sees him as a trusted, friendly and informative mobile payment service provider. <br \/><br \/>With assistance and support from Ruma\u2019s staff, Madnur sees improvements in his business. As the business grows, he is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the loan to provide more mobile payment services for his community.

In total, her activity brings her about 10,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further grow her farming business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS).

He earns his living selling cattle.\r\n\r\nHe is enterprising, hardworking, has a good attitude, is committed to his work, and responsible. His farm is located in the community of Huayrocondo, about 60 km from the city. When you pass the community on the highway, it doesn\u2019t seem at all large, but that changes once you get to know it. \r\n\r\nIn front are enormous open plains with mountains protected by the Cordillera Real and strong winds. The inhabitants of the three ecological zones of this municipality are trying to write a new chapter through their work as cattle breeders and producers. The climate is cold and dry, with a daily temperature that ranges between 2 and 16C.\r\n\r\nArsenio has a dark complexion, short black hair, dark eyes, and is of medium build. His native language is Aymara which he speaks at home, but he also speaks Spanish for cultural and business purposes. He lives with his parents who are older and no longer work. They live in a brick house with a metal-sheet roof; they get water from a well and have electricity.\r\n\r\nArsenio sells cattle and he keeps an eye open for milk cows, calves and other animals in the different markets in the area. He then raises, fattens, and sells them. It\u2019s a job he\u2019s been doing his whole life, first of all assisting his father, and now independently. He notes that cattle markets begin very early in the morning, sometimes before the sun rises. He says he is well known in the various markets, and he has regular customers because they know he has worked in the business for his whole life. Arsenio\u2019s dream is to have a large number of well-cared for animals. He wishes to move into dairy farming so he wants to buy milk cows to raise, fatten, and finally sell. This is the first loan he\u2019s had with this institution in the five years he has been working independently.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons Arsenio is seeking a loan to buy dairy cows and begin his new business venture.\r\n\u2028"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":412.7,"image":{"id":1825821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy
