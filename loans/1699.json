Her husband has been working in a public sector organization for many years, and he is responsible for providing for the needs of the family. Abida also provides sewing services and earns some income to contribute to the household expenses along with her husband.\r\n \r\nAbida now needs different kinds of goods such as needles, threads, pieces of cloth, machine oil, etc. for her business, but due to insufficient financial means she is unable to purchase these accessories. Therefore she has applied for a Kiva loan from Kiva's field partner, BRAC Pakistan, to enable her to purchase the above accessories. This loan will help her to increase her monthly sales and profit by providing better sewing services.\r\n\r\nAbida is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

Her business is carried out as a street vendor in the city, which is located in a valley with fertile and productive land at 2571 meters above sea level, surrounded by fields of crops and valuable pre-Incan and Incan vestiges. It keeps its viceregal personality, has a dry and template climate where the winter temperatures don't go below 10\u00b0 centigrade and in the summer, don't go above 30\u00b0 centigrade. It is currently the third city in economic importance in the country. \r\n\r\nErika has dark skin, long black hair, which she keeps tied up, dark eyes, is short, has a robust physique, her native language is Quechua which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and the work she does (she is the third from the left, with a purple sweater and a scarf around her neck). Her need to help her family generate more economic income to satisfy the needs of her girl brought her to form a bank of people with business such as quilts, appliance repair shop, transportation service, newspaper sales, meat pie sales, book store, and second-hand clothing sales, to ask for a loan and improve their businesses. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling traditional dishes and in this city they are used to a menu depending on the day such as Monday: Aj\u00ed de flores de chilijchi (ceibo flowers sauteed with onion, tomato and green peppers, and white potatoes), Tuesday: Conejo lambreado (breaded and fried guinea pig and topped with french fries and beef and with garnishes of freeze-dried p'uti potatoes and white potatoes), Wednesday: Chajchu (filets of beef, green onion, tender broad beans, chopped freeze-dried potatoes, slices of boiled egg, a sauce of julienned onions, tomatoes and green peppers, and covered in red chili), Thursdays: chanka de conejo (tender guinea pig cooked and flavored with mint, green onion, tender broad beans, white potatoes, and green pepper llajua hot sauce; it is also prepared with chicken), Friday: pork rinds (cooked in a clay pot in its own lard, with boiled white corn and green pepper llajua hot sauce), Saturday: fidius uch\u00fa (noodle chili with a thick stew, cows tails, freeze-dried potato and potato), and Sunday: phampaku (a valley version of the slow-cooked flavored dish of duck, piglet, lamb, chicken and brisket; it is served with potatoes and baked plantains and salads). \"Traditional dishes are largely inherited and pass from generation to generation. There isn't any cooking school that teaches what we cook...\" she says. Her dream is to give her girl a better future, she wants to purchase a cart with wheels to transport her pots, plates, benches for seating, umbrella, and more, to be able to move to different places in the city and get more customers.

The couple have two daughters who currently attent preschool. \r\nThree years ago, Lucia started to take charge of a small grocery shop. When she got married and had a family, she knew she had to help her husband with household expenses, but she didn\u2019t want to go out and not take care of her family. Lucia, active as always, also felt the need to do something more besides household chores. An acquaintance of Antonio offered them the opportunity to let them take over his shop, and the couple saw it as a perfect option so that Lucia would have another occupation. \r\nHowever, they did not have the money to purchase all of the merchandise which was already in the store, their savings were not enough, and that is how they approached VisionFund Mexico. Fortunately, they accumulated the capital to achieve their goal, and with time, the small shop that at the beginning was located in another street in the same community, was also installed in their home. \r\nLucia is very grateful for the loans, as they have not only allowed her to start her business, but cycle after cycle she can stock up on cookies, sodas, juices, rice, and beans, among other products. Also, the profit helped her to start breeding and selling chickens, and therefore have more money for the family. Lucia perceives a change in her live: she has her own income and she can invest it again in her business and help out by paying some of the expenses of her daughters. Currently, she does not need to take money from her husband\u2019s income to maintain her occupation, and this makes her feel fulfilled. \r\nWhen facing the challenge of competition, Lucia keeps showing her happiness and optimism as always: \u201cI always look forward\u201d, she says, as when she sees so many shops in the same community, it pushes her to have a larger variety of products in her own. Her goal is to start selling cold meats very soon, which is why she will need a large fridge.\r\nThe other members of the group will also take advantage of the opportunity of economic assistance to invest in their activities. Ofelia will invest in her own grocery shop; Nancy, breeding sheep; Alejandro, breeding calves; and Susana and Rosalia, breeding chickens. \r\n\r\n*In the picture, the members are in the main plaza of the municipality where they live, when during festive days, there is a fair. Very nearby is city hall, a fountain, a kiosk, and a catholic church which give a great view to the municipality. Lucia wears a black jacket with white stripes.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3025,"image":{"id":1825965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cookies, drinks, juices, rice, and beans.

The startup program, which is joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program. Roini plans to sell the pigs at a good price at the local market and earn more significant income than he has been earning. He hopes to see his family's living conditions improve and to more effectively meet daily costs. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1824684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase pigs ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Teklati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2015-03-03T14:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-02T14:20:05Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roini","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.21},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.14},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.18},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.31},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.41},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.9},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.59},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.17},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.3},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.77},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.28},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.53},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.14},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.34},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.49},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.2},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.92},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.37},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.51},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.96},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.28,"local_amount":54.78,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":57.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636277395},{"amount":574.72,"local_amount":1245.22,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1297.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649613406}],"funded_date":"2015-03-21T14:25:47Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T13:56:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":847346,"name":"Hamda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hamda is a 47-year-old married mother of six children.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She lives alone and earns a living with only an age pension that she gets from the local government. It's hardly enough for Leila to meet all basic needs and daily expenses. <br \/><br \/>Leila has requested a Credo loan for the start-up of a trading business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

His wife is also a farmer. \r\n\r\nWith the loan from Kiva, he would like to pay his workers. The profits from the business will be used to pay more workers.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

is a 29 year old refugee. He is divorced and has a daughter and two sons. He lives with his children and parents in Bilasuvar IDP settlement and takes care of his family. His father helps with earnings, working as a bus driver but their main income comes from husbandry. Shahin keeps sheep.  He raises them, fattens them and then sells the meat to local cafes, restaurants and bazaars. He also sells wool at the local bazaar too.

PALMIS En\u00e8ji is a social business initiated by French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde. It provides vulnerable households suffering from energy poverty with clean, modern and affordable cooking and lighing solutions. PE's range of solar lights, solar home systems and clean cookstoves have been designed to maximize health, economic and social impacts for users: less noxious emissions inhalated by women and their children while cooking, less money spent on charcoal and kerosene, less trees cut to produce charcoal, brighter and more comfortable homes. More than 12,000 households have already benefited from these products since 2013. PALMIS En\u00e8ji partners with local microentrepreneurs such as Marie-Waseline (picture) in order to distribute its products in the poorest communities of Haiti. Its network of franchised entrepreneurs brings together more than 50 resellers who generate an extra income from the sale of solar lights and improved cookstoves. In order to scale-up its activities and support more entrepreneurs such as Marie-Waseline, PALMIS En\u00e8ji is seeking 49,950 USD in working capital, which will be used to import and stock clean energy products to meet customer demand.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

They always seek the merchandise that is in highest demand depending upon the season, and they sometimes travel to other cites leaving their homes for weeks, sometimes a month at a time. The name they chose for themselves is of biblical origin, and means \u201cunity\u201d.\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica is a happy and responsible woman. She is 32 years old, and married to Enrique. Ang\u00e9lica is the mother of three children. Two of them are already in school, while the youngest is not yet of school age. She learned how to be a business person thanks to her parents. From a very early age, she watched them as they arranged merchandise and prepared to go out and sell it. The products that are sold the most are remote controls for electronic devices, and in the winter, socks and clothing.\r\n\r\nShe currently still sells her merchandise walking along the streets, in small markets and in the squares of neighboring communities. For Ang\u00e9lica, settling in one place to sell her products is not an option. She has always preferred going to her customers rather than waiting for them to come to her, since she\u2019s used to it this way.\r\n\r\nTraveling vendors like Ang\u00e9lica face difficulties caused by weather and authorities who do not permit them to sell their wares freely in some places, or demand that they pay fees. They also face periods of low sales, which they know well how to anticipate. The next four months will be a bit difficult for Ang\u00e9lica, nonetheless, she needs to prepare herself and buy more remote controls in order to keep selling and earn some small amount of income for her family.\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica is very grateful for the loans, which have helped her invest in merchandise and increase her earnings. With her savings, she has been able to make improvements on her house. She continues to dream of being able to grow her business. She\u2019d also like to be able to offer employment to more people in her community so that they can help her sell her merchandise in places she has yet to reach, or help her cover her routes more easily. In the picture, the members of the group are seated at the foot of the kiosk in the center of the town where they live. Nearby are a fountain, the governmental palace and the Catholic church.

He is married and has 4 children. He comes to Arvand for the first time, after finding out that there was an opportunity to receive financial support. Abdirasul lives with his family in a rural area. He does not have a college education because he did not have an opportunity to study at a university due to financial difficulties in his family. Abdirasul's wife also does not have education and is a homemaker; she is involved in house work and raising the children.\r\n\r\nTo provide income and support his family, Abdirasul is involved in his own business. He is involved in fattening up and selling cattle. He earns a good income from this business. His wife also helps him with the business. She sells milk obtained from the livestock. Now Abdirasul wants to increase his livestock quantities in order to expand his business. This is why he came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy livestock. Abdirasul really hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand for the support in advance.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250.89,"image":{"id":1820108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock in order to expand his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Rudaki","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.133333 68.958333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-03-03T23:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-02T23:20:05Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdirasul ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":350,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":24.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":26.43},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":26.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":27.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":27.29},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":28.94},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":29.89},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":31.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":32.42},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":35.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.41},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.22},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.89},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.29},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.42},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50.84,"local_amount":50.84,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":50.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636635079},{"amount":26.8,"local_amount":26.8,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":26.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649616415},{"amount":27.22,"local_amount":27.22,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":27.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666524444},{"amount":27.29,"local_amount":27.29,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:17:50Z","rounded_local_amount":27.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681394719},{"amount":28.94,"local_amount":28.94,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-23T12:11:40Z","rounded_local_amount":28.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696605025},{"amount":29.14,"local_amount":29.14,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":29.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711524534},{"amount":60.66,"local_amount":60.66,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:14:19Z","rounded_local_amount":60.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755520045}],"funded_date":"2015-03-18T08:30:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":847567,"name":"Cendrine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cendrine is 35 years old.

He is married and has one child. He comes to Arvand for the first time, upon finding out that there was an opportunity to receive financial support. Azamjon lives with his family in a rural area. He does not have a college education because he did not have an opportunity to study at a university due to financial difficulties in his family. Azamjon's wife also does not have education and is a homemaker; she is involved in house work and raising the children. To provide income and support his family, Azamjon is involved in his own business. He is involved in fattening up and selling cattle. Azamjon also works part-time as a contractor.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She does not have children. She has a business selling cheese.  Elvira is an enterprising, independent, reliable, kind, responsible, and hardworking person.  She is developing her business in the town of El Torno in a rural area known for its clusters of farmers who produce meat, milk, vegetables, grains, etc., and also for its wholesale distributors who transport these products to the various markets in the city.  This area has a warm tropical climate that is very humid.  The temperature remains at about 30 degrees centigrade throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nElvira has a dark complexion, long black hair that she wears pulled back, dark eyes, a short stature, and a robust physique. Her native language is Guarani and she also speaks Spanish in her daily life and in her business.  In the photo, she is the one seated in the chair.  She shares her life with her husband, who is a farmer.  They live in their own home, which is made of brick and has a metal roof.  Their house has electricity and well water.\r\n\r\nElvira's desire to improve her business led her to form a communal bank with others who have businesses such as: neighborhood store, meat sales, breakfast sales, moto-taxi transportation services, quinoa sales, trinket sales, and food sales, so that they could request a loan and prosper with their businesses.  Elvira has a business selling cheese.  She buys cheese at wholesale from the nearby producers to sell at retail, by unit and by weight.  She does this work every day of the week, and she works from place to place pushing a 2-wheeled cart loaded with cheese and a scale.  \r\n\r\n\"One can eat cheese at any time of day, for breakfast, in soup at lunch, at tea with bread, or by itself, and also to accompany a dinner.  I look for my customers pushing my cart, and I have regular customers who make daily orders with me,\" she comments. \r\n\r\nElvira's dream is to have a store where she could sell a greater quantity of cheese.  She wants to buy a variety of cheese to increase the products she has for sale and generate more sales.  This is her second loan cycle with the institution in the 7 years that she has been developing her business.  These are the reasons why Elvira is requesting a loan: to buy a variety of cheeses at wholesale to expand her sales so that she can get a store.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":1826064,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a variety of cheese at wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-04T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-03T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":3350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2118.16},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2156.71},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2195.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2235.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2276.61},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2318.06},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2360.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2403.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2440.53},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2494.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":314.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":319.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.47},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":363.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1268.16,"local_amount":8706.75,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":8762.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214359},{"amount":669.22,"local_amount":4594.67,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4624.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564483},{"amount":693.81,"local_amount":4763.45,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4793.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046448},{"amount":718.81,"local_amount":4935.13,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4966.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344269}],"funded_date":"2015-03-04T06:08:04Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":847748,"name":"Juanita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of seven children, Juanita works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nJuanita has a charcoal retailing business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from tricycle passengers.

She lives in a rural area and raises livestock.  She also makes and sells dairy products.  She became involved in animal husbandry after she got married and in order to help her husband provide for the family.  Over time, Munavvar gradually expanded her business and, after a few years, her herd comprised six head of cattle.  Soon, her business became the family's main source of income.  Munavvar's husband grows crops.  The children work in Russia and help their parents by sending money home every month.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Munavvar's business is currently in decline because of the political situation.  The reason for this lies in falling prices and a reduced demand for livestock.  Faced with this problem, Munavvar has decided to turn to MDO Arvand to receive some financial support.

She makes a living selling snacks. She is a good mother, kind, cheerful, generous, responsible and hard-working. Her business is located in \"plan 3000\", an area known for the amount of immigrants, such as native tribes and miners coming from the West. These groups colonized the area and the following generation started a life of trading and manufacturing. The area has tropical weather, warm and humid, with temperatures varying between 18 and 35\u00baC.\r\n\r\nManuela has tanned skin, long dark hair in a pony tail, dark eyes, short height and robust complexity. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she uses with her family. She also speaks Spanish for general culture and to be used in her business. She is the forth one in the picture from the right, and wears a white polo and blue jeans. Her wish of self-improvement and the need to feed her children led her to put together a group of people in different businesses, such as sodas, phone cards, natural juices, women t-shirts, dry fruits, school material, food and hardware products, to request a loan and expand their activities. She sells snacks, such as cold meat, tomato or chicken sandwiches, something that she does twice a day, in the morning and in the afternoon. She spends the rest of the time cooking for her family and taking care of the kids. \"I found a market niche that was not covered and started selling in the streets; I already have daily orders and deliver the food in 2 shifts\", she says. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own store to prepare the snacks and send out orders for delivery. She wants to buy ingredients, such as ham, chicken, eggs and others in bulk to be refrigerated and keep cooking all the time.

Inici\u00f3 su actividad productiva con el fin de ayudar en su hogar con los gastos, debido a que la zona en la que viven es muy rural y las fuentes de empleo son m\u00ednimas. Su compa\u00f1ero  es jornalero y lo que percibe es muy poco, entonces ella tuvo la necesidad de generar ingresos y poder ayudar a su familia.

Ella va invertir en comprar bolsas y qu\u00edmicos que necesita la siembra del pl\u00e1tano para darl mejor calidad a su producto.

Junto con Marleni trabajan  nueve socias m\u00e1s, las cuales van a invertir en agricultura y comercio.","en":"Marleni is 23 years old and has a partner and two children. Humble, simple and hard-working, Marleni is a member of the \u201cMujer Cab\u00e9car\u201d (\u201cCab\u00e9car Woman\u201d in English) communal bank. The members chose this name as they are all indigenous Cab\u00e9car women.\r\n\r\nMarleni learned about Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer from other borrowers in her community. \r\n\r\nMarleni started working growing plantains in order to help with household costs. She lives in a very rural area and employment opportunities are scant. Marleni\u2019s partner is a labourer and earns very little money. Marleni therefore had to earn an income and support her family.\r\n\r\nMarleni does not have her own family on her mother\u2019s or father\u2019s side and so takes solace in her partner\u2019s family.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Marleni has applied for a loan to strengthen her business. She will invest this loan in bags and chemicals that she needs to grow bananas. This will increase the quality of her product.\r\n\r\nOne of Marleni\u2019s goals is for her children to be able to study. She herself could not study as she had to work hard to move forward with her family, to grow, and to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nMarleni works with nine other borrowers, who will invest in farming and trade work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2825,"image":{"id":1823299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded
