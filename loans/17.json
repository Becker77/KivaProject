Palma, which is on the outskirts of Hato Mayor. Nieves lives with her husband and 15-year-old daughter in a small home. She started a small business two years ago selling homemaD. food to her community members. She is requesting a loan so that she can buy more flour, oil, plantains, and chicken. Nieves operates her own `fritura,\u00b4 a small business that makes homemaD. snacks, such as empanadas.  In the Dominican Republic, it is very common for people to buy a snack on the street corner as they walk to work, their homes, or simply when they are out and about. The money from this loan will help Nieves to buy enough ingredients to make the food necessary to meet the demands she faces. She hopes that her business will continue to grow and become more stable with the help of this loan.  The profits she makes will enable her to better proviD. for her family.  On behalf of everyone here at Esperanza International, and from Nieves herself, we thank you for your support with this micro loan!\r\n\r\nThe loan will also help fund the businesses of the other group members. \r\n\r\nAbout Group Loans: In a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan but is part of a group of individuals bound by a group guarantee.

She chose this work because she saw a good development opportunity for her family.  She began with one cow, but now has three.  Every day she goes out in the morning to take her cattle out to graze.  She also benefits from their milk, which she sells every day. Isabel's cows eat a daily diet of alfalfa, which Isabel harvests from her own fields.

This is a small settlement around one of the many sugar cane fields in La Romana. The sugar cane fields are owned by a private company, who also owns the houses in the batey and has some control over the commercial activities allowed inside the batey. This forces many of the batey inhabitants to leave their home and their children for extended periods of time to sell their goods. \r\n\r\nMariluz M., the group coordinator, has 3 children (ages 11, 9 and 4). She sells two different things: candy and snacks, which she sells from a palatera (a small market stand) and chorizo (a type of sausage). This loan, which is Mariluz's very first loan with Esperanza, will allow her to purchase merchandise for both of her sales. \r\n\r\nHowever, Mariluz does not intend to remain a seller. She intends to learn beauty culture and open a beauty salon in the near future.

She is 48 years old and for the past 20 years she has run a small home-based grocery store.  She has accomplished this with the help of her husband and with financing from Afodenic, which has allowed her to invest in a variety of merchandise.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a construction worker.  They have five children, three of them are adults and two are students.  Her earnings have allowed her to make improvements to their home.

She has tried many things to improve her family's economic stability; she previously sold clothing, but had many difficulties and was not able to spend much time with her family. Because she did not have much money, she decided to invest her savings in supplies and sell them to her neighbours. Little by little her store has been growing, and although she does not have many products she continues working to expand her inventory. She sells rice, sugar, oil, etc. \r\nWith the requested loan, she wants to buy supplies such as rice, sugar and oils for her store.

to raise children and to take care of their needs every day. At home, she is accompanied by a nephew and niece. She makes them feel loved and is helping in making their lives comfortable. In a way, she feels as though she is the real mother of her loving nephew and niece. From them, she draws out strength and determination to work hard and improve their standard of living. Nevertheless, Elenie still looks forward to having her own family in the future. But, meanwhile, she wants to be financially stable. \r\n\r\nTo be able to reach her dream of having a stable source of income to support her above-mentioned aspirations, she joined ASHI in 2003. Loans made to her since then until the present have enabled her to start raising hogs and buying and selling them as a business. All throughout her membership, Elenie has never been a problem for her co-members in terms of payment. \r\n\r\nShe believes that fate has been good to her without giving her a hard time to manage her business. After four months of raising her hogs, she sells them either alive or slaughtered to people in her village and sometimes in the market. Along with that, she also buys different commodities for selling. \r\n\r\nElenie enjoys spending the small profit she earns through the business to give her niece and nephew necessary things. However, thinking about a better kind of house to comfort and shelter her and the children she is taking care of, the urge to grow her business further becomes so intense. Because of that, she is requesting a much larger amount of loan for the financial capital growing her business requires.

Gladys is the mother of two responsible daughters and struggles in life to provide them with a good education.  She has made sacrifices to operate her modest business, but it has been profitable.  Gladys started selling hamburgers two years ago and has obtained good results.  For this reason, she was motivated to apply for a loan in order to buy a larger food cart so that she could prepare more hamburgers in less time and make her customers feel comfortable.  Being a woman entrepreneur, Gladys values the effort she puts into the work she performs every day from 6pm to midnight.  Her daily routine enables her daughters to have a decent education.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She lives with her husband and their children in her own house. Since she was very young she has been working in the fields, and with time she has turned her work into an indispensible source of income. Thus she works every day and into the night, driving out to the fields to look after them. She also keeps animals, including sheep, cows and pigs, which she takes to the fields for pasture. She works alongside her whole family, and when her husband is involved, between them they are assured of having the income to support their family. Rayda is very satisfied at their continuing progress. She has decided to further improve their crop with better seed, however, because although the harvest so far has repaid the work they put in, there is always the risk of losing a harvest through bad weather. This is her first loan from [field partner] MFP. She is very happy in the knowledge that she can access such financial support, and is grateful to be part of her communal bank because all the members are responsible people who will stick together. She is also grateful to the lenders who will come forward to offer the money she is looking for, because it will be very useful in progressing her work. The loan she is seeking will be invested in buying sacks of fertilizer, and in employing casual labourers to help till the earth for the next planting."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":723201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

In spite of this, he continues to get ahead in life and care for his 4 children who live in their own home in the town of Uni\u00f3n Palomar (in the central Peruvian jungle).  \"Constant work\" is Eugenio's motto since he has been working tenaciously in the field of agriculture for 40 years.

As his coffee harvest takes place once a year, Eugenio hires staff to support him in extracting his beans.  What he most likes about his work is the determination and effort that he puts in which is clearly reflected when he harvests and sells all of his crops.  A little while ago, he used his profits to open a grocery store where he sells essentials.  This makes him daily profits.

She began in 1998 when one of her brothers started a business selling \"gorditas de ma\u00edz\" [corn flour biscuits] near the local university; the business was very successful. As Martha was then helping her brother with his business, he encouraged her to establish her own business in another neighborhood.  She did so, and since then it also has been successful, seeing she has established two selling points in different parts of the city.  Since receiving her previous loan from Kiva, Martha has been able to open a third \"gorditas de ma\u00edz\" selling point in the specially adapted courtyard of her home.  This also has been successful.\r\n\r\nMartha needs a loan of $575 -- which she will pay back in 5 months -- to purchase basic ingredients for making the \"gorditas de ma\u00edz\" she sells.  This will keep her loyal clients happy.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Todd M.

She sells candy and snacks from a 3-wheeled cart. She offers a wide variety of cookies, candies, soft drinks, etc. She has been doing this work for thirty years in order to be able to cover her living expenses. She really enjoys it, and it is her only form of entertainment. It makes her very happy to interact with the people who buy from her, especially the children. The hardest part of her work is that she has to stay seated in one place almost all day while she sells her merchandise, but she has gotten used to this and stays focused on all of the positive things that her work brings her.

This is 30 year old Latifa K. from Mbarali. She is married with 2 children, between the ages of 7 and 13. Latifa has been running a beauty salon since 2007. Hair, hair and more hair! This is the place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or plaited, and made to look like your own.\n\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by 1 employee. Latifa currently earns about 300USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 475 USD in order to purchase cosmetics and makeup for her salon. In the future, she plans to to start a new business. Latifa thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":271538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

They live together in the town of Santa Rosa, located in the beautiful Ayacuchan jungle, where they have their own adobe house. In spite of not having gone to school due to her economic situation, this was not an excuse to not do anything.  Since then she sells cocoa, and with time this product had a lot of demand on the national and international level.  Today she sells to big wholesalers, and she feels happy because she comes crossing and doesn't regret for having bet on agricultural activity.  Also she is sure that she is doing well for the environment since her products are net organics.\r\n<p>\r\nGenerally she works together with her husband, but in the sowing season, she needs her farm workers to help her extract her fruits.  Normally she sells her product in the wholesale centers of her town, for a competitive price.  Her future plan is to continue growing her agricultural production of cocoa, and for that she will buy more hectares, with the aim to be able to plant her product, and in this way improve her socioeconomic level.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP, and she therefore assures that she will faithfully complete her payment obligations.  Also, she feels comfortable with her community bank, due to the transparency that the members offer.  With the loan she is requesting, she is thinking to invest in the purchase of fertilizer so that in this way, she can offer the proper maintenance to her cocoa plantations, with the aim to avoid damaging them.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy McGinty, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":596119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-06T22:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269309}],"funded_date":"2010-09-07T14:57:40Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy McGinty","image":348203}},{"id":233256,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julia de 33 a\u00f1os vende leche.

children: leparakuo, aged 22 years, Olobulu aged 20 years, Naeku, aged 17 years, Ntanani, aged 15 years and Nkaleyia, aged 12 years. They live in Bissil village and trade livestock at Bissil market in Kajiado, which is a busy market. Tenke sells his livestock to butcher men in Kitengela and Kajiado for slaughter. \r\n\r\nTenke was introduced to KADET by other KADET clients.

From farming, she has been able to earn a decent income, and she attributes all this success to hard work and determination. Although she makes profits, she has always wanted to increase her farming and start a cereal-selling business. The main challenge she has been facing is lack of funds. \n\nShe is seeking a loan to buy cereals. Demand for cereals is overwhelming in her remote village, and through your loan, she intends to buy different varieties of cereals and be able to satisfy the demand in her village and the local market. With your loan, Jane will improve her living conditions through increased profits from selling cereals. She believes that her cereal-selling business will increase by leaps and bounds. \n\nThere is no doubt that through your loan, Jane\u2019s life is permanently going to change, and she will ensure her school-going children have a secure future.\nShe dreams of being able to leave this business to her children, but only after it has become a success.

He started working in the biggest market in Ecuador named Bahia. His boss at a previous business sent him to rural towns to sell his products. When Victor and his wife decided they would go into business together, they based their business model on Victor\u2019s previous job. They had success early on because they knew exactly which towns were the most lucrative markets, and they offered promotions to the best buyers, whom they knew personally.<\/p>\r\n<p>Each day they work from 5am until 10pm. They have recently been so focused on sales that they have not had the time to replenish their inventory with new stock, so they sell goods in the morning and then use the proceeds from those sales to buy just enough shoes to still sell in the afternoon. Victor\u2019s wife is a great salesperson, and she typically sells in the small towns and at the local festivals which occur fairly often.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>They have two grown children who help sell their goods, and the family unit has maintained a strong foundation over the years. Their house is their greatest collateral. Victor will used his second loan to continue to increase the volume of shoes and clothing in stock to sell when the Riveras go to market. He is a 48 year-old with four children, who also contribute to the family business. His wife is his right hand, and he could not do anything without her. She is responsible for the finances, taking care of the house, and looking after the children. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many years ago they lived in Victor\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s home, but they saved enough money to move out on their own. Their new home was made of cane and they slept on the floor. Now, after working hard, they enjoy a house that is made of concrete, and each child has a room of his own.

He was trained to be an elementary school teacher.  He is married and the father of 4 children, 2 girls and 2 boys, all are adults (the oldest is 32 years old and the youngest is 22).  The first two are already employed, and the other 2 are studying at the university but are still his responsibility.<p>\r\n\r\nErnesto and his family moved from the province of Gaza to Namaacha in 1986 due to a job transfer so he could work as a professor in the teacher-training school located in Namaacha.  Since then Ernesto and his family have lived there and he works in the same school.<p>\r\n\r\nErnesto has a monthly salary of 7,400MTn and works from 7:30am to 10:00pm with a 2-hour lunch break.  Besides 2 of his children, Ernesto supports two nephews in the Chibuto province of Gaza sending them 1,500MTn monthly.  Still he is able to save approximately 2,500MTn per month with the help of receipts from a small stand he possesses.<p>\r\n\r\nIt has been 10 years since Ernesto began his selling activities in a small stand (store) in response to the increase in the cost of living.  His activities consist of selling a variety of drinks and basic staple products.  The best seller is a national beer with a 2M mark that is acquired for 200MTn per box and sold for 300MTn.  The monthly receipts vary between 2,000MTn and 3,000MTn depending on the time of year (winter or summer, respectively).<p>\r\n\r\nErnesto has his own home.  This is his second loan with Hluvuku and the first with Kiva.  The first loan for 20,000MTn was used to purchase construction materials to build a coop to raise chickens, a business that still isn't up and running.  Ernesto paid that loan off early and without difficulties.<p>\r\n\r\nWith this loan Ernesto intends to purchase products for his stand, increasing his stocks as well as his sales.  In the future Ernesto would like to purchase baby chicks to begin his poultry business now that the coop is almost finished.<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nErnesto tem 55 anos de idade e nasceu na prov\u00edncia de Gaza. Ernesto fez a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de professor prim\u00e1rio, \u00e9 casado e pai de 4 filhos, sendo duas meninas e dois rapazes, todos j\u00e1 maiores de idade (o primeiro filho tem 32 anos de idade e o ultimo 22 anos). Os dois primeiros j\u00e1 est\u00e3o empregados e os dois \u00faltimos estudam na universidade sob sua responsabilidade.\r\n\r\nErnesto e sua fam\u00edlia mudaram-se da prov\u00edncia de Gaza para Namaacha em 1986 devido a transfer\u00eancia que ele teve para ir trabalhar na escola de forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos professores situado em Namaacha como professor. Desde ent\u00e3o Ernesto e sua fam\u00edlia l\u00e1 vivem, Ernesto ainda trabalhando na mesma escola. Ernesto tem um sal\u00e1rio mensal de MTn 7,400, trabalhando das 7:30h as 22:00h com intervalo de 2 horas de almo\u00e7o. \r\n\r\nErnesto para alem dos dois filhos  sustenta mais dois sobrinhos que se encontram em Chibuto prov\u00edncia de Gaza, enviando mensalmente MTn 1,500. Ainda assim consegue poupar do sal\u00e1rio aproximadamente MTn 2,500 com ajuda das receitas da pequena barraca que possui.\r\n\r\nH\u00e1 dez anos Ernesto iniciou a atividade de venda em uma pequena barraca (loja) como resposta a subida do custo de vida. A atividade consiste na venda de variedades de bebidas e produtos de necessidade b\u00e1sica, onde destaca com mais sa\u00edda a cerveja nacional de marca 2M que \u00e9 adquirida por MTn 200 a caixa e vendida por MTn 300. A receita liquida mensal varia entre MTn 2,000 a MTn 3,000, dependendo do per\u00edodo do ano (inverno ou ver\u00e3o, respectivamente).\r\n\r\nErnesto tem casa pr\u00f3pria. Este \u00e9 o seu segundo empr\u00e9stimo na Hluvuku e primeiro no Kiva. O primeiro empr\u00e9stimo de MTn 20,000 foi usado para compra de material de constru\u00e7\u00e3o para construir uma capoeira para cria\u00e7\u00e3o de frangos, negocio ainda n\u00e3o iniciado. Ernesto pagou este empr\u00e9stimo sem dificuldades antes do tempo.\r\n\r\nCom este empr\u00e9stimo Ernesto pretende comprar produtos para sua barraca, aumentando assim o estoque e as vendas. No futuro Ernesto gostaria de comprar pintos para iniciar sua atividade av\u00edcola, j\u00e1 que esta quase conclu\u00edda a

She's 43 years old, married, and mother to six children.  The eldest is 26, and the two youngest ones are 13-year-old twins.  All are still students.  Besides her family, she helps her mother, sending money to the town of Pemba.\r\n\r\nPaulina studied until 7th grade in the old national system of education.  She stopped her studies due to health problems and financial difficulty in paying the fees.  Paulina left Cabo Delgado, accompanied by her husband, who was transferred by his work, and they have been here until today.\r\n\r\nPaulina works at selling clothes, a business that she learned from her sisters ever since she was little.  Her best product is clothing made out of African wax print cloth, sold for 125 meticais per blouse and 950 meticais for a suit.  She has a monthly income of 5000 meticais and saves 2000 of it.\r\n\r\nFor Paulina, this is her first loan from Hluvuku and Kiva.  She has never solicited a loan from other institutions.  She heard of Hluvuku through friends who are clients.  She plans with this loan to increase her amount of stock and supply more products for her clients.  She has a dream of constructing a store with future loans.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Ilse Ackerman, Kiva

He is an honest man who has been working for a business installing parquet floors for nine years.  He has great talent for this work, and with his earnings is able to meet his expenses.  German does not have a set schedule since contracts come in sporadically.  However, when he is contracted out he works hard for three weeks or more.  It is work that requires great precision.  The most difficult part is that it is not stable employment and, at times, he receives many contracts but there are also weeks at a time when he may not receive any work.  German wants to be a useful man, and knows that life still provides many opportunities which he wants to be prepared to confront.  With the money from the loan, he wants to buy his own tools for parquet installation so he can also do work independently.  In the future, German would like to have his own business in his current line of work but also would like to start another enterprise which he has yet to decide on.  <p>   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":220458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase the necessary tools to carry out his work, so that he can also take on projects independently.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-04T12:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"German","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-18T15:22:21Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:24:21Z","rounded_local_amount":178.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957577},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:07:41Z","rounded_local_amount":178.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227833},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":178.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423062},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":178.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116298},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":178.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011250},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":178.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594853}],"funded_date":"2008-11-04T15:22:21Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":76740,"name":"Mrs. Samouern Sok Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Village Bank loA. group consists of ten members who live in Phsar village in Kampong Chhnang Province.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Paralelamente a esto, Lorenzo se dedica a la ganader\u00eda, ya que tiene 4 vacas en su establo, de ellas extrae la leche para su consumo propio y para venta. Para Lorenzo y su familia dedicarse a las tareas agr\u00edcolas es la \u00fanica fuente de ingresos que poseen porque no solo les genera recursos econ\u00f3micos, sino que tambi\u00e9n les provee de alimentos b\u00e1sicos para su hogar. Es la segunda vez que Lorenzo est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y es de su agrado trabajar con sus propios vecinos, los cuales forman parte de su banco comunal. El dinero que ahora requiere lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de sacos de abono y fertilizante para sus cultivos.","en":"Lorenzo, 42, lives with his wife and 4 children in his own home.  \r\n\r\nFor more than 15 years he has been working in agriculture and with livestock.  He got started in this work because he inherited some land from his parents and from his wife\u2019s parents.  From then on they have been working the land tirelessly year after year as they follow the schedule for planting and harvesting.  \r\n\r\nAlong with this, Lorenzo has livestock.  He has 4 cows in his stable.  He milks them for his family\u2019s use, and he sells the rest of the milk.  The agricultural work is the only source of income for Lorenzo and his family.  This work not only generates economic resources, but it also provides them with basic foods for their home.  \r\n\r\nThis is the second time that Lorenza has asked for a loan with MFP.  It is his pleasure to work with his neighbors who form part of his community bank.  He will use the loan to buy bags of fertilizer for his crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":302950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-13T22:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorenzo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2044.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842061}],"funded_date":"2009-04-16T02:41:20Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":105412,"name":"Ana Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana Maria C.

She is married to Amorin, a motorbike mechanic by training and a seller of radio receivers.  Edith and Amorin have one son, who attends school. She attended school, but she stopped in primary school.  Together with her husband, she is meeting family expenses.  \n\nSauce condiments are what she sells, as well as baggies for packaging, as her secondary business.  She buys her goods in Dantokpa, the international grand marketplace of B\u00e9nin. She sells the condiments out of her house;  the baggies are sold door-to-door.

2-year old daughter in his parents\u2019 house, located 25 minutes from the city of Chiclayo in the Santa Rosa district.  The need to work to support his family led him to start a small business selling fresh fish on foot.  He usually works at night as an assistant in a bakery in the area.  For the past six months, he has also been working selling fish in the towns located in the Monsef\u00fa district, which is ten minutes from where he lives.\r\n\r\nHe goes very early to the docks to buy his fish, and then travels to Monsef\u00fa to sell his product.  He arrives home in the afternoon, rests, and then goes to the bakery to work.  The income he generates through these activities helps him get ahead in supporting his family and his parents.\r\n\r\nAlan wants to gather enough funds to start his own bakery, since he very much enjoys this activity and has been learning the trade for some time.  However, he is conscious that he must continue selling fish in order to save money.  For this reason, he is approaching Edpyme Alternativa for the first time for a loan of 900 soles.  He thinks he will invest these funds into the purchase of more merchandise to strengthen his enterprise.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to buy some land on which to build his own house.  Alan is well-known and respected by his neighbors and workmates, who consider him a charismatic, responsible and hard-working young man. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":391021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fresh fish to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Santa Rosa - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-09-19T12:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alan V\u00edctor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":78.08},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":80.34},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":81.92},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":87.68},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":93.99},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":101.09},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":104.37},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":108.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.58},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.2},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.01},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.58},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.69},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.58,"local_amount":70.84,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:57:07Z","rounded_local_amount":74.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939723},{"amount":28.2,"local_amount":78.08,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":81.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780631},{"amount":29.01,"local_amount":80.34,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":84.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669531},{"amount":29.58,"local_amount":81.92,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":85.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065038},{"amount":31.66,"local_amount":87.68,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:16Z","rounded_local_amount":91.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900152},{"amount":33.65,"local_amount":93.18,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":97.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934287},{"amount":33.94,"local_amount":93.99,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":98.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661927},{"amount":36.51,"local_amount":101.09,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":105.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694643},{"amount":37.69,"local_amount":104.37,"processed_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":109.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877708},{"amount":39.18,"local_amount":108.51,"processed_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":113.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617761}],"funded_date":"2009-09-19T16:58:54Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":142348,"name":"Besilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Besilia is from the village of Calamagui San Pablo, Isabela.

She is married to Efra\u00edn who is 49 and they have three children.  They live together in a house that they own in a community located in the District of Santa Rosa.  Through a great deal of effort, Blanca and her husband have been able to turn over their lands to make them very productive.  She is a farmer and works growing cacao plants, coffee and coca leaves, all of which support her income.  During the harvest, she has to hire laborers to quickly pick the fruits from the plants.  She has been working in agriculture for 21 years and has always proven to be responsible and dedicated to her work.  What she likes most is caring for her crops, as her income depends on this.  She considers the most difficult part to be transporting her products from the farm to the city of San Francisco, where they pay her more for each product.

He has been in this business for the past 5 years. Before that, this happily married father of five was mostly doing odd jobs in Bushenyi Town. Farming has extricated him out of his adversity, and for that reason he devotes most of his time planning how his business can gain stronger ground. \r\n\r\nThe fact that coffee sells highly on the markets in western Uganda has been giving him further motivation to work hard at establishing a bigger niche. Proceeds from his coffee sales have been used to purchase high grade manure for his farms.

She is married and lives with 3 children in Istaravshan. Rayno teaches Tajik language at a local school.

She is separated from her partner and lives alone with her children, Katerin who is 15, Milagros who is 13, and Alvaro who is 4. They all live together in their own home. It has been 5 months since she started selling from a small stand outside her house, offering a variety of dishes such as kebabs, grilled chicken, sausage and others. It is so well seasoned that it is much enjoyed by her loyal customers who frequently come to visit her establishment. In the beginning she offered home delivery of lunches, because the customers asked for this service, however she could not continue working at this pace due to lack of capital. Now her business is very gratifying because she only has to work in the afternoons until 10pm, giving her time in the mornings to perform household chores. \r\n\r\nIn the future Marilu want to make her business grow so as to have her own restaurant, but she knows that she needs more capital and a better infrastructure, but she will not stop working hard to reach her goal. This is her fourth loan cycle with MFP and she is committed to being punctual with her payments. With the loan, she wants to buy some cooking utensils that she needs to prepare her dishes. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Machelle Wilson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":530896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cooking utensils and ingredients to prepare menu items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-28T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":78},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":78},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":78},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":78},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":78},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":78},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":78},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.85},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.86},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.86},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.86},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.85},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.86},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.86},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":27.86,"local_amount":78,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":79.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751999},{"amount":27.85,"local_amount":78,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":79.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934455},{"amount":27.86,"local_amount":78,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":79.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673223},{"amount":27.86,"local_amount":78,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:29Z","rounded_local_amount":79.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887050},{"amount":27.86,"local_amount":78,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:46Z","rounded_local_amount":79.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154065},{"amount":27.85,"local_amount":78,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":79.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449339},{"amount":27.86,"local_amount":78,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":79.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588071},{"amount":27.86,"local_amount":78,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":79.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724687},{"amount":27.14,"local_amount":76,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":77.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462902}],"funded_date":"2010-04-28T18:42:21Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Machelle Wilson","image":261196}},{"id":200514,"name":"Vanessa Jireh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vanessa Jireh C. lives in the town of Sto.

She has been living there in the area of Faisal Mahmood for the past 8 years. Her husband works abroad. \r\n\r\nAzra has given birth to 3 children. Her eldest daughter is in class one while the others are too young to attend school. As her husband is abroad, all the household responsibilities fall on her shoulders. She is managing these responsibilities with great courage and playing her role as a mother and a housewife very well. \r\n\r\nShe is hopeful that an investment will be profitable for her business and she will be able to make more profits due to bulk purchasing that will allow her to offer her customers more variety.

","en":"Sonunbubu is 51 years old, a widow and has four children.  In search of a source of income for her family, Sonunbubu started her own animal husbandry business in 1989.  Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Sonunbubu was able to develop her business to contain two cows, ten sheep, ten goats and two horses today and yielding about 5,000 som per month.  Sonunbubu invested the profit into the higher education for her children, enabling her daughters to become and English language teacher and a lawyer and her son to become a military officer.  Her youngest son, Ulanbek, decided to stay with his mother and help her with the business because Sonunbubu's elderly mother-in-law decided to continue living with her family after Sonunbubu's husband's death.  In order to further expand her business, Sonunbubu requested a loan in the sum of 133,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase bulls for fattening up and resale.  She plans to use the profit from this loan to increase livestock quantity in the

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

He is 24 years old and single. To make a living, Anthony owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from  raising and selling hogs in the local community. Anthony has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\n\nAnthony joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anthony is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional hogs. This loan will be his first from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement his family's income. \n\nAbout HSPFI\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Shahrituz, Tajikistan. \r\n<p>\r\nHe is dedicated to agriculture, having 6 years of experience at this activity. Shoimardon has sown different kinds of vegetables and wheat. A part of his crop is destined for personal use and the majority he sells in the different markets of Shahrituz. \r\n<p>\r\nThe income that he generates with this activity varies depending on the season in which the product is harvested. That is why his wife and elder sons support him in paying the household expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nThe economic situation of the country has affected the acquisition of the supplies for productive work. The costs of fertilizers, supplements and insecticides have increased to the point where he needs a loan to be able to buy them. \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason Shoimardon is asking for a loan of 3400 TJS. You could become an important part of his family's life. Shoimardon deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him.\r\n<em><p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<em><p>\r\nIMON's History<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 59 years old and married to Alfredo V., 60, who is a fisherman. Her children have their own families with whom they live. Violeta lives in the town of Tanay, Rizal Province, in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nIn 2004, she joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with a chance of having start-up capital for generating income. During her first loan in ASHI, she carefully invested it in her fishing business and it gave her a reasonable income. Now on her seventh loan, she requests 20,000 PHP for the revival of her fishing business. Specifically, the amount will be used to purchase a white fishnet, green fishnet, black fishnet, rope, bamboo and labor expenses. This loan will help her business, which was destroyed from a huge typhoon, \u201dOndoy\u201d. \r\n\r\nAs a mother, Violeta dreams of sending her grandchildren to school and on to completing college degrees and finding jobs for a better living. She hopes that her business will expand for them so they will have savings for future use. She also enjoys seeing that the loan from ASHI will change their lives and accommodate her family's needs. Through the support of ASHI, Kiva partner, she will, step-by-step, realize her dreams.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":450831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

He is 22 years old. Gerson is married and has one infant-aged child. To make a living, Gerson owns and operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing motorcycle services used to transport local community members. Gerson has been engaged in his business for over 3 years and earns approximately PHP 5,000 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Gerson joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gerson has successfully repaid a previous loan of PHP 7,000 from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. Gerson is requesting a new loan of PHP 10,000, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Gerson from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She and her husband, Mr. Kosal Chhom, are farmers who own a plot of land where they cultivate rice. Mr. Kosal Chhom is also a village chief and earns a small income to support his family.

is 30 years old, and is married with six children, three of them are girls while the others are boys. Uum and her husband, Mamun buy waste material like plastic cups, plastic bottles, cardboard and paper from her neighbors and other houses in the village. Her husband uses a cart to collect scrap metal and other waste material. Households do not just give away waste material, because there is demand and therefore economic value in recycling. So the more working capital they have, the more scrap they can collect and recycle. Uum and her husband are the first link in this chain, buying waste and scrap materials from households, sorting and cleaning them, before selling them to an intermediate dealer. This dealer comes around in a small truck, collects the sorted-out material and takes it to the warehouses dealer. There, the different materials are weighed in front of Uum\u2019s husband, who then gets paid by the intermediate dealer. The warehouse dealer in turn sends the waste materials to various processing factories, which turn produce clean and reusable recycled paper, cardboard and plastic recycled raw materials. Waste recycling undertaken by Uum and her husband thus helps clean the environment by reusing waste material which otherwise would go to the landfills. In a week Uum can earn $6. She needs a loan of $50 and with this loan, she can buy more goods to sell , and thus more or less double her income.

So Alma is requesting a loan of $575, which she will repay within six months, to purchase fish and seafood so they can have more merchandise.

The loan she received helped her financially to initially invest into buying supplies\/materials to produce fine paper crafts.  After 10 years of using and investing the loan she received, her family\u2019s income has been steady with a present monthly income of 3.000.000.

These loans allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":231535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

This is 42-year-old Eva S. from Dar es Salaam. She is single with three children between the ages of 14 and 25. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because his parents cannot take care of him. \r\n\r\nEva has been running a poultry business since 2006. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. \r\nFirst, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 5-8 hours per day, seven days per week. Eva currently earns about US$500 from her business. She is requesting a loan to build a house for raising kuku. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Eva thanks you for your support!\r\n\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the
