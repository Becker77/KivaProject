Sandro was only able to study up to the fifth year of secondary school because of his parents' limited economic resources, and from a young age he needed to work to be able to help them, but he would have enjoyed studying auto mechanics.\r\n\r\nSandro works driving a motorcycle taxi.  He does this job about ten hours a day, with great effort, especially in this summer season when the heat is suffocating.  He believes that it is going well for him in his business because he is very respectful with his customers and because there is a lot of need for the residents to get around.\r\n\r\nSandro is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to their support he will be able to fulfill the procedures to get his driver's license, with which he will be able to give his customers greater security and avoid infractions from the police authorities.  In this way he will have more income to save and achieve his biggest dream, to have his own motorcycle taxi because the one he currently drives is rented.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":981870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

With capital limitation, Putu Dian could only prepare these prayer items on daily basis. If there were a big order, usually it is done with her parents and other friends in the surrounding.\r\nTo bridge the capital limitation, Putu Dian requested a loan to Lempek organization in her village, Lempek was grown by Dinari foundation. From here Putu Dian obtained the additional capital and also several guidance from Dinari Foundation. The loan obtained is used to buy raw materials, like coconut leaves, bamboo and other needs. From this Putu Dian could expand her business and assist in adding family income.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nPutu Dian terkenal di desanya sebagi tukang Banten ( sarana persembahyangan umat Hindu ) walaupun usainya masih muda. Pengalaman ini didapat dari orang tuanya yang juga berusaha dagang seperti itu. Pada mulanya hanya sekedar membantu membatu ibunya, tapi setelah menikah mulailah usaha ini ditekuninya sebagai usaha yang dapat membantu pendapatan suaminya. Dengan keterbatasan modalnya maka Putu Dian membuat sarana sembahyang harian saja. Jika ada pesanan untuk persembahyangan skala besar, biasanya dikerjakan bersama orang tuanya dan beberapa temannya yang ada disekitarnya. \r\n\r\nUntuk mengatasi kekurangan modal usahanya, Putu Dian mengajukan pinjaman dana pada Lembaga Tempek yang ada didesanya yang sudah menjadi Tempek binaan Yayasan Dinari. Dari sinilah Putu Dian mendapatkan modal tambahan dan berbagai pembinaan yang diberikan oleh yayasan Dinari. Pinjaman yang didapatnya digunakan untuk membeli bahan baku, seperti daun kelapa, bambu dan keperluan lainnya. Dari usaha inilah Putu Dian dapat mengembangkan usahnya dan dapat membantu menambah penghasilan dalam

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Edith manages her business with the help of her sister, who is in charge of selling beer every weekend.  This product sells very well during this time.  The profits have been very beneficial because they have helped her comfortably pay the rent for her location.  Edith is solely responsible for providing her son with an education because he hopes to pursue a professional career.  She enjoys developing her business, but sometimes she feels helpless because she is not able to restock her store as much as she wants.

He started his business in 1983. He is well-known in this field and has developed many relationships. His beginning capital was US$ 250. The business was challenging to him at first because he did not know much about running a radio. He also had to navigate renting a place, obtaining legal documents, and determining his employee\u2019s wages. As a beginner in the field, he had to be very careful. <P>\r\n\r\nWith determination and good management, he succeeded and was gradually able to increase his working capital from his profit and buy four more radios. His business is prospering and makes a profit of about US$ 500 per month. As Nkola has a vision of opening a big wholesale shop to provide business coming from villages, he decided to join one of Hope\u2019s groups named \u201cBwanya,\u201d meaning \u201cWorthy\u201d in English, last September. He plans to diversify his business with his loans by adding foods such as fresh fish, sacks of corn and miscellaneous other items. Nkola is 56 years old.

She is also a woman of strong faith to overcome all challenges to achieve her dreams. She is married to Eusebio L., a company driver.  She lives in Tanay, in the province of Rizal, Philippines. \r\n\r\nWith her faith to get out of poverty, in 1999 she decided to join ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), a microfinance institution and KIVA partner in the Philippines, for a chance to get start-up capital for generating income. During her previous loan with ASHI, she carefully invested in the sewing business. The profit is what she uses for daily expenses and for her children's education.\r\n\r\nNow on her eighth loan, she proposes a loan of PHP 40,000.00 pesos for a broader business. Specifically, the amount will be use to purchase an overlock sewing machine (serger), a high-speed sewing machine, assorted cloth, threads and other supplies. She is very disciplined in using the money that was lent to her in her previous loans from ASHI. \r\n\r\nShe still dreams of the best for her family:  to provide the best education for her children and to have a happy family. During almost 10 years in ASHI, Emily has shown herself to be hard working and strong-minded to make her dreams come true. She hopes that her business will expand so she can save for the future. Now, she is happy seeing that the loans from ASHI change their lives and accommodate their financial means needed to support her family. She wishes ASHI and all lenders all the best and want them to keep on supporting her family and other families who want to improve their standard of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":466245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a very hard worker and an honest woman, which has helped her to expand her business to where it is currently. However, she has plans to improve it for the future and needs some additional capital to do so.\r\n\r\nRajika is seeking a 40,000 LKR loan from BRAC. This is actually her second loan for her tailoring business as her first loan of 20,000 LKR was successfully repaid. Ultimately she hopes to expand enough to be able to provide employment for one or two people in the community.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to consider supporting this Sri Lankan

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Prossy is a 50-year-old woman with a sparkly sense of humor. This has helped her strike a chord with most of her clients at her firewood sales business in Mbiko Kasanja-Lugazi. M. Prossy has, over the last 4 years, defied the stereotype that aging people like herself should just rely on their children and grandchildren to survive. Contrary to expectation, she has managed to establish a niche for herself amidst strong competition from other firewood sellers in a region where firewood can easily be obtained from the neighboring mabire forest. At her age, she is surprisingly single but happy with her status saying she is in a position to provide for all her 4 children without the support of a man. That to her matters more than anything else. \r\n\r\nM. Prossy began this business with savings from her teaching job. Hard work is also a factor that she attributes to her success. As she makes progress on the 120,000 UGX she makes in a week, she is also taking a long view. She says she wants to eventually open new business horizons for herself in the near future by opening up a grocery store. She is getting remuneration as a teacher since she is still in active service. With this loan, she is looking at buying more firewood to sell to her increasing clientele to earn more profits.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":564892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lugazi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.377222 32.919722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-07-09T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Prossy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mustafah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Masaazi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hamidah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.18},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.18},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.18},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.18},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:14Z","rounded_local_amount":607366.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689428},{"amount":279.3,"local_amount":623550,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":631205.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903577},{"amount":325.39,"local_amount":726450,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":735368.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297050},{"amount":201.56,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":455524.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467324}],"funded_date":"2010-07-10T11:09:35Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":217075,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cecilia B. is from the village of Brgy.

She lives with her husband and their children as a monogamous family in the Darsalam neighborhood in Segou (4th region in Mali).\r\n\r\nNot having been to school due to social regions, from an early age she started working in income generating activities alongside her mother, who used to sell cooking condiments. After several years of learning at her side she acquired a lot of experience in small business management, so she decided to start her own business in the trade of firewood and charcoal. This is what she has been doing from her own home for the last 13 years. Her sales are good because she is the only firewood seller in the neighborhood. She is especially sought after when there are major social events (weddings, christenings and funerals). \r\n\r\nIn order to keep her increasingly numerous customer base happy, she is seeking the help of Soro Yiriwaso, which which she has been working for 30 months. She has paid back all loans obtained (3 group loans and 1 individual one). This is her second individual loan, which she will use to buy two truckloads of firewood. She stocks up in Sanando, on the Bamako road. Haoua Traore sells for cash or credit to a mostly female customer base. With this loan she hopes to make a monthly profit of 100000FCFA, which will allow her to finish her house and meet the needs of her family (clothing and food).<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: an Internet Caf\u00e9 and a meal supplies business. Her husband, Alan S., who is 56 years old, works as an Issue Clerk to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 18 to 26 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Chona joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Chona has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 25,000 PHP helped her increase her monthly income to approximately $723, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 12th cycle loan, she is borrowing 28,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for her internet cafe so that she can continue to save up for the future support of their children, so that they can send them to school to finish their studies. Ma. Chona S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She has been selling vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, onions and others in a street market near her home for more than 6 years.  She works with her mother who helps her in the business. They both go looking for merchandise from the farmers themselves.  Magali works every day from very early in the morning until 3 o'clock in the afternoon by which time she has made good profits for the day.  This work allows her to have her own income and put money towards her household finances.\r\n\r\nMagali has a lot of dreams which is why she works very carefully and safely.  Her goal is to have a much bigger stall so that she can increase the amount of merchandise she sells, with a wider range of products.\r\n\r\nThis is Magali's 3rd loan from MFP.  She is very happy to know that she has financial support and she likes being a member of her community bank because all the members are people she knows.  All the bank's members are responsible people who are very supportive of each other.

M. is from the village of Del Pilar, Cabatuan, Isabela. She is 42 years old, married, and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Cecilia and her husband own and operate a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating a welding business in the local community. Cecilia has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Cecilia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cecilia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to purchase materials and equipment. Cecilia is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase materials and equipment to be used in the business. This loan will be Cecilia's second loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherpeople, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married and has two children aged 13 and 7.  In 2005, she established her grocery business.  Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid one loan from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buy grocery goods for her business.  In the future, Sabitri plans to improve the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Margarita has a small business selling beauty products. She works every day for approximately ten hours and believes it is going well due to her experience and because she treats her customers well. \r\n\r\nMargarita is very thankful to the Kiva lenders. Thanks to the help given she can buy more merchandise such as cosmetics, perfumes, nail polish, deodorant, creams etc.. This way her business is better stocked and she can take care of more customers. \r\n\r\nShe can keep working and striving to achieve her big dream of owning her own home. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1311228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise.

She borrowed the first loan of 2,000,000VND and used it to purchase animal feed and livestock to raise at home. Thank to her experiences from many years raising livestock, her business is now very developed. Beside utilising the family's garden and pond area, she obtained loans to buy more pond area to raise fish. As an active woman, Mrs. Mung wants to improve her family's standard of living, so everyday she also sells pork in various markets in Ha Noi city with her son. This business is also a significant source of income for her family.

For the last five years he has worked painting cars.  He tells us that a friend taught him this skill and, since then, he gets occasional jobs painting cars and buses.  What he earns he uses for his personal expensses and to help with family expenses.  Two years ago, using all his savings, he acquired a mototaxi (three-wheeled, motorized vehicle, used to transport passengers and cargo) with which he earns his keep when he isn't painting vehicles.  He hasn't paid off this vehicle yet so he is requesting financing from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1000 new soles to pay it off and do some service maintenance that it needs due to its time in use.  His dream is to be able to buy another mototaxi so that he can continue to help support his family.  He is an optimistic, steady and hard-working young man.

With this loan, Lina will be looking to supply her store with blouses, women's pants and high heels. She will use the profit to supply her store. Her long-term goal is to earn enough profit to purchase a vehicle to move her merchandise.

She works independently from home selling shoes and general merchandise so that she can generate an income.  Her business started when her cousin sent her shoes from the city of Bucaramanga, which is in the Department of Santander, so that she could sell them in her town.  Bucaramanga is known for producing shoes and handbags of unmatched quality.  Gladis started out with a few customers who purchased on credit and gradually she built up a good clientele.  This has allowed her to diversify into other types of merchandise.  Using borrowed capital, she made direct purchases of handbags and clothing that she could sell.  As a mother and female head of household, Gladis has worked hard so that her only daughter can get ahead.  She currently lives with her mother and her siblings.  Going forward, her goal is to have a retail shop where she can diversify her product offerings even more so that she can meet the demands of the local residents.  Her greatest challenge is having sufficient capital to respond to her customers in a timely manner because they are placing larger and more frequent orders.  Since she extends credit, she has to wait to collect payment before ordering more merchandise.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason Gladis is requesting a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the money to buy clothing and handbags in bulk and with cash since these items have been pre-ordered.  Her investment will be successful because she will generate more orders and be able to respond to her special customers.  In the meantime, Gladis strives to fulfill her dreams.  She maintains a profitability rate from her sales of 11%.  With this injection of capital provided by her Kiva loan, she will be able to carry out her plans for growth.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":859788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase clothing, shoes, and handbags that have been pre-ordered.

Gulumkan has been working as a teacher at a local school for five years. In 2006 seeking additional source of funding for her family Gulumkan started her business in breeding of cattle. Using the starting amount of 15,000 soms (KGS) Gulumkan was able to develop her business which at present time amounts to nine cows yielding about 10,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk and dairy products. In order to further develop her business she has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to purchase additional stock. In the future Gulumkan plans to increase the number of cattle to be able to give education to her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":941025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Akaryk village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-10T01:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulumkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":645},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":860}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":10066.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285439},{"amount":1935,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":90596.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938386}],"funded_date":"2011-12-13T06:25:38Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:17:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":372843,"name":"Rudy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rudy is married and has two children.

","en":"Carlos is 44 years old.  He has been living common-law with his partner for four years; they have a daughter aged 1 year and 8 month.  They are currently living with his in-laws.  He has had many jobs since he was a young man, but never had formal employment.  Since 2002 however he has had a kiosk, his own electronics shop called \"G.\", strategically located where there are many passers-by.  He repairs radios and television sets; this is his passion and he is very happy doing this job.  He also buys used electronics which he repairs, replacing missing parts and reselling them for a good profit.  Carlos says that when it is not time to harvest the coffee beans, people do not have money and then do not need his services; but, when harvest time comes in April, his income improves to 400 to 500 soles per week not including the income from selling used televisions and radios.  His wife sells clothing and he wants to help her with part of the loan which he is requesting and so encourage the growth of his businesses.  Carlos has a good sense of humour and is very passionate about his work.  He joined his community bank in order to explore development possibilities.  He is committed to repaying his loan on time.  This is his first loan with MFP.  He will use part of the loan to buy used radios and televisions and the rest of the loan to help his wife to buy clothing and so increase her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":272029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrician","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy used radios and televisions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-17T22:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":105.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423764},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":105.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117076},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":105.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011989},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":105.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595574},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":105.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989836},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":105.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210972},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":105.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640475},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":105.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080119},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:42Z","rounded_local_amount":105.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996406},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":105.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841939}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T00:32:59Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":93347,"name":"Youssef","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Youssef is a 41-year-old man who lives in Saida, southern Lebanon, with his wife and their child.

The last two of them live with her.  She is happy with the loans received from HOPE because they help her to develop her business and give her hope.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":303417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy a box of fresh fish, peanuts, and spices to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

For 4 years, he's operated a business repainting cars, work that he began doing as an employee of another garage.  He now has his own business which is successful because he works with great care.  He keeps working for however long he has to so that he can complete the jobs he's charged with on time.  He is well paid for his labor, something that encourages him to keep the business going because it allows him to pay for his everyday needs and also save.  In the future, Isaac wants to offer auto-repair services and he's preparing to learn how to do it.  This is Isaac's first MFP loan.

Hoan has been in this business for over nine years and earns approximately 1,000,000 VND a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Hoan joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities.

Hoan plans to use the additional revenue to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nHoan is the leader of a five member group receiving a loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

She is forty-four years old. Josephine is married and has three grown children. To make a living, Josephine owns and operates a service-based business, providing manicure and pedicure services in the local community. Josephine has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately $65 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Josephine joined one of Kiva's field partners, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from GDMPC. Now Josephine is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand the services she provides. This is her fourth loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She is married and has eight adult children. To make a living, Soloiluma raises crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting bananas for sale. Soloiluma has been engaged in this business for more than six years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nSoloiluma joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Soloiluma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,750 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers like manure. Soloiluma is now requesting a new loan of 3000 WST, which will also be used to purchase fertilizers like manure. The loan will be the sixth taken out by the borrower from SPBD. Soloiluma plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 52 years old and single. She is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Rosalinda raises pigs for sale. She has been engaged in her business for over twenty years and earns approximately $113 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Rosalinda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. She is requesting a new loan of 14,500 PHP which will be used to purchase pig feed and other supplies. This will be her 4th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She is a very happy and hard working woman. She lives together with her husband and their youngest son Bryan, 13 years old. They are the reason for all of her efforts. She harvests carrots and gladiola flowers. This is Delia's daily work. With a great deal of effort she has managed to make her fields to be very productive, generating excellent quality harvests and very sought out by the wholesale market in the city of Tarma. Her favorite part of her work is caring of the plantations. She has had 15 years in the field. The most difficult part of the work is having to transport her products all the way to the city of Tarma. The sacks are very heavy. IN the future she hopes to have a stand in the wholesale market to improve her earnings. This is her seventh loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she will endeavor to be on time with her payments, not wanting to cause any troubles with her community bank, where she feels very content. With the thousand five hundred nuevos soles she requests, she will purchase pea seeds. This product is selling very well these months. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":596583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase pea seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-07T17:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1538.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549376}],"funded_date":"2010-09-12T18:09:34Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":233495,"name":"Depend On God Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatu F., who is holding the sign, is the leader of this group of five borrowers called Depend On God.

She gives manicures and does smocking detail on fabrics. \r\n\r\nAngeles joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 7,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $120, thus raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy materials for her smocking business so that she can continue to save up for the future improvement of her business and for the education of her children.  Angeles M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future needs of her family.  R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She will use her profits to revamp her salon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":914459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy hair extensions and relaxers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Akodessewa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":111,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":30672},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":31132},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":31599},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":32073},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":32554},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":33042},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":33538},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":34041},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":34552},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":35070},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":35596},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":36131}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.18},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.15},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.15},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.22},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.27},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.64},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":133.07,"local_amount":62620,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:34:16Z","rounded_local_amount":64492.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250885617},{"amount":68,"local_amount":32000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T12:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":32957.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257295436},{"amount":69,"local_amount":32470,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":33441.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263630639},{"amount":70,"local_amount":32940,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-18T08:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":33925.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270663589},{"amount":71.03,"local_amount":33425,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:28:41Z","rounded_local_amount":34424.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276771887},{"amount":67.16,"local_amount":31605,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":32550.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283314342},{"amount":371.74,"local_amount":174940,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":180172.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287065165}],"funded_date":"2011-12-20T18:33:20Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T10:23:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":360568,"name":"Mar","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Mar habite au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

Sarah is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. \n\nFor the past 7 years, she has been involved in mixed farming. She grows maize and vegetables, and she also keeps cows. Sarah has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce in a timely manner to the market. This challenge has not made her give up and she states: \"I have to do something for my family.\" \n\nSarah joined Juhudi Kilimo which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Sarah is from a remote village that has poor roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) which require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Sarah to achieve her dream and reach her goals. \n\nFor smallholder women in Kenya, accessing a financial solution is an uphill battle, but Sarah feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help women to gain respect and equality. The benefits of this loan are many because Sarah will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. As a result, her income will increase. \nSarah is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community, because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work. Sarah will use the loan to improve her living conditions and assure her children of a secure future.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2039737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2346.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2415.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2485.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2558.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2633},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2709.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2789.15},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2870.66},{"due_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2954.56},{"due_date":"2016-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3040.9},{"due_date":"2016-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3129.77},{"due_date":"2016-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3221.24},{"due_date":"2016-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3315.38},{"due_date":"2017-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3412.27},{"due_date":"2017-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3512},{"due_date":"2017-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3614.64},{"due_date":"2017-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3720.27},{"due_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3829},{"due_date":"2017-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3940.92},{"due_date":"2017-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4056.08},{"due_date":"2017-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4174.69},{"due_date":"2017-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4296.62},{"due_date":"2017-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4422.19},{"due_date":"2017-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4551.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.15},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.86},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.58},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.1},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.89},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.71},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.41},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.3},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.21},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.15},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.12},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.12},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.15},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.2},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.29},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.41},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.56},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.75},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.22},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":992404,"name":"Millicent","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ten years ago, Millicent started farming on a small inherited piece of land in Kerugoya, a remote town in Kenya.

With her first loan, she purchased merchandise, like MP3 discs, that she sold at the city fairs. This allowed her to provide for her children, who were very young then, and to help her husband with the househould income. Currently, Carmen is the owner of 4 booths at the 16th of July fair where she sells DVD movies, MP3 music, etc. However, this business has a very short life span. This is why Carmen asks for a loan to invest capital in a new product and obtain a booth at the Huyustus market in the city of La Paz where she will sell computer accessories, recorders, as well as compact discs, disketes, and DVDs.
