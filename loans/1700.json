She hopes this additional farmland will help to improve her living conditions.

Sunita has been in this business for four years, working from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily. She is able to make a fair monthly profit. \r\n\r\nIn order to improve her business, Sunita and three other members decided to form a joint group called EQUITY to access financial support. She is now requesting her second loan from Kiva's partner, Tujijenge Tanzania. Sunita used her previous loan, which she repaid successfully, to improve her business by starting to sell soft drinks.

With the profits that she gains from this year\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nRael and her group will receive a total of nine solar lights as well as input loans of maize and fertilizer to plant a total of 4.25 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1825526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-03-04T15:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-03T15:40:06Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Constance","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Desma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Colleta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":86830,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86830}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T18:47:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":848343,"name":"Luzmila Stefania","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Portoviejo es la capital de la provincia de Manab\u00ed en Ecuador.

hardworking 38-year-old man. He is married and has three children. Hurshed and his family live in a rural village. Hurshed has his own business in order to earn a living. He has been involved in growing agricultural crops and potatoes for many years. To earn additional income, Hurshed has another business. He has several heads of livestock that he fattens up for subsequent sale. Now Hurshed wants to expand his agricultural business, but does not have enough money to buy seeds for planting the crop. This is why he came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy seeds for planting potatoes. Hurshed really hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand for the support in advance."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1821530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She runs a small restaurant in her house where she serves delicious meals. She works Monday to Saturday from 8 am to 9 pm with help from her daughter-in-law.

","en":"In a very peaceful community in the center of Mexico, most people cultivate potatoes (although the land is very fertile and ideal for any type of product or seed). The group Bonita Luna was created there.\r\n\r\nJuana is the leader of the group. She is a 50-year old very cheerful and hard-working woman, who is married to Francisco, a farmer. Only two of their children currently depend on them, and they attend high school. Juanita, as most people call her, started a small grocery store 11 years ago. There were no stores in the community at that time, so people had to walk several km to buy any basic product. Moreover, people sometimes did not find what they were looking for. When she first started, Juanita sold sodas, eggs, milk, sugar and cans. She then heard about VisionFund Mexico and thought it would be a good idea to request a loan and use it with her savings to buy more products. Grocery stores became more popular later on, but Juanita has been determined to keep her business because it helps to cover some expenses. \"I would not like my children to stop studying for financial reasons\". Juanita had 9 children, 7 of whom stopped studying after high-school because of financial matters. She does not want this to happen with the youngest ones. \r\n\r\nShe will use the new loan to buy milk, bread, eggs, sodas and cans. She is very grateful to VisionFund Mexico because she has received several loans and has been able to make improvements to her house and to increase earnings thanks to her higher income. \r\n\r\nNatalia, Angelica and Martha are other group members who will invest in their lambs. Rosa Mar\u00eda and Candelaria will invest in chicken. \r\n\r\n*In the photo: all the group members in the building garden in the municipality where they live. Juanita is the one with a blue jacket.

He takes care with grapes and sells them at the local market. \r\n\r\nThis hardworking man has a great desire to start dairy farming and requested a loan to local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe startup program which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo enables rural poors to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 1,100 GEL for purchasing 4 sheep. \r\n\r\nElguja will start milking them and then sell the produced products locally. The loan will greatly assist him and Elguja will be able to improve his economic situation and live better. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":257.14,"image":{"id":1825844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To start dairy farming and purchase 4 sheep ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Orghuli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2015-03-04T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-03T22:00:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elguja","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":60.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":68.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":69.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74.07},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":81.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":85.01},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":87.36},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":90.29},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":93.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.95},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.51},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.26},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.04},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.6},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":60.48,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":61.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636277402},{"amount":29.49,"local_amount":64.87,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":65.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649613416},{"amount":30.95,"local_amount":68.1,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":69.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665093149},{"amount":31.51,"local_amount":69.32,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":70.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681390910},{"amount":32.98,"local_amount":72.55,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":73.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696601214},{"amount":33.67,"local_amount":74.07,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":75.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711520559},{"amount":34.79,"local_amount":76.55,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:55:36Z","rounded_local_amount":77.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731036384},{"amount":36.26,"local_amount":79.77,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":81.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752125240}],"funded_date":"2015-03-23T22:50:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tom D"}},{"id":848081,"name":"Jemima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jemima is a married woman and she has two children.

Su negocio lo desarrolla en la localidad de \u2018Sacaba\u2019 un \u00e1rea rural que se caracteriza por su crecimiento y por su potencial comercial y productivo. Ubicado en un valle semi-tropical, d\u00f3nde la venta de comida es abundante, variada y todo se acompa\u00f1a con chicha (bebida fermentada de ma\u00edz).

She is married and has 2 sons, who are 10 and 14 years old, and one daughter, who is 19 years old. Her business is a bakery.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, dependable, active, patient, responsible, and hard working. Her business is located in \u201cSacaba,\u201d a rural area that is characterized by its growth and by its commercial and productive potential. It is located in a semi-tropical valley, where food sales are abundant, diverse, and always accompanied with \u201cchicha\u201d (a fermented corn drink). The area has a mild climate the whole year. \r\n\r\nMartina has brown skin, long black hair that she wears braided, dark eyes, a short stature, and a thin physique. She wears traditional clothing (hat, blanket, and skirt). Her mother tongue is Quechua, which she speaks at home, and she speaks Spanish for daily life and for her work. In the picture, she is seated at the left, wearing a white sweater and pink apron.\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her husband, who does the same work she does, and with her children. The young children study in school, and the older daughter studies in a technical institution. They live in a house built from adobe, with a roof made of corrugated iron; their house has well water and electricity. \r\n\r\nHer need to provide for the needs of her family brought her to form a group with people who have business like: doing carpentry, selling meat pie, selling cosmetics by catalog, selling jackets, offering transportation, selling food, and a neighborhood store. She does this to request a loan and to grow her work. \r\n\r\nHer business is a bakery. The aroma of fresh bread takes over one of the streets of the area. The floor is scattered with hundreds of breads and baskets. In the middle of this, her bakery stands out. It displays the large \u201csarnas,\u201d which are similar to pizza, made of wheat and white flour, milk, cheese, and butter. She says that once someone tries a \u201csarna,\u201d they come to understand why her bakery is well known.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a bakery with many ovens and bakers who do her work for her so that she can rest. She wants to buy different varieties of flour by the quintal, including wheat, corn, and rice flours. This is her first sequence of loans with the institution in the 20 years she has been doing this work independently.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Marina requests a loan to buy varieties of flour to bake more bread and have more clients. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":1826225,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy varieties of flour to bake more bread and have more clients.

So to get more income by expanding her business, Mohini has planned to purchase more goats with the present loan amount. She hopes to save money for construction of a house and to provide better education to her children.\r\n\r\nThe other 10 members of her group are also doing small enterprises like vegetable vending, milk business, popped rice business, general store and transport business and, with this loan, hope to enhance their livelihoods.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1823535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase goats","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"M.Rampur, Kalahandi , Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2015-03-04T22:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-03T22:40:04Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Binita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrabala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dashudei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dharitri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dipanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dushila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saebani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":132000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-18T00:54:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":848376,"name":"Josefa Jacqueline","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El cant\u00f3n se llama as\u00ed en honor de la Virgen del Carmen.

He is married, and his wife does the household tasks. They are parents of two children, who don't go to school because they are still not old enough.\r\n\r\nRoberth is a farmer. He has been doing this work since he was very young, since he didn't continue his studies because he had to work to help his parents. In addition to agriculture, he also works in a mill that he bought, and he also works with his father in agriculture.\r\n\r\nRoberth will use the loan to buy products to sell, such as propane gas, telephone cards, and electronic recharges, since in the zone where he lives there are no sales of these products.\r\n\r\nRoberth's dream is that the business that he is going to begin can maintain itself and grow. He also drams of being able to expand the business in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1826233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy products such as propane gas, telephone cards, and electronic re-charges to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-03-05T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-04T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberth ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":44.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":44.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":45.97},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":48.99},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":48.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":52.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":53.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":55.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":56.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":58.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":61.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":62.23},{"due_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":64.4},{"due_date":"2016-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66.3},{"due_date":"2016-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":68.13},{"due_date":"2016-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":73.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.97},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.35},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.49},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.69},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.83},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.57},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.14},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.23},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.4},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.3},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.13},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":170.19,"local_amount":170.19,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650537475},{"amount":117.76,"local_amount":117.76,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":117.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666803366},{"amount":94.19,"local_amount":94.19,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":94.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683483424},{"amount":617.86,"local_amount":617.86,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":617.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696540966}],"funded_date":"2015-04-03T20:29:52Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:14:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":848127,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence is a married woman.

Her business is making straw hats by hand.  She is a good, understanding, enterprising, independent, responsible and hard-working mother.  She works in the community of \"Tundy\" which is located 25 kilometers south of the city.  It was founded over 250 years ago and the locals work mainly in livestock farming near the community.  The youth and children start to work early to help their families, often cutting off their education.  Usually the work they do is related to swamp work, care of the cattle and in some cases as babysitters or bricklayer assistants working in the city.  These conditions are considered to be risky jobs and involve the children in possible situations of labor exploitation.\r\n\r\nSilvia has a dark complexion, long black hair that she pulls back, dark eyes, medium height and a robust physical complexion.  Her mother tongue is Guarani which is spoken locally and she speaks Spanish for general cultural purposes and for her business.  (She is second from the right wearing a pale yellow top and pink bermudas, and holding a notebook.)  She shares her life with her husband who works in construction and their children attend school and help out in the business.  They live in a wooden house with a zinc roof and have electricity, but must go to the river for water.  The need to earn more income to feed her family is what motivated her to form a communal bank with people in businesses such as: chicken sales, laundry service, juice sales, food sales, a convenience store, farming, milk sales and wood trade, to request a loan and improve her economy.\r\n\r\nShe makes straw hats by hand out of  \"Sao\" (palm leaves).  It is a skill passed down from her parents.  The craft workers receive large orders, especially for village festivals in the the area and also in September when the Palm Queen contest is held.  \"Sometimes we get together with a neighbor and weave while reading a novel...because now we can do it without looking at our hands.  We read the book and our fingers work by themselves.  We're experts...\" she says.  Her dream is to feed her family adequately.  She wants to buy raw materials to make the straw hats.  This is her first loan through the institution in the seven years she has been in the business.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Silvia is requesting a loan to buy raw materials to make straw hats and use the profits to feed her family.

The climate is warm and tropical, and the temperature varies during the day between 18 and 38 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nMelany is small, slim and dark-skinned, with dark eyes and long, chestnut-coloured hair which she wears in a ponytail. Her mother-tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which is spoken in this area, and she speaks Spanish for her business and general culture. In the picture, she is the second on the right, wearing a white top, blue shorts and pink trainers. She shares her life with her partner, who works in construction, and her children, who are very young. They live in a rented room made of bricks, with a corrugated iron roof. They have drinking water, electricity and plumbing. \r\n\r\nHer need to give her children a better future inspired her to lead a Communal Bank formed of people with businesses selling products as varied as replacement automotive parts, cold meats, soft drinks, food, baby clothes and glassware, as well as people engaged in curtain-making, running a general store and a bookshop. They all came together with the aim of asking for a loan to improve their businesses. \r\n\r\nMelany's business is selling second-hand clothes. She buys second-hand clothes in bulk from the United States and sorts them according to gender and size. She organises them so that her customers can quickly find what they want. She sells the clothes from a permanent street stall, in the open air. She has arranged her stall like a room, with some clothes displayed on hangers in the interior of the room, and others on a table. She works every day of the week accompanied by her babies.\r\n\r\n\"I started my business because I needed to work and look after my children at the same time. This business gives me the freedom to do both. I'm independent, and I have regular customers,\" she says. Her dream is to give her children a comfortable life. She wants to buy more clothes in bulk so that she can expand her stock and increase her income for the well-being of her family. During the three years she has been running her business, this is the first loan cycle she has engaged in with the institution.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons, Melany is asking for a loan in order to buy clothes in bulk, so that she can increase her sales and provide for her children.

The volcano San Pedro towers above the town. It is here that eight very enthusiastic women have come together to form The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank, Perlas Preciosas San Pedro (Precious Pearls of San Pedro). Their purpose is to support one another and improve their lives. The women have agreed they will use a Kiva loan very productively.\r\n\r\nDolores is a member of the Trust Bank. She is 21 years old, married and has twin girls who bring her much joy, which motivates her work. Dolores makes regional blouses. Therefore, she is requesting a loan to buy fabric, thread, elastic, buttons, and other accessories that make the production of her blouses possible. With the income that she generates from the sales of her blouses, she is able to fulfill her goal of a university education, as well as being able to feed her daughters. Right now, she is beginning to study social work. The other members of the group are also making good investment decisions with their micro credit loans. The loans are helping with their crafts.\r\n\r\nThe members of Perlas Preciosas San Pedro are extremely grateful to the Kiva investors for believing in them and investing in the dreams of the Guatemalan women.

She has only six years of formal education. Her business is making typical bedspreads, tablecloths, curtains, shawls, and scarfs -- all are made in the local crafts manner. \r\n\r\nJuana is asking for a loan in order to purchase a large quantity of thread in different colors, designs and quality. She also wants to purchase accessories.  Juana has a great vision for her future and wants to have the ability to export her products to new markets with fair prices that can help her business stay afloat and make better profits. Her dream is that one day she does not need additional financial help. \r\n\r\nJuana uses her earnings to support two of her children with their university studies. Their studies motivate her to continue to want to learn and be educated. Additional education is possible for her through The Friendship Bridge non-formal education program, Microcredit Plus, which provides in its monthly Trust Bank meetings a variety of topics. One topic that was important to Juana was business management skills. The fusion of credit and education -- Microcredit Plus -- helps Juana and the other members of the group with the process of empowerment, which then helps them get out of poverty by themselves.

One has a shop that sells food. Manuela, 48, along with her family, has a furniture shop where she makes carvings, closets, cabinets and other furniture made of wood. The family business has had success. She wants to make more investments in the business, and thus is asking for a new loan that she can invest in buying raw material, wood and tools that she can use in make furniture, as well as accessories to enhance the furniture. Her objective is to strengthen her business and leave it to her children, since that is the only way she can provide them with a primary education. The youngest of the nine children is the only one who continues studying and that motivates her. \r\n\r\nThe Claveles Santa Rita hope to receive loans in order to continue fighting for their dreams.

The loan also helped her provide for the educational expense of her child and pay for their daily needs.\r\n\r\nShe is very positive that she can improve her business more if you will lend her an amount of 25,000 PHP. This new loan will go to additional stocks of groceries, toiletries and beverages. Her customers will likely buy more items if she has more of her products displayed in her store. An increase in sales will also result in a significant increase in profit which will result in her business becoming viable and sustainable.

Prior to owning his own food truck, he worked for a well-known San Diego Mexican seafood vendor who taught Fabian everything he knows about cooking and running a business. \r\n\r\nIn April 2014, Fabian purchased a food truck and vending location from a family friend. Within a month, he started serving food outside of a local Mexican market. A family owned and operated business, Fabian and his wife run the day-to-day operations of the food truck and are open every day of the week. \r\n\r\nGrowing up in the coastal town of San Felipe, Mexico, Fabian discovered his love for seafood as a young boy. He worked for many years preparing and cooking seafood before relocating to San Diego with his family. \r\n\r\nAlthough Fabian had enough personal capital saved up to purchase the truck ready to operate, he was in need of additional capital to do maintenance and improvements. He is using his Kiva loan funds to tune up the motor and to redo the dining area near the truck. He plans to put in grass and a couple of sets of chairs and tables for his guests to enjoy their meals right next to the truck. \r\n\r\nOver the past several months since opening his business, Fabian\u2019s biggest challenge has been attracting new clientele. He is confident, however, that the planned improvements to the dining area near the truck will invite new customers. His truck is also located along a busy street.\r\n\r\nAs a first-time business owner, Fabian is excited to be embarking on this adventure. With the help of generous Kiva lenders, Fabian is able to turn his passion for seafood into a business that will support his family.

He has an eight-year-old son and a one-year-old daughter. His business is making metal doors. He is a good father and is enterprising, independent, dedicated to his work, responsible and a hard worker.\r\n\r\nHis business is located in the 'Gran Poder\" zone of the city, which is largely commercial in nature. It is also known for the festival of Se\u00f1or Jesus del Gran Poder [Lord of Great Power], a traditional folkloric celebration with extravagant costumes and dance in honor of the venerated image (on canvas) in the local Temple. The climate there is cold and dry with temperatures ranging from 8 to 21 degrees centigrade [46 - 70 F] throughout the year. The altitude is 3600 meters (11,800') above sea level. \r\n\r\nNoel has a dark complexion, short black hair, dark eyes and is short and of average build. His mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1 which he speaks at home, but he uses Spanish for his business and for general purposes. He shares his life with his wife who takes care of their house and children. The elder child is in school and the younger one is learning to walk. They live in a rented house built of brick and concrete with a tin roof. It has running drinkable water, electricity and sewerage.\r\n\r\nHis occupation is making folding and smooth metal doors for houses and garages. He learned this trade from his father and later became independent and started his business. \"I began to learn this trade when I was very young as my father's assistant. When I started off on my own I already had clients which helped me stabilize my business...\" he states. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to buy a house so that his children have their own home. He wants to expand his business by buying a sheet metal folding machine which he needs to offer a greater variety of designs and finishes on his doors. This is his first loan sequence with the institution in the 11 years he has had this business. This is why Noel is asking for a loan - to buy the sheet metal folding machine to expand his offerings of metal doors and to increase his sales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1826576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sheet metal folding machine, to expand his offerings of metal doors and increase his sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-05T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-04T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noel Ramiro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":4200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":269.35},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":364.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":390.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":397.64},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":419.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":426.82},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":457.73},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":474.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":491.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":508.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.52},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.18},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.22,"local_amount":270.29,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":277.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214367},{"amount":54.71,"local_amount":367.67,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":378.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564492},{"amount":57.51,"local_amount":386.46,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":397.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046457},{"amount":59.17,"local_amount":397.64,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":408.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344278},{"amount":413.39,"local_amount":2777.94,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2856.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554496}],"funded_date":"2015-03-07T14:17:21Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":848441,"name":"Teddy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teddy is a 27-year-old married woman living in Masindi, Uganda.

Mayramo has been involved in animal husbandry for 20 years. She completed 9 school grades and did not go to a university because her family did not have money to pay for the tuition. Now she has a large plot of land, where she takes care of six cows and three sheep. Mayramo milks the cows every morning and takes milk to a market for sale.
