EL lugar ya se ha desarrollado con el paso del tiempo y cuentan con servicios como escuelas, centros de salud, luz, drenaje, agua potable. Sin embargo, la comunidad conserva su tranquilidad y la amabilidad de las personas. \n\nEl grupo de pr\u00e9stamo est\u00e1 integrado por personas trabajadoras y decididas a forjar un mejor futuro para los suyos: Ma Elidia quien se dedica a criar y vender borregos; Josefina, a la venta de abarrotes; Carolina, a preparar y vender jugos y ensaladas de frutas; Federico, a criar y vender vacas y borregos y finalmente, Juan, a vender alimento para becerros.\n\nDon Federico form\u00f3 una familia con do\u00f1a Alejandra hace 23 a\u00f1os, procrearon 5 hijos de los cuales ya s\u00f3lo dos dependen econ\u00f3micamente de ellos; uno estudia la primaria y el otro la secundaria. Don Federico habla algunas palabras mazahuas y est\u00e1 orgulloso por ello aunque no puede entablar una comunicaci\u00f3n al 100% en este idioma, el de sus antepasados.\n\nDon Federico recibi\u00f3 su primer pr\u00e9stamo hace ya 9 a\u00f1os, desde entonces inici\u00f3 con la compra y venta de ganado el cual conserva y cuida durante 4 meses para despu\u00e9s venderlo. La alimentaci\u00f3n de sus animales es fundamental ya que determina el peso de los mismos y puede obtener m\u00e1s beneficios al momento de venderlos por kilo. El fr\u00edo ha hecho algunas malas jugadas al negocio de Federico, le ha quitado ya algunas cabezas de ganado lo que para significa p\u00e9rdidas para \u00e9l. Sin embargo, su dedicaci\u00f3n le ha impulsado a continuar con la actividad y siempre trata de mejorar el lugar donde conserva a los animales, espacio con el que no contaba al principio. En esta temporada, la comunidad donde vive Federico, enfrenta la sequ\u00eda, los prados han perdido su color y por ello necesita comprar pastura con su cr\u00e9dito.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, Federico tambi\u00e9n renta mesas y sillas para brindar aun mejores oportunidades a su familia. Este segundo negocio fue posible gracias a sus ahorros, ganancias de la venta de ganado y a los dem\u00e1s pr\u00e9stamos es por eso que agradece por cada uno que se le ha otorgado.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el kiosco del municipio donde viven los integrantes, el cual ofrece una vista agradable. Don Federico est\u00e1 sentado en segundo escal\u00f3n, viste camisa de manga larga color azul y una gorra naranja. Por las ma\u00f1anas, en el lugar se observan varios vendedores de caf\u00e9 y atole calientes para que las personas logren atenuar un poco el eterno fr\u00edo de la regi\u00f3n.","en":"The members of the Ejido de Mayorazgo community bank are drawn from the indigenous Mazahua people of this region.  The area is developed and well-serviced with schools, health centers, and electric and clean water services.  Even so, the people here maintain a serene and friendly way of life. \r\n\r\nThe group's members work hard and are committed to building better futures for themselves: Ma Elidia raises and sells sheep; Josefina has a corner grocery; Carolina makes and sells juices and salads; Federico raises and sells cattle and sheep; and Juan sells livestock feed.\r\n\r\nDon Federico and his wife, do\u00f1a Alejandra have been married for 23 years and have 5 children, three of whom are independent now.  One child is still in elementary school and another is in high school.  Don Federico speaks a bit of the Mazahua language and says that even though he isn't 100% fluent he is proud to know something of the language of his ancestors.\r\n\r\nDon Federico received his first loan 9 years ago.  Since then, he has started his own business buying and selling cattle.  He keeps the cattle for 4 months, fattens them and sells them on to his customers.  His success depends on how much weight the cows add before he sells them so the care and feeding of the animals is critical to his business.  The cold has been hard on Federico's business and killed some of the cattle, a significant loss for him.  He has persevered, nonetheless, and tried to improve the space where he keeps the cattle.  He now needs hay for the cattle because the area here faces drought and much of the grass has died.\r\n\r\nFederico has a second business renting tables and chairs.

Desde el camino que se recorre para llegar al lugar, se pueden apreciar las grandes extensiones de invernaderos de nopales ya que la siembra de este producto es una de las principales actividades.\n\nMaricruz  tiene 28 a\u00f1os, es muy reservada pero dedicada y tiene un peque\u00f1o de 2 a\u00f1os que a\u00fan no asiste a la escuela. Desde peque\u00f1a, los padres de Maricruz le ense\u00f1aron a entender y vivir el mundo de los negocios. \u201cMi padres siempre han sido comerciantes, cuando no ten\u00edan con quien dejarnos, yo y mis hermanos tambi\u00e9n ayud\u00e1bamos en lo que pod\u00edamos\u201d. \n\nCuando escuch\u00f3 hablar de VisionFund M\u00e9xico, decidi\u00f3 solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo para iniciar un negocio propio, aunque fue dif\u00edcil decidir el tipo de mercanc\u00eda, finalmente eligi\u00f3 productos de limpieza y productos de pl\u00e1stico para el hogar como trapos para cocina, tenedores, cucharas, pinzas para ropa y cubetas entre otros, en los que invertir\u00e1 nuevamente su pr\u00e9stamo. Hoy en d\u00eda Maricruz, ya cuenta con 9 a\u00f1os de experiencia en esta actividad.\n\nElla vende caminando entre las calles de la capital del pa\u00eds donde no hay tanta competencia como en su comunidad. Para aprovechar el tiempo, renta un peque\u00f1o cuarto junto con su esposo y s\u00f3lo regresa a casa en momentos determinados. Durante la temporada de lluvia, el negocio se ve un poco afectado por las ventas bajas, pero Maricruz no se desanima con la situaci\u00f3n, ya que sabe que esa \u00e9poca tambi\u00e9n termina y las ganancias vuelven a mejorar. \n\nSu sue\u00f1o es vender en mayor cantidad para incrementar sus ganancias y poder construir una casa m\u00e1s grande en su comunidad, tal vez tener un local y dejar de viajar tanto.\n\nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Juana quien inviertir\u00e1 en bolsas de mandado; Hilaria, en pl\u00e1sticos y fibras; Lourdes, en jarcer\u00eda; Celia, en su tienda de abarrotes; Audifren, en cacerolas y Armando, en su panader\u00eda.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada afuera de la casa de Maricruz, ella es quien tiene el sombrero y una abrigo negro*\n","en":"\"El Pozito Comercio\" is a lending group that was formed in a very peaceful community who residents are very kind and hardworking.  From the road that leads to this community, one can see the huge cactus greenhouses since this product is one of the main economic activities of the region.\r\n\r\nMaricruz is 28 years old, she is very reserved but very dedicated to her work.  She has a two year old son who is not yet in school.  From a young age, Maricruz's parents taught her how to understand and live in the business world.  \"My parents have always been business people.  When they did not have someone to leave us with, my siblings and I would help them however we could.\"  When she heard about VisionFund Mexico, she decided to seek a loan to start her business with.  Although it was difficult to decide what kind of business to start, she ultimately chose to sell cleaning supplies and plastic products for home use such as dish towels, forks, spoons, clothespins, buckets, etc. She will use this loan to purchase these products.\r\n\r\nMaricruz has nine years of experience in this business.  She sells her products in the streets of the capital, where there is less competition than there is in her town.  In order to take make the most of her time, she rents a small room with her husband and only returns home at designated times.  During the rainy season, the business is affected by the decrease in sales, but Maricruz is not discouraged by the situation since she knows that the season will end and her earnings will increase again.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to sell in greater quantities so that she can increase her sales and build a larger house in her town, or possibly get a bigger store and stop traveling as much.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Juana, who will purchase grocery bags; Hilaria, who will purchase plastic and thread; Lourdes, who will purchase ropes; Celia, who will invest in her grocery store; Audifen, who will purchase pans; and Armando, who will invest in his bakery.\r\n\r\nThe picture was taken outside of Maricruz's house, she is wearing a hat and a black jacket."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6100,"image":{"id":1826552,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"purchase cleaning supplies and plastic products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"san antonio Enchisi, Atlacomulco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-03-05T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-04T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":6100,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Audifren","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Armando","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":91000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":11375},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11375},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11375},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11375},{"due_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":11375},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":11375},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":11375},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1525,"local_amount":22750,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:02:41Z","rounded_local_amount":22791.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769264},{"amount":2287.5,"local_amount":34125,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":34187.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649764022},{"amount":1525,"local_amount":22750,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:25:14Z","rounded_local_amount":22791.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597547},{"amount":762.5,"local_amount":11375,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":11395.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682140937}],"funded_date":"2015-03-07T22:31:21Z","paid_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Roberto Henry"}},{"id":848727,"name":"Merlelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlelyn is a hardworking entrepreneur, who has a restaurant business in the Philippines.

Ozoda tends to one cow and two sheep and also grows vegetables and fruits on her land plot. Ozoda harvests her produce herself and brings it to the market to sell.

The tropical weather is warm and humid.  The temperature remains constant between 18 and 35 degrees Celsius throughout the day.    <br \/><br \/>Wilma has an olive complexion, short black hair that reaches her shoulders, dark eyes, medium height, and a slim physique.  Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which is spoken among her family, but she also speaks Spanish as part of the general culture and for conducting business.  In the photo, she is standing in the back, second to the right, and wearing a white blouse.  She shares her life with her family members who also work.  They live in a brick house that has well water and electricity.  Her dream is to have her own restaurant.  <br \/><br \/>Wilma is the leader of a Communal Bank that includes businesspeople who sell vegetables, sell traditional juices, produce traditional baked snacks, manage a butcher shop, sell slippers, sell secondhand clothes, and sell perfumes.

His wife makes sour cream with the milk from their dairy cows and sells it at the market.  Their revenue only allows for a few small purchases.  Mirzosuhayl works hard because he wants to take care of his family and to have the chance to give his children an education.

The village she and her family dwell in lacks opportunities for employment. \r\n\r\nHer husband is engaged in cultivation of seasonal vegetables like corn, ginger, turmeric and other leafy vegetables. He supports his family from the income he gets by selling his produce. Boungcham engages in a charcoal business that is very profitable for income generation, especially during winter season. She provides educational expenses for her children and family expenses from her charcoal business income.\r\n \r\nShe applied for a WSDS loan to start running her business in full swing once again. The Kiva loan will be used to buy at least 30 sacks of charcoal from the villagers at low cost, which she will resell in the town market at higher rates. The profit she makes will provide for her baby and the educational cost of her two daughters. \r\n\r\nShe is very excited to get loan and consider that she will be able to stand on her own feet again since her last pregnancy. She hopes for successful business. The rest of the group members are engaged in poultry, piggery, grocery store and fishery businesses. The Kiva loan will be use to improve their business endeavours. They are all very excited and send their thanks to the lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1826365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy sacks of charcoal to resell for profit to provide for her family\u2019s expenses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2015-03-06T13:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-05T13:00:05Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zeite","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sinneeng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"W Selmom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zeite","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chungsum","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Boungcham","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reineihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neingak","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Boungsiem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ringnei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chungso Ean","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":165000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":165000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-24T08:48:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":848921,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":360,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Start-Up"],"use":"to open a grocery shop.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-6 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":379,"posted_date":"2015-03-06T13:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-05T13:00:05Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.66,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":160000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":89.92,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:59:19Z","rounded_local_amount":164817.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.08,"payment_id":649531972},{"amount":82.97,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":164817.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.03,"payment_id":681310552},{"amount":171.45,"local_amount":320000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":329634.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.55,"payment_id":696520053}],"funded_date":"2015-03-06T15:56:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":848922,"name":"Estrella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Estrella, 34, is a married woman with five children, four of whom are currently in school.

Lenders! Meet Celina, 45, a mother of three who has defied the notion among her friends that farming is an old-fashioned way of earning a living. Her primary sources of income are cabbages, milk, eggs and farming. Celina hails from Nkubu, Kenya, an area that enjoys favorable weather patterns that boost crop production in the area. Celina, being someone who is very ambitious and someone who always takes advantage of positive things, would like to capitalize on the good weather patterns experienced in the region and boost her farming. Being a hardworking mother, Celina has always ensured putting food on the table for her family. She also ensures she is able to take her children to school. Celina detests living in conditions of poverty and she has a plan to improve her standard of living. This is why she is seeking a loan of 57,200 KES in order to be able to purchase a dairy cow. This will help in producing milk and manure to be used on her farm. Milk from the cow will be sold to the local market and this means improved cash flow. Through improved cash flow, profits will be higher and she can comfortably take care of her family and take her children to school. Through your loan, Celina will be empowered economically and be able to improve her standard of living and also those of people living within the area. Celina is very comfortable with the repayment plan and the monthly installments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1827081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She was born in the city of Latacunga, which belongs to the Cotopaxi province, one of the provinces best known for its hard-working people in the country of Ecuador. She is currently married. She has a small son. She lives in the home of her parents. The largest obstacle that she has had is having had a job since she was very young to be able to help her household. For this reason, she had to go out to look for work, and now she is a great support to her husband since they share expenses.\r\n\r\nNowadays, Jessica has made a living from selling legumes and vegetables for more than four years. She learned this activity from her sister, with whom she has shared this business since some time ago. The most difficult activity in this business is without a doubt the lack of transportation for the transport of her product, since she spends a lot on transportation.\r\n\r\nHer dream and desire is to be able to have a car and a better lifestyle, because of which in the future they lack nothing. She needs the loan to purchase more products since because of having a very large order she has a lack of products.

She started selling products by catalog or specialized guides of different articles and little by little grew, adding to what she offered what her clientele needed made to order for them. She also offers personal and professional  service image improvement services to her clients. <br \/><br \/>That is how today she has a beauty salon and a general store or sales point where she displays her products and also a house on her property. This improvement did not happen by chance she worked very hard with long hours from 7 in the morning until 7 in the evening every day without stopping to achieve this. <br \/><br \/>Currently she is applying for a loan from Kiva through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo with which she will buy a variety of merchandise and school supplies, taking advantage of the school term's high sales periods of these items. With this investment her inventory will grow and this will have an impact on her sales in her business which will make it a successful investment. <br \/><br \/>Her goal later on is to expand her general goods sales and make improvements to her house with the aim of raising the image of quality of her business and manage to attract more

He lives in the same community with his wife, who takes care of the housework. Mousa was working in storage until one day he changed his business to breeding. He has 11 years of experience breeding livestock. He acquires his sheep at the various local trade fairs and resells them in the same fairs. He takes loans with RMCR, which allows him to increase the number of his livestock for breeding.
