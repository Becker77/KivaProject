Zhazgul intends to increase her livestock headcount, which will lead to increasing a higher combined profit from reselling livestock. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further developing her business and repairing her house.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1825809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 3 cows and 2 calves in order to increase her livestock headcount","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kararcha village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-03-06T20:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-05T20:00:06Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.79,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zhazgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:49:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25228.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995916},{"amount":404.71,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:59:31Z","rounded_local_amount":25228.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.79,"payment_id":730933744}],"funded_date":"2015-04-05T10:36:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":846490,"name":"Nathan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\nNathan is age 58 and married with ten children.

For the past 15 years, Agnes has been actively involved in mixed farming. Her primary income comes from milk and crop farming. \r\n\r\nAgnes loves dairy farming. Milking her cow is her hobby, and feeding her cows makes her very proud. Dairy farming is very fulfilling for Agnes, but because Nkubu is a remote area without piped water or electricity, she faces the challenge of irrigating her farm and providing water to her animals. Since she is from a marginalized community, she is forced to walk long distances, typically two hours, to search for water. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Agnes is requesting a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. She also plans to buy cereals for re-sale. Most of the rain water in her area goes to waste, and Agnes wants to harvest and store it in a water tank. Agnes will also be able to sell cereals to the local market and increase her income. \r\n\r\nThis loan will save Agnes time and allow her to irrigate her farm during dry seasons and increase her productivity and hence her income, which will provide her with financial security. She will also use the stored water for home consumption. \r\n\r\nAgnes\u2019s dream is to increase her farming activities and provide her child with a proper education.

Using the last of her savings from banana farming, Lucy decided to start her own business from scratch to provide solar energy solutions to local communities without access to reliable, affordable energy. For the past 5 years, Lucy has been working with One Degree Solar to sell BrightBox to women\u2019s groups, schools, and households in her town. \n\nWhile happy with her initial success, Lucy has realized that many customers cannot afford to pay with cash upfront. These same customers are often stuck spending $10-$15 per month - a considerable portion of their income - on lighting and phone charging. To break this cycle and provide renewable energy to these customers, Lucy would like to start offering flexible payment terms to those who need it most, while also increasing her inventory on hand to serve more customers. She seeks support from Kiva lenders to make this happen.\n\nLucy will use funds for 15 units of BrightBox solar kits, which will energize and empower households across her region. Customers will be able to collect BrightBox systems immediately and pay for them upfront or over several months. Since they are currently spending money on polluting, unsafe, and inefficient energy, most will save enough to recoup costs in 4-5 months and never worry about fuel or fire again. With your help, Lucy will help families eliminate energy expenses, improve safety, and allow their children to read into the night.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1829962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"To purchase solar lights to supply to households and schools without energy access.

He is married with five children between the ages of two and 16 years.  Three of them go to school. He is a farmer and has been producing rice for 14 years. His wife is a businesswoman. With the loan from Kiva, he would like to buy more fertilizers to grow rice to sell. The profits from the business will be used to renovate his house.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

The profits from the business will be used to pay more workers.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, to buy more fertilizers, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

So, she decided to start trading business with the loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers.  \r\n\r\nNatia\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she was unable to satisfy their requirements. She received the credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo - Startup Program that gives poor people the chance to start or restart businesses. Natia will rent or purchase a place for her new business, renovate it and start selling various kind of flowers. \r\n\r\nThe little store she will own because of Kiva lenders will become the significant source of income for this six-member family and will satisfy even their increased needs.

Meet Milka, who is 43 years old and is very hardworking, honest and humble. She hails from Eldoret, Kenya, an area that is blessed with elite and world renowned runners and also the best weather patterns that favor farming activities. \r\n\r\nMilka is a proud mother of four children whom she really loves and adores. She will do anything in her power to always give them the best. \r\n\r\nShe has been farming for the past five years, and through these years she has always provided them with all the basic needs that they require. Milka practices mixed farming, that is, crop and animal farming, and through these two she has been able to support her family, but she still faces challenges, which is why she wants to diversify and start poultry farming so that she can make ends meet. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to buy poultry, and she believes that through the increased income she will be able to comfortably take care of her family and assure her grandchildren a secure future. \r\n\r\nMilka has experienced difficulties in acquiring funds to start her poultry business, but she now feels relieved knowing that Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and other lenders to support aspiring women like her to be economically empowered and be able to realize their dreams.

He lives in a rural commune in Mali and is turning to  RMCR so that he can get some money to buy bulls to fatten. His ambition is to be a significant breeder in his town. His business consists of buying small bulls and then fattening them up for at least several months before he resells them in the market in his town. The funding he gets from RMCR is used to buy small bulls. The money he makes from this business helps him to provide for the family's expenses. He has been carrying out this trade for the past ten years and confirms that he gets a lot of interest in his animals, around 30,000FCFA per head.

Meet Irene, a youthful, 38-year-old mum. Irene is happily married and, together with her husband, blessed with four lovely children. \r\n\r\nShe is a wise farmer, whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in Eldoret, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. For the past 12 years she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been growing maize and vegetables. She also keeps dairy cows. She has been able to provide nutritious food for her family.\r\n\r\nAlthough she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. Irene is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge that has caused her to suffer so many losses. Perishable products, such as milk, vegetables, and tomatoes, require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said.\r\n\r\nIrene mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva lenders, to buy another motorbike. Through this loan, Irene is going to achieve her dream and goal.\r\n\r\nAccessing a financial solution is an uphill battle for women in Kenya. Irene feels relieved now to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo (with help from Kiva) that help women so that they can gain equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are many, because Irene will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market. In addition, she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market, increasing her income level. \r\n\r\nIrene is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community, because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping her in farm work. With your loan, Irene will improve her living conditions and assure her children of a secure future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":428.95,"image":{"id":1827424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy another motorbike to transport produce to market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-07T14:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-06T14:00:07Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.23,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51.72,"local_amount":4597.2,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4735.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265240},{"amount":48.68,"local_amount":4326.88,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4457.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601376},{"amount":49.58,"local_amount":4407.31,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4540.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459906},{"amount":53.83,"local_amount":4827.03,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4972.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.47,"payment_id":681378286},{"amount":50.66,"local_amount":4573.38,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4711.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.79,"payment_id":696587993},{"amount":55.55,"local_amount":5165.62,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5321.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.56,"payment_id":711506263},{"amount":56.6,"local_amount":5155.62,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5311.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.4,"payment_id":731023116},{"amount":56.1,"local_amount":5076.66,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5229.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.01,"payment_id":752111257}],"funded_date":"2015-03-23T13:40:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":849202,"name":"Carmelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmelita is a married woman with six children.

She has been doing agriculture for 7 years now. She makes money selling produce from her farm, including milk, eggs, and crops. She enjoys plowing her farm and watering her plants. Crop diseases pose a big challenge for her and also poor productivity. Getrude is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs. With the loan, she plans to buy good quality seeds and fertilizer, which will help increase soil fertility and productivity on her farm. Increased productivity will allow her to improve her quality of life and living standards. Through training from Juhudi Kilimo, she has learned about the culture of saving and she plans to use the increased income to improve her farming.

For the past year, Jeniffer has been actively involved in mixed farming. As she is from rural Kenya, gender roles still adhere and women do the heavy work of fetching and carrying water and wood, in addition to household chores, childcare and tending crops. Many are left to run farms alone while their husbands migrate in search of paid employment. This has not been a setback because Jeniffer has been making great profits in dairy farming. Eldoret is one of the places with conditions that favor horticulture farming:  good climate, soil, a transport system, and a market. Jeniffer has always wanted to diversify and start horticultural farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is the lack of funds. She is therefore requesting a loan to start horticultural farming. Through the Tuiya self-help group, whose members co-guarantee each other to secure a loan, Jeniffer joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports young and enterprising farmers. With this loan she intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers and potatoes. Proximity to an airstrip will allow her to transport the produce faster to an international market, enabling her to make more money. This loan will improve Jeniffer's living conditions and secure the future of her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":296.95,"image":{"id":1827466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-07T14:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-06T14:00:08Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeniffer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.41,"local_amount":6436.43,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6630.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265246},{"amount":68.08,"local_amount":6051.61,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:58Z","rounded_local_amount":6234.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459912},{"amount":71.45,"local_amount":6450.03,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":6644.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.11,"payment_id":696587998},{"amount":81.87,"local_amount":7458.07,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":7683.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.03,"payment_id":731023121}],"funded_date":"2015-03-11T00:00:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":849304,"name":"Mayra Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Mayra es una se\u00f1ora de 50 a\u00f1os que con esfuerzo d\u00eda a d\u00eda lucha para salir adelante.

Bartola quien instala su mesa, su vaporera y anafres, e ingredientes como crema, queso, verduras, salsa, elotes y esquites. Ella es mejor conocida por sus clientes como Barto.\n\nLos hijos de Barto le ayudan a transportar el material e ingredientes desde su casa hasta el parque y en ocasiones la acompa\u00f1an durante las ventas para que no est\u00e9 sola, ellos son la motivaci\u00f3n principal para seguir con su actividad. Barto siempre les menciona a sus peque\u00f1os que la mejor herencia que les puede dejar son sus estudios y que deben aprovechar esa oportunidad al m\u00e1ximo.\n\nDo\u00f1a Bartola est\u00e1 muy orgullosa con su puesto de antojitos mexicanos y para impulsarlo se ha unido al grupo Las Reynas ya que quiere invertir y comprar m\u00e1s ingredientes como elotes, mayonesa, queso, pasta de chicharrones, vasos, servilletas y picante en mayor cantidad ya que la fiesta del pueblo est\u00e1 pr\u00f3xima y quiere prepararse ya que es una buena oportunidad para vender m\u00e1s.

She is better-known by her customers as Barto.\r\n\r\nBarto's children help her transport the material and ingredients from her house to the park, and occasionally acocmpany her on sales so she's not alone. They are her main motivation for continuing her work. Barto is always telling her little ones that the best inheritance she can give them is their education, and that they should take maximum advantage of this.\r\n\r\nBartola is very proud of her offering of Mexican dishes and for getting together the Las Reynas group. Now she wants to invest and buy more ingredients like corn, mayonnaise, cheese, pasta, pork rinds, glasses, napkins and spices in a larger quantity, since the town festival is coming up and she wants to be prepared for a good opportunity to sell more.

She is married to Raul, a company driver and has five children, of whom two are already married, two are still in college, one is a high school student and the youngest is still at the elementary level. She manages their own household while doing buy and sell. She works to augment their income to support their daily needs and to send her four children to school.\r\n\r\nArlene has been into the buy and sell business for five years already. She buys dozens of various designs and colors of flips and sell them with a little profit. Flip flops have become popular and widely used also in the Philippines for their comfort and durability. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations and increase her sales, she is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan which she will use to buy additional products such as shoes, clothes, flip flops, and sandals to sell and to meet the advanced orders of her customers. This will definitely boost her earnings as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment and the financial help that will be extended to her, for it will surely help fund their everyday needs and support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nArlene dreams of opening a store to display her merchandise and attract more customers. She aims to send all her children to college to allow them better opportunities in life. She prays to continue to live a godly life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1827754,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

She is married to Vicente, a driver whose offspring are all married. She manages her household while operating a business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs.\r\n\r\nCerila operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food.  She earns income by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of 600 PHP a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a 11,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as canned goods, noodles, condiments, rice, soda and other grocery products. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given and for the good return on her investment, for it will surely help in their daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nCerila hopes to maintain and grow her business so she and her husband could have a more comfortable life and save for their old age. She prays for good health and long life and strives to be faithful to God.

Shazia's husband needs to buy scrap material in bulk to recycle it, but due to some financial constraints he is not in a suitable position to buy the scrap in bulk. Therefore, Shazia has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her husband to purchase the scrap material in bulk so that he can easily adopt the recycling procedure and earn a profitable income derived from his business. Shazia is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for this financial

Therefore she has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her to purchase the accessories listed above and will also help her to increase monthly sales and profit by providing better sewing services.

Due to insufficient financial means he is unable to do maintenance of his taxi. Therefore, Ghazala has applied for Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan Ghazala's husband can afford the maintenance cost easily.

Her husband has been running his own tailoring shop in the local market for 25 years. Her husband is only responsible to fulfill the needs of the entire family.\r\n\r\nZareena's husband needs to buy different types of tailoring accessories, e.g., pieces of clothes, laces, needles and sewing machine accessories. But due to some financial constraints, her husband is not in a suitable condition to buy the items listed above for his business purposes. Therefore Zareena has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan, she will financially assist her husband to buy these tailoring accessories to fulfill his business needs, so that he can earn a more profitable income. Zareena is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for this financial

Nargis's husband wants to purchase different kinds of commodities, e.g., rice, sugar, tea bags, milk and other consumer items for his business purposes. But due to financial constraints, her husband is not in a suitable position to buy all of the above products for reselling purposes. Therefore Nargis has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her husband to buy all of these commodities and will also help him to earn the maximum profitable income to manage his household and business.

In the same way, many people are self-employed by their own businesses in order to offer their loved ones better opportunities. The hope of having successful businesses is what drove the members of this group to choose the name that identifies them. The members of the group are:\r\n\r\nElvira \u2013 dessert sales\r\nCarolina \u2013 chicken sales\r\nSara \u2013 household products sales\r\nLuz and Silvia \u2013 mill services\r\nNicolasa  \u2013 plastic products sales\r\nAaron and Mayra \u2013 grocery sales\r\nCarmela \u2013 cosmetics sales\r\n\r\nCarolina keeps her chickens in a small pen, which is made of wood. She makes a living selling fresh chicken meat, and she has had more success raising the animals herself. Every day, she wakes up at 4 am to prepare and to have everything ready so that she can attend to her customers. She allows those she trusts to buy on credit. Neighbors have been buying meat from Carolina for the past 4 years. She decided to start this business in order to support her husband and especially for the benefit of her children.\r\n\r\nWith the loan that she has requested, she will buy 24 chickens as well as food for them in order to keep them in the best condition. Her short-term goal is to improve her small pen so that predators in the region, such as opossums and coyotes, do not hurt her chickens. \r\n\r\nIn the photograph, Carolina is the woman who is holding her small 1-year-old daughter.

She earns a minimum of 600 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 11,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy additional fish net to make more laundry brushes for sale. She is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment and the financial help that will be extended to her for it will surely help cover their daily sustenance and send her Elementary child to school.\r\n\r\nMilagros hopes to grow her business to have a better life and be able to send her Elementary child to College.

She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Due to some financial constraints, he is not in suitable condition to buy these items for his business. Therefore, Razia has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

Eliud is an industrious farmer living in Simai village, found in the North Rift area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nOn Eliud's farm, dairy and crops are products. His main income sources are from selling milk and maize. \r\n\r\nEliud is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to pay for farm inputs. Maize is a seasonal crop that requires heavy investment early on and brings rewards at the end of the season. \r\n\r\nEliud could use income from milk to bankroll these operations but not without neglecting the needs of his family. A loan will enable Eliud to pay for crop cultivation costs without denting his family's living standards. \r\n\r\nA fraction of income from milk sales will enable him to make initial repayments on his loan.
