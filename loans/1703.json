She started pursuing her passion in the year 2010. She is a hardworking and honest farmer who is based in Lolminingai, a remote village in the Nandihills area of Kenya. For the past five years, she has been making a small living through practicing mixed farming. \r\n\r\nHer primary source of income has been selling milk, maize and eggs to the nearby market. She also engages in a personal business, or \u201cside hustle\u201d as she likes to call it, to earn additional income. Rose passionately loves dairy farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is accessing funds to increase her business. Through Juhudi Kilimo, an organization that supports enterprising farmers, she acquired her first loan, which she used to buy an additional cow. She paid the loan back fully. She also benefited from training and the impact of the first loan cannot be underestimated. \r\n\r\nRose is seeking another loan from Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva lenders, to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. The cow she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 10-12 litres of milk a day. A litre of milk costs 50 KES. With this loan, Rose's life will change and she will be able to secure the future of her school-going children. She will also assure her ageing parents of a secure future.

She has a husband and a pretty daughter who is a year old. They live in the village Tsovagyugh in the Gegharkunik region. \r\n\r\nSince she got married so young, Versenik did not manage to have any other education after her school graduation. Now with her lovely husband, Varsenik takes care of the farm, which is a rather rich one: cows, calves, a heifer, a pig, sheep, lambs and chickens. Varsenik mentions that she works with great enthusiasm and very hard as she wants to have a bigger and richer farm, which will provide better living conditions for her young family. Their land is also rich with harvest which they use both for their family and for sale as well: they sell potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes and greens. Varsenik says that she has already been taught the skills of cheese making and, together with the sale of milk, meat and eggs, very soon she will also start the sale of cheese. \r\n\r\nVarsenik greatly hopes that Kiva lenders will help her family in their first steps establishing their farm. She plans to spend the loan on the purchase of a calf, a sheep and a lot of animal fodder for her farm cattle.

Meet Mary, 61 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Kabolebo, a remote village in Nandi Hills, Kenya. She is happily married and is blessed with 6 adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last 27 years and has gained a great deal of experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. \r\n\r\nTo make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Nandi hills area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the high demand. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry.\r\n\r\nBeing a woman and accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved and that she will be able to buy more poultry. As a result of the loan, she will sell more eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry market to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, change her living conditions, and secure the future of her grandchildren."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1827994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-08T06:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-07T06:40:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.37,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.11,"local_amount":2152.47,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2295.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265247},{"amount":21.39,"local_amount":1833.5,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1955.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459914},{"amount":52.6,"local_amount":4586.71,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4891.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.91,"payment_id":696588000},{"amount":243.53,"local_amount":21427.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:36Z","rounded_local_amount":22852.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.46,"payment_id":731023123}],"funded_date":"2015-03-23T14:24:48Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Bethany Katerberg","image":604977}},{"id":849631,"name":"Jamile","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jamile is a 45-year-old Lebanese married woman living with her husband and three school aged children.

Abraham is a 30-year-old farmer from Meguin in the North Rift area of Kenya. Abraham is chiefly a dairy farmer but he is also involved in other income generating opportunities around him. \r\n\r\nAs a dairy farmer, one of Abraham's challenges is getting his product from the farm to the distant Eldoret town market. To solve this problem, Abraham is seeking a loan of KES 60,000 to top up on his savings to buy a motorcycle.

But due to his unfavorable financial position her husband is not in a position to purchase fruit for his business purposes.\r\n\r\nTherefore Sabra has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner

She enjoys life and is grateful to have a roof to sleep under, food to enjoy, and two marvelous children. She is a woman from a community not known for farming but she is earning a living through agriculture (in Nandi community). She is happily married and together with her husband is blessed with a beautiful family.\r\n\r\nFor the past 13 years, she has been practicing mixed farming. Because of the experience she has, she commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers and is regarded as a mentor. Sales from milk and eggs have allowed her to earn a decent income. To make extra money, Elizabeth engages in a small personal business. \r\n\r\nElizabeth passionately loves dairy farming and the animals on her farm have been given names. Milking and feeding her cows makes her very proud. Through milk selling, she has had quite good returns and the demand for milk has been expanding. Demand has been overwhelming and she needs another cow to fully satisfy the demand.

Perisi works with a great deal of determination, for many hours, in her farm, all to bring decent food to her home and be her family\u2019s support. \r\n\r\nPerisi is blessed with a lovely family, and has been practicing mixed farming for the past 10 years. On her farm, she grows maize and keeps a dairy cow and poultry. She sells milk, eggs and maize. To meet her expenses and provide the best for her family, she also often engages in small personal business to make extra money. \r\n\r\nFarming gives her a great sense of satisfaction despite the low earnings. Peirsi said, \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge, however, is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. To a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. \r\n\r\nBecause of this challenge, Perisi formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports small rural farmers.

The \"exotic\" cow she will buy will produce between 8 and 10 liters of milk per day, and this will translate to more income and profits. The profits from milk selling will allow Eunice to grow her business further, by starting to package milk and by processing it into other dairy products. In addition, she will benefit from the organic manure from the cow. \r\n\r\nShe projects that she will be able to start a bio-gas plant at her farm, which will save her money in fuel costs.

Her family was her main motivation for starting to sell chicken three years ago. Day by day, Lidia got up very early to have everything ready and start selling at 7 AM.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Lidia sells snacks three days a week, an activity that has resulted in being more productive than the previous. During the sale days, from 8 AM to 4 PM the stove, comal [griddle], pan and all of the ingredients and the flavored water that Lidia sells are found under a blanket that she puts up to protect herself from the sun and rain. This time, Lidia will employ her loan to purchase oil, sugar, cheese, meat, vegetables and gas, being the supplies that she uses most in the preparation of the food.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoons, Lidia and her husband work planting corn and shucking it. Part of the harvest is for self-consumption and they sell the rest to the people of the community, exactly from their house to obtain a little extra money.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to all who have made our loans possible that have helped me to have my activities.\" In order to carry her food business forward, Lidia would love to establish herself in a point of sale in a few months.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken on the patio of Lidia's house, who is seen in a red blouse.

The 29-year-old mother is a small-holder farmer based in Koibatek village, in the North Rift region of Kenya. For the past 5 years, the secondary-educated entrepreneur has run a mixed farm, where she keeps productive dairy cows that produce milk for both consumption and sale. Mercy farms on a half-acre piece of land that belongs to her husband, whose professional activities have little to do with agriculture. Mercy was farming for subsistence, but recently switched to commercial production. The income she made from this transition greatly improved her income status and enabled her to afford her children a better education at standard private schools. \r\n\r\nMercy is seeking a loan to purchase animal feed. She places more premium on animal health and nutrition in her dairy business than on other factors. Animal feed has a lot to do with the proper composition of the animal products she sells to her customers. She is seeking this loan to ensure that her animals have the proper feed composition that they require. The returns from this investment will enable Mercy to pay for her children's education expenses.

Her projections are that, by the end of the year, these sheep will have given birth to at least four lambs. Through sheep-raising, she will be able to get sheep wool, which is very expensive and fetches good profits. This translates into more income and improved living conditions for her family. Also, she will be able to sell sheep meat and sheepskin, which will increase her income level.

Algunos de los habitantes a\u00fan hablan mazateco, lengua de la etnia ind\u00edgena que hace tiempo se asent\u00f3 en el lugar.

Para empezar, pidi\u00f3 apoyo a su esposo, el se\u00f1or Lucio; entre los dos limpiaron el espacio donde hoy en d\u00eda Chabe tiene su peque\u00f1o vivero que se mantiene lleno de color desde hace 10 a\u00f1os.

Some of the inhabitants still speak mazateco, the language of the indigenous people who settled in the region long ago. The legends of the origins of the community still persist, and they fill the new generations with pride.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group who work on their businesses day after day to put food on the table for their families and to offer them better opportunities are:\r\n\r\nSarahi \u2013 shoes by catalog \r\nMargarita \u2013 clothing \r\nIsabel \u2013 plants \r\nLuisa \u2013 food \r\nFidelina \u2013 snacks \r\n\r\nHer fascination with plants \u2013 the variety, the shapes of the flowers, the leaves, the colors \u2013 is what motivated Isabel who everybody knows as \"Chabe\" to start her business. To begin, she asked her husband Lucio for support. Between the two of them, the cleaned out the space where Chabe now has her small nursery, which has been full of color for the past 10 years. Nowadays, seeing his parents work on the small garden, their son also helps with weeding when he can between games. \"I am happy with my plants, and I invest a great amount of my time in them. I earn an income, and I help with household expenses. I feel useful, working honestly without forgetting about my family.\"\r\n\r\nIsabel's next challenge is selling at the village fair. In order to do this, she needs to have a greater variety of plants and to improve the infrastructure of her nursery. The loan that she is requesting will help her achieve this little by little, since she will buy fertilizer, plastic bags, and more plants. \"Not everyone has the hands to plant plants and have them 'stick',\" remarks Chabe, proud of her abilities.

It is a very small town where the Friendship Bridge's Artesanas Santa Catarina was formed by seven extraordinary craftswomen. Making handicrafts is the primary and most productive form of work for the women of Santa Catarina Palopo, a place where exquisite blue colours infuse the tones of the local typical clothing. These blue hues make the huipiles and cortes very distinctive throughout the region. \r\n\r\nThe leader of this group, Ana, is 37 years old and married with seven children. She never had a formal education. Nevertheless, she works the best she knows how at producing fine crafts. Since childhood, Ana has been making the traditional regional fabric and also has done painting. Over time, she opened up a shop in the center of town, where she sells many different local crafts.  \r\n\r\nAna is asking for a loan to buy a variety of fabrics, accessories and paintings to sell along with her own crafts. This will allow her to meet the higher demand that comes with summer time, which is rapidly approaching. \r\n\r\nAna and the other group members are very happy with the monthly meetings that the Trust Bank facilitator coordinates. These meetings include educational topics that are a part of Friendship Bridge's \"microcredit plus\" program, which gives women the opportunity to learn about self-esteem, medicinal plants and mental and preventative health. They also learn about business, such as budgeting, accounting, marketing and customer service -- all very important topics for the success of their businesses. Ana says that this program has helped improve the group\u2019s lifestyle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":1828408,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy a variety of fabrics, accessories and paintings to sell along with her own crafts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Catarina Polopo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-03-08T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-07T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":3600,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noemi Mercedes Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pedrina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petrona ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Estela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina Rosibel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":27300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3413.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3413.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3413.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3413.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3413.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3413.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3413.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3407.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450.09},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450.09},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":449.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":450.1,"local_amount":3413.2,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3433.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636216853},{"amount":450.09,"local_amount":3413.2,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3433.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649567055},{"amount":450.09,"local_amount":3413.2,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:18:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3433.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665049211},{"amount":450.09,"local_amount":3413.2,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:47:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3433.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347070},{"amount":450.09,"local_amount":3413.2,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:49:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3433.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696557427},{"amount":450.09,"local_amount":3413.2,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:38:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3433.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711472387},{"amount":450.09,"local_amount":3413.2,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3433.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730991474},{"amount":449.36,"local_amount":3407.6,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3427.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752079742}],"funded_date":"2015-03-11T01:02:41Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:14:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Pike","image":2004103}},{"id":849933,"name":"Sonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sonia is 31 years old and she lives with her parents in law Every tuesday and friday she goes to Desaguadero to buy women t shirts to sell them in many places and also she has a DVD store Sonia is a good business manager so she is asking a loan to open a liquor store because she thinks she has the chance to make more money and to improve the life quality of her family Sonia is the mother of 3 children","en":"Sonia is 31 years old and lives with her parents-in-law.

She is single, does not have children, and she works in fabric production.\r\n\r\nShe is sweet, sincere, sensitive, caring, friendly, responsible, and hardworking. She carries out her business as a street vendor in the July 16th area. The area is known for informal commerce, and is a place where one can find everything from a needle to sew to a tractor to plow. It has a cold, dry climate, with a temperature that varies throughout the day between 0\u00baC-16\u00baC [32\u00baF-60\u00baF]. The area is at an average altitude of 3800 meters above sea level.\r\n\r\nGabriela has dark skin; long, black hair that she wears tied back; brown eyes; a short stature; and a slender physique. Her native language is Aymar\u00e1, which is what she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish because of her commerce. She shares her life with her mother. They live in their own house, which is made of brick and cement and has a corrugated iron roof. The house has potable water, electricity, gas, and plumbing. \r\n\r\nHer business is the production of wool garments. Before, she only made wool sweatpants. With the prior loan that she obtained, she expanded her merchandise and started obtaining better income. With the extra income, she started studying sewing and dressmaking in a private institute. \u201cWith the Kiva loan I got before, I had good results and generated more income. I was able to join an institute. My studies leave me less time to sell, but since I am a street vendor, I put myself in good locations and I sell my garments quickly,\u201d she comments. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to increase her production, to hire weavers, and to expand her variety of products. She wants to buy a variety of wools on wholesale to be able to have a constant supply of working material and to improve the variety of what she offers. This is the second sequence of loans with the institution in the one year that she has been working in this occupation.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Gabriela is requesting a loan to buy a variety of wools on wholesale, in order to increase her production and continue studying.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1828329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy a variety of wools on wholesale, in order to increase her production and continue studying.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-08T20:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-07T20:20:09Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabriela Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":437.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":476.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":497.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":527.64},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":550.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":567.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":591.95},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":613.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":652.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":676.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":701.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":707.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.9},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.03},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.57},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.06},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.68},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.22,"local_amount":438.59,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":443.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214377},{"amount":69.72,"local_amount":476.17,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":481.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564503},{"amount":72.9,"local_amount":497.86,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":503.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046468},{"amount":77.26,"local_amount":527.64,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":533.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344289},{"amount":80.55,"local_amount":550.06,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":556.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554507},{"amount":83.1,"local_amount":567.5,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":574.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468620},{"amount":577.25,"local_amount":3942.18,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3988.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296483}],"funded_date":"2015-03-10T18:03:02Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cristina Bleicher","image":1721919}},{"id":850000,"name":"Rey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rey is 35 years old and lives in Butuay, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental.

He lives with his wife that takes care of household tasks and with his children that are not yet of school age. They live in their own home built of brick with a corrugated iron roof that has running water, electricity, gas and a sewage system. \r\n\r\nHis business involves selling stucco, which is a paste made of lime powder, powered marble, plaster, natural pigments, etc. The stucco hardens once mixed with water, and it is used to plaster walls and ceilings.

She has a 14 year old boy, and 3 daughters ages 4, 6 and 9 years old. Her business is selling staple foods in a neighborhood store. She is a good mother, enterprising, kind, generous, understanding, responsible, and hard working. She works in the \"kalajauira\" zone located in the northeastern part of the city. This is the largest zone in this municipality, with a cold and dry climate with a temperature that fluctuates from 2-16 degrees Celsius. Rosmery is dark skinned, she has dark eyes, short stature, with long braided black hair, she has a thin body built, and a traditional way of dressing (hat, shawl, big skirt.) Her native tongue is Aymara which she speaks with her family.  She speaks Spanish as a general practice and for business purposes. She shares her life with her partner, who travels frequently as an interstate driver, and with her children. The 3 older kids go to school, and the youngest is not of school age yet. They live in a rented home, built of brick and cement, with electricity and water supplied from a nearby pond, and no sewage. Her business is primarily selling staple foods such as bread, rice, sugar, sweets, juices, soda pop, and others. Her 9 year old daughter assists in the store, because she knows the products well and she is good with money. \"I work by myself because my husband travels constantly to another city driving a mini passenger bus,\" she states.

As an additional source of income for her family, she works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started this business in 1996 with 8,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nCurrently the farm brings in 12,000 som (KGS) per month on average, mainly from selling tasty milk of ecological quality. Saltanat currently has two cows at her farm. She also has 3.60 hectares of land, where she grows potatoes and alfalfa. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Saltanat turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) to purchase sheep and 2 tons of seed potatoes.

She is grateful to Kiva and to all those who helped her finance her loan. She currently has 2 dairy cows, 10 sheep and 10 horses on her farm. On a 4.0 hectare plot of land she grows wheat, barley and clover. With the income from her business, Toktobubu managed to buy a necessity for her farm - a cargo truck.

She does her business in the neighborhood of \"16 de julio\", an area known by its fair on Thursdays and Sundays, where one can find from a sewing needle to a tractor to cultivate the soil.

She wears traditional clothing (hat, shawl and skirt), and her native language is Aymara, which she speaks with her family. She speaks Spanish as general knowledge and in commerce. She lives with her children, who are independent and work. They live in their own house, made of brick and cement, with running water, electricity, gas and sewage. Her business is to make vicuna shawls. She started her business because of the need to support her children. Currently, she has constant wool providers and set customers. \"I learned to knit because of need. I have a fixed stall from where I sell and everything I knit is sold...\" she comments. Her dream is to expand her business and have a store where she can exhibit her fabrics. She wants to invest in her business through the purchase of vicuna wool at wholesale prices, in order to have constant work material and meet her pending orders.

Her husband is responsible for fulfilling the needs of entire family. \r\n\r\nHer husband needs to do maintenance on his taxi because the current condition of his taxi is not good. It requires more maintenance charges on a daily basis. Due to insufficient financial means, her husband is unable to perform maintenance on his taxi. Therefore Farzana has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan, Farzana's husband can afford the maintenance cost easily, and provide better transport facilities to earn a profitable income. Farzana  also plans to make savings with the profit of her husband's income to meet her family's needs in future. Farzana is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC

It is known for its traditional foods and for the production of jelly and cane syrup (derived from sugar cane) and also for its baked corn and yucca, such as sonso [yucca and cheese], sweet breads, arepas, cheese bread balls, and biscuits. Its people are heirs that specialize in handicrafts, especially ceramics. The town has a warm climate with a median temperature of 24 degrees Celsius. \r\n\r\nMirtha has dark complexion, long dark hair that she ties back, dark eyes, medium stature, and a strong build.

She has a small tailoring shop where she has sewn clothing for individuals for many years.  2 years ago, she also started selling ceviche made from sardines or pinchagua (a kind of small herring which is 12 centimeters long and full of bones), cut up and cooked with lemon.  She sells ceviche every day from 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. at a kiosk located in a very popular area where her sales are very good.  In the afternoon, she spends her time sewing and taking care of her children.  \r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy the principal ingredient of her ceviche, sardines, as well as other supplies (onions, lemon, etc.), and sewing materials.

Her husband is a master builder. Several years ago, she learned cutting and dressmaking at an academy in the city.  Towards the aim of earning her own income and profiting from her knowledge about tailoring, Zita set up a small sewing workshop in her home where she sews all kinds of clothing for women, men, and children, though she most enjoys making clothing for women and girls since there are more designs and she can learn even more through making them.  She works every day from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and sometimes even later when she has orders to fill.  \r\n\r\nShe will use this new loan to buy fabric and other sewing materials.

Her husband is responsible for fulfilling the needs of the entire family. Her husband needs to do maintenance on his taxi because the current condition of his taxi is not good, and it requires more maintenance charges on a daily basis. Due to insufficient financial means, her husband is unable to do the maintenance on his taxi. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Zareena has applied for a Kiva loan from Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan, Zareena's husband can afford the maintenance costs easily. He will then be able to provide better transport facilities to earn a profitable income. Zareena  also plans to make savings with the profits from her husband's income to meet her family's needs in the future.\r\n\r\nZareena is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC

Meet Evaline, a 24-year-old, very hardworking, honest, and ever-smiling mother. She lives in the lush hills of Nandihills, in the rift valley region of Kenya. Evaline passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past five years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding the large family she has requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her large family. \r\n\r\nIn farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. Evaline has identified a free space in her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices in the recent past have been going up, so Margaret, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learns that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nEvaline said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural-based loans and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo and from the training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. Evaline hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and  secure her future . She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1828588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-09T02:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-08T02:40:09Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.91,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evaline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1465},{"due_date":"2015-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1507.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1551.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1597.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1643.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1691.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1741.41},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1792.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1844.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1898.59},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1954.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2011.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.03},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.6},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.49,"local_amount":1696.69,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1873.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265253},{"amount":19.33,"local_amount":1600.17,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1766.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601391},{"amount":18.24,"local_amount":1510.21,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1667.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459926},{"amount":20.1,"local_amount":1681.97,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1856.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.21,"payment_id":681378305},{"amount":19.17,"local_amount":1615.47,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1783.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.34,"payment_id":696588011},{"amount":20.48,"local_amount":1777.26,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1962.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.98,"payment_id":711506285},{"amount":127.28,"local_amount":10818.23,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:39Z","rounded_local_amount":11943.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.38,"payment_id":731023135}],"funded_date":"2015-03-09T09:13:58Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":850148,"name":"Brian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Brian is a twenty-five-year-old married man without children.

Meet Jane, who is 35 years old, and is very hardworking, honest and humble. She hails from Nyamira, Kenya - an area that is blessed with elite and world renowned runners, and also the best weather patterns that favor farming activities. Jane is a proud mother of three children that she really loves and adores and will do anything in her power to always give them the best. She has been farming for the past 10 years and through these years she has always provided them with all the basic needs that they require. Jane practices mixed farming - that is crop and animal farming, and through these two she has been able to support her family, but she still faces challenges, which is why she wants to diversify and start poultry farming so that she can make ends meet. She is seeking a loan to buy poultry. She believes that through the increased income she will be able to comfortably take care of her family and assure her grandchildren-to-come of a secure future.

She has been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture since 1992, and this activity constitutes her family's main source of income.  She started in this business with an initial capital of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has four cows on her farm and she sells milk on a daily basis.  On 1.44 hectare of land, she also grows alfalfa which she sells and also stores as feed for her livestock in preparation for the winter.   In order to further develop her business, Kalemkan has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 25,000 som (KGS) to buy 100 bales of hay for her livestock.  This will allow her to keep her herd and to have healthy offsprings by the time spring comes in.  This loan will also help her to improve her family's well-being.  Kalemkan is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further grow her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1826301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy 100 bales of hay as feed for her livestock, in order to help bolster her income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chyrak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-03-09T05:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-08T05:20:04Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kalemkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-09T20:24:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":850190,"name":"Thoeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thoeun (pictured) is 59 years old.

She has a college education and by nature, she is friendly and responsible.  She has been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture for many years, two activities that constitute her family's main source of income.  She started in this business 20 years ago.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has four dairy cows, two young bulls, two heifers and two horses.  She also grows clover and strawberries on three hectares of land.  In order to further grow her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) to buy three cows.  She is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further expand her farming business.  In the future, she also wants to save enough money to treat her son to a lavish wedding ceremony.

He has a pensioner mother, a wife, a son and a daughter. \r\n\r\nThe family earns a living through agriculture. In particular, they own one dairy cow and a plot of agricultural land, where they harvest beans and maize. Badri realizes income from selling their agricultural products in the local market, and this is the main source of the family's income. His wife helps him greatly in his everyday activities related to agribusiness. \r\n\r\nHowever, the income is seasonal and the family requires a more stable source to cover all their basic needs. Badri needs financial support to purchase a stock of products and to have money for working capital in order to start a trading business with various kinds of shoes.

Meet Teresa who is a farming woman and a fighter, pushing ahead at age 60. She is a very hard-working and self-driven farmer who is based in Keera, a remote village in Nyamira. This region has harsh weather patterns, and poultry farming is the only profitable business venture that thrives. Teresa is happily married and blessed with two children. For the past 25 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been selling milk and crop farming. She passionately loves poultry farming. When asked what is most enjoyable about farming, her reply was \u201cselling eggs\u201d. Her biggest challenge is the lack of funds to increase her poultry farming. She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Poultry farming is the only business that thrives in the Nyamira area because of the harsh weather patterns, so she wants to take full advantage of the poultry business. Teresa is a member of Kiangoma self-help group and through the group, she has received training on financial management and saving. Through the loan, she will sell eggs to the local market and to her neighbors, hence improving her living conditions and getting out of the poverty situation she is in currently. Profits from the loan will be used in repaying back the loan and increasing her business.\r\nHelp out this heroine!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":97.41,"image":{"id":1828703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-09T09:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-08T09:40:04Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.87,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1061.59},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1092.62},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1124.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1157.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1191.21},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1226.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1261.89},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1298.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1336.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1375.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1416},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1457.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.12},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.9},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.05},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.67,"local_amount":2371.7,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2529.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601395},{"amount":26.16,"local_amount":2265.4,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2416.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.27,"payment_id":681378308},{"amount":27.54,"local_amount":2473.92,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2638.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.32,"payment_id":711506288},{"amount":14.17,"local_amount":1238.7,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1321.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"payment_id":752111277}],"funded_date":"2015-03-09T12:15:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kavita Shah","image":780734}},{"id":850228,"name":"Monica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Monica is a married woman.
