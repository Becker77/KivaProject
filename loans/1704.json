She generates a small income, and has a great desire somehow to increase her productivity. \r\n\r\nShe requested a loan from local financial institutions, but was rejected several times, as the creditors didn't find enough income to be sufficient to approve the loan. The startup loan program envisages provisions for business startups and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's poor people, who are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because they have a low income and do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Khatuna plans to purchase shares of the store where she works and will lead the business herself. She has already had loyal costumers among local people and passerby's as well, and has all the opportunity to make the business activity productive. \r\n\r\nThis hard-working woman relies on the goodwill of Kiva lenders, and will highly appreciate your support and kindness, as her income will significantly increase and Khatuna will get the chance to make a better style of life for her family.

While her community keeps cattle and poultry for food, she does the same on a greater scale in order to sell the surplus. \r\n\r\nPauline is seeking a loan to purchase a flock of hens. She will use the same technique she used to grow her dairy farm to grow her poultry farm. The flock of hens will lay eggs, half of which will be sold and the rest kept for hatching and family consumption. From the clutch of chicks, chick breeding will be conducted where female chicks will be kept, for they are destined to lay eggs for commercial purposes, while male chicks will be culled because they are more relevant to meat production. \r\n\r\nWith your investment, Pauline will be able to improve her family's livelihood by contributing to the income they generate.

The loan also helped her provide for their daily needs and expenditures.\r\n\r\nShe is very positive that she could improve her business more if you will let her borrow again an amount of 40,000 PHP. This new loan will go to additional grocery items, toiletries, and beverages which she sells. Simultaneously, she could sustain the needs of her family through the help of this assistance.\r\n\r\nSusan wants for her business to prosper and that her children will be able to finish their studies. She meets every week with her *co-fellowship members to share stories of her work and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1737852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items, toiletries, and beverages needed for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-03-09T13:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-08T13:20:03Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":246.68,"local_amount":10666.68,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":10871.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187168},{"amount":185.01,"local_amount":8000.01,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":8153.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536195},{"amount":308.33,"local_amount":13333.35,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:22Z","rounded_local_amount":13589.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017410},{"amount":184.98,"local_amount":7999.96,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":8153.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313828}],"funded_date":"2015-03-09T17:02:31Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":850269,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":373.34,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":["Youth","Start-Up","Arab Youth"],"use":"to buy supplies for his caf\u00e9, like tea and coffee.

His business is the production of  stucco.\r\n\r\nHe's a good father, enterprising, strong, decisive, responsible, and he works hard.\r\n\r\nHis business is located in Vichaya. This town, 86 kilometers away from the city, is known for its funerary towers visible on the land, called \"chullpares\", and for its defensives sites possibly dating back to 1100-1400 AD, the period of the \"Se\u00f1or\u00edos Aymaras\" [Aymar\u00e1 dominions]. These \"chullpas\" may be seen from the road. This is an area of cold, dry climate, with daytime temperatures ranging from five to 16 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nEugenio has a dark complexion, short black hair and brown eyes. He has short stature and a thin physique. His mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1 which is spoken in the area, and he speaks Spanish in the community and for commerce.\r\n\r\nHe shares his life with his wife who tends a neighborhood store, and with his children who go to school. They live in their own home built of adobe with a corrugated metal roof, with electricity and well water available. There is no sewage service in the area.\r\n\r\nHis business is the production of stucco: the native rock (gypsum) is treated to turn it into flexible paste that is mixed with water and applied to surfaces such as walls, ceilings and cements. It can be used to cover and resurface as finishing touches in construction.\r\n\r\n\"Our greatest challenge is the difficult access to water for working, we have to transport it from the river which is ten minutes away\", he comments. His dream is to sell the stucco wholesale and to have a pickup truck to transport it.\r\n\r\nEugenio wants to buy firewood and fuel for the production of stucco to sell wholesale.

Bubuzuura has a secondary education and has been involved in farming and animal husbandry for 16 years. Having started this business with 10,000 som (KGS), today, thanks to her hard work, Bubuzuura has 2.05 hectares of her own land, where she annually grows wheat and alfalfa for the farm consumption and sale. She also has 6 cows. Her monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS) primarily from sales of milk. This money is not enough for a decent life and agriculture is the sole source of income for her family. This is why, to further develop her business, Bubuzuura requested a loan in the amount of 35,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy 7 sheep. Bubuzuura wants to invest the earnings from the loan into increasing her livestock headcount, which will result in increased income in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1826355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase 7 sheep in order to increase her income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kabak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-03-09T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-08T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bubuzuura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":17500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-10T18:18:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":850343,"name":"Tonkei","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tonkei is 42 years old.

Her native tongue is Quechua, which she speaks at home, while she speaks Spanish in her business and for general interactions. \r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her partner, who sells vegetables. They live in their own home, which is built of brick and cement. It has electricity but no sewage system or potable water. They get their water from a tank truck, which comes by twice a week.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling locoto peppers, (from the Quechua rukutu or luqutu), the fruit of the genus Capsicum, used as a spicy condiment in Bolivian cuisine. Its color can vary from red to green, orange or yellow. It is sold in its natural state and also as a paste or powder. \r\n\r\nHer years of work have yielded results: she has been able to build her own brick and cement home, which consists of 2 rooms, one bathroom, a kitchen and a laundry room. It is in a rural area where most of the inhabitants get water from wells, using pumps and other less reliable methods. The water is reddish in color and it must be treated before drinking.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked ever since I was a child. My parents grow the locoto that I sell.

to acquire several loans to make good profits from her business. At the age of 51, she is helping her husband to provide for their daily needs. She was inspired to improve their lives because she wants to give her family the best for their future. She works hard each day, and she is quite sure that she is closer to reaching her goals.\r\n\r\nVivian owns a variety store. She believes that business is her stepping stone of making her dreams become reality. She knows how important it is for her neighbors and daily consumers to have a nearby store where they can buy a sachet of shampoo, a bar of soap, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, an egg, a toothpaste, or even an ice tube. She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price, and then she sells them, by the piece, for a higher price to make a profit.\r\n\r\nShe desires to manage a bigger store someday, so she is requesting an PHP 8,000 loan, which she will use to buy additional groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

Selling milk, eggs and vegetables has allowed her to earn a decent income. To make extra money, Teresiah also engages in a small personal business.\r\n\r\nTeresiah passionately loves dairy farming, and one of the animals on her farm has been given a nickname. Milking and feeding her cow makes her very proud. Through milk selling, she has had quite good returns, and the demand for milk has been expanding.\r\n\r\nBecause demand has been overwhelming, Teresiah is requesting a loan to buy a quality dairy cow, a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce 5-10 litres of rich, creamy milk daily. The increased milk production will result in more income, and Teresiah will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her school-going children.

She studied fashion design and then basic micro-business management. For this reason, she began at first working as a sales promoter, and during the nights she worked on design. This was how she began her business, when, with her own experience as an employee, she began the organization of her own sewing workshop, applying the administrative principles, techniques, and technologies learned at the university, in addition to being supported by her mother. Now Nayada offers her customers clothing in general for women, men, and infants, and she makes pretty costumes, products that have their highest sales peaks in the carnival season, and as they are of high quality and at affordable prices for the public, she manages to permanently win more customers.\r\n\r\nShe makes her sales for cash and on credit with biweekly payments. Her hours are from 9 in the morning to 8 at night. She makes her purchases for cash in the specialty stores that sell supplies for clothing and accessories. She proposes as a future goal to have a boutique and earn much more to be able to support the university education of her daughters, thus reinforcing their future success. \r\n\r\nShe is now applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing that she has had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy an industrial sewing machine, an overlock machine, and a coverstitch machine.

She makes a living baking cakes and pastries.\r\n\r\nShe is independent, hard-working, perseverant, very responsible, and a good mother. \r\n\r\nShe works at a market in the south. With a tropical climate and a temperature of 27 to 32 degrees Celsius (80 to 89 degrees Fahrenheit) all year round, the area is known for being nestled on the banks of a majestic river, for its traditional weekend strolls, for its rustic constructions made of local materials, and for being a place where people can savour traditional food and engage in sporting activities.  \r\n\r\nNieves is short with a heavy build. She has a tanned complexion, dark eyes, and dark long hair\u2014which she ties up. She dresses fashionably. Her mother tongue is Guarani, and she speaks Spanish for general knowledge and business purposes. (In the picture, she is the one sitting down, wearing black pants and a cream T-shirt).    \r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her son, who goes to school. They live in a rented house\u2014which is made of brick and concrete; has a corrugated iron roof; and is equipped with basic utilities (water, electricity, and a sewer system). \r\n\r\nBecause of her family and business needs, she formed a communal bank in order to apply for a loan that would help the members prosper in their business activities, which include servicing colour TVs, running a grocery store, running a butcher's shop, selling sandwiches, selling plaster handicrafts, selling beverages, and selling shoes.  \r\n\r\nShe makes a living baking and selling cakes and pastries. With a minimum investment, she started her business from her home selling traditional pastries such as \"cu\u00f1ap\u00e9\" (small bread roll made with cassava flour and cheese), \"empanada de arroz\" (baked rice and cheese turnover), \"empanada de jigote\" (thin pastry turnover made with wheat flour and filled with a mixture of meat or chicken and vegetables), \"bizcochos de trigo\" (wheat biscuits), and other products. She also bakes vanilla sponge cakes and chocolate cakes, whose ingredients are easy to find at the market.      \r\n\r\nAs she recoup her investment, she reinvested the profits in the sale of pastries. She says, \"Traditional pastries are part of the daily meal; local people eat them every day, and foreigners love them [\u2026]\"\r\n \r\nHer dream is to have a big bakery and sell wholesale. She also wants to buy an industrial oven and a propane tank to expand her business. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan cycle with the institution in the six years that she has been following this occupation.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Nieves is requesting a loan to buy different types of flour by the quintal in order to bake delicious cakes and pastries. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":1827592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy different types of flour by the quintal in order to bake delicious cakes and pastries.

She has four children, ages 7, 8, 12, and 15.  She's an enterprising, friendly, responsible, and hardworking woman and a good mother who's committed to her job.  Her business is selling staple food products in a neighborhood store.\n\nShe works in the Plan 3000 area of the city, known for being a booming production sector where microentrepreneurs from all fields--including tailoring, design, and handmade crafts--produce and offer all kinds of manufacturing that are sold in the main local markets.  It's the biggest neighborhood; the climate is warm and tropical with a temperature that varies between 18 and 35 degrees centigrade during the day.\n\nMery is short, dark, and stocky, and she has dark eyes and wears her long black hair tied back.  (She's the second from the right, wearing a blue blouse and black pants.)  Her native language is Guarani, which she speaks at home, and she speaks Spanish for cultural reasons and for business.  She lives with her partner, who earns a living in transportation, and her children, who attend school and play sports.  They live in their own house, which is made of brick and cement and has potable water, electricity, and a sewage system.\n\nHer need to support her family with the basic expenses led her to form a bank with people to request a loan and expand their business, which include a bakery, vegetable sales, spare parts, plastic sales, soft drink sales, appliance repair, and a butcher shop.\n\nHer business is selling food products such as bread, sugar, rice, pasta, water, and staples in her neighborhood store located in her home.  Because of customer demand for school supplies, she needs to buy notebooks, pencils, pens, rulers, and everything necessary for attending school.  \"My customers ask me for school supplies so their children can go to school, because there's no other store nearby,\" she said.  \n\nMery wants to buy school supplies to sell to her customers and increase her income.  This is her second loan sequence with the institution in the year she has been working in her business independently.\n\nHer dream is to expand her business and have it well stocked to attract more customers.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4250,"image":{"id":1828390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy school supplies to sell her customers and improve her income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-09T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-08T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":4250,"lender_count":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Selva Bolivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wendy Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marco Antoni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3058.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3320.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3441.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3696.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3831.04},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4114.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":448.21},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":486.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":504.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":522.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":561.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":603.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":448.21,"local_amount":3058.4,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3074.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214380},{"amount":486.63,"local_amount":3320.53,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3338.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564507},{"amount":504.35,"local_amount":3441.48,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3459.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046472},{"amount":1064.42,"local_amount":7263.06,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":7301.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344293},{"amount":561.45,"local_amount":3831.04,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3851.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554511},{"amount":581.88,"local_amount":3970.5,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3991.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468624},{"amount":603.06,"local_amount":4114.99,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4136.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296487}],"funded_date":"2015-03-23T19:58:55Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":847412,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy condiments.

To earn a decent living, she makes income selling milk, poultry, greens and engaging in numerous small personal businesses. Only recently, she started seeing how she could be making big money off cereal selling. She wants to sell cereals to the ready market that is in her region. However, her biggest challenge today is limited funds to expand. Jeniffer is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase cereal for resale. Future proceeds from the commercialization of her cereal selling business are already committed to pay for her children's education.

He has only a pensioner mother. Sadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Vugar was unable to study a professional career. \r\n\r\nHe works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing greens and tomatoes.

He is accompanied by his younger sister, who studies in school. His uncle lent him 2 rooms, one where he can live and the other one to use as a workshop.\r\n\r\nHis business is the manufacturing of hats. He learned this business in the neighbouring country of Argentina by putting together backpacks for long working days, with working hours of up to 16 hours per day. He then returned to his hometown of 'Batallas' to start his business. He had to move to the city to carry out his trade. \r\n\r\n\"I am a street seller, my clothes are easy to manage, and I sell everything I produce ...\" he says. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to increase production and hire employees, he wants to expand his business by purchasing fabric in bulk and a machine that cuts fabric so that he can increase his production and pay his sister's school fees. \r\n\r\nThis is the 1st time he asks for loan with the institution since the four years he has been working.

They do not have potable water or a sewage system.  To get water they go to the river, which is ten minutes away, and collect it in buckets.  All the family members participate in this work every day.  The people who live in the area wash their clothing in the river and many of them bathe there as well.  This same water is collected further down the river by other residents who boil the water and drink it. \u201cWe live in a remote area, and when we started building our house there was no water service.

Pazilat has secondary education. She gets very good feedback from her neighbors. They speak of her as a good and hardworking woman. \r\n\r\nAs a main source of income for her family, Pazilat has worked with field crop cultivation, livestock breeding and harvesting vegetables for selling for a period of 20 years. She has a plot of land of 4.0 hectares on her farm, where she grows haricots for selling. Such ecological and tasty products are in high demand. \r\n\r\nThanks to Pazilat's persistent work, her business brings in around 15,000 som (KGS) per month, which is the foundation for covering the family's food and household expenses. She also has 9 cows and 15 sheep on her farm.\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Pazilat turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) to purchase three horses. She plans to invest the income from the loan in further improving her business. She would also like purchase more land and marry away her children in the future.

is 47 years old, married and has four children. Nasira has secondary education and gets very good feedback from her neighbors. They speak about her as a responsible and hardworking woman. \r\n\r\nAs a main source of income for her family, Nasira has worked with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation for a period of 20 years. She has a plot of land of 2.5 hectares on her farm, where she grows clover and haricots for selling. These ecological and tasty products are in high demand.

people in the Nyamira area of Kenya. Daniel, the father of one, has overcome this challenge and has been practicing mixed farming for the past three years. His primary source of income has been selling eggs, milk and some personal business he engages in to supplement his meager income. \r\n\r\nDaniel passionately loves poultry farming and feeding his poultry makes him very proud. Waking up every day in the morning to collect eggs from his poultry makes him feel fulfilled. Although this humble father makes a profit through selling poultry, the biggest challenge he faces is meeting the demand of the market that is available. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Through Juhudi Kilimo, which is an institution that serves poor, small-landholding farmers, Daniel has acquired both financial and technical training. With the loan, he intends to increase his egg production from one crate a day to three crates a day. A crate of eggs goes for 450 KES, and with three crates, he will be making 1,350 KES per day. With the loan, he will be able to increase his income and move from subsistence to more commercial farming. With this loan, he will be able to improve his living conditions and enhance his food security and that of his community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":140.05,"image":{"id":1829420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy additional poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-10T05:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-09T05:20:05Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.77,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":14.83,"local_amount":1318.08,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1354.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601400},{"amount":14.75,"local_amount":1311.54,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1347.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459931},{"amount":18.67,"local_amount":1678.49,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1724.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.21,"payment_id":681378314},{"amount":16.18,"local_amount":1464.97,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.3,"payment_id":696588017},{"amount":17.43,"local_amount":1625.79,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1670.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.86,"payment_id":711506294},{"amount":36.37,"local_amount":3321.84,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3412.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1,"payment_id":731023142},{"amount":19.05,"local_amount":1728.81,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1775.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.4,"payment_id":752111283}],"funded_date":"2015-03-14T14:51:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":850700,"name":"Rowena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rowena is 27 years old and has three children.

He is blessed with a lovely family and has been doing mixed-farming for 5 years. His primary income sources are milk, eggs and earnings from side businesses. \r\n\r\nHillary enjoys milking. Milking to him is a hobby in itself. However, he has not been milking recently since his cow was pregnant. The cow delivered, but he is still sparing the milk for the calf. This whole situation has had an effect on his livelihood. His own family has not been getting much milk, and also his income has been cut. \r\n\r\nHillary is seeking a loan to purchase a highly productive dairy cow which will produce more milk every day than an average cow. This will get him back on his feet after months of low income. Having an additional cow will also cushion him against losses associated with such scenarios in the future. Returns from this investment will help him to meet some of the high farming-related costs. \r\n\r\nWhen he was asked how his family would benefit if he was granted this loan, he said, \"The loan will increase my number of dairy animals. I will use the returns to build a dairy unit that will boost my milk production. The extra income as a result of this loan will help me take better care of my family and meet their needs.\""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":224.91,"image":{"id":1829430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-10T07:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-09T07:20:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.38,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hillary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":26875,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1902.02},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1957.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2014.82},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2073.7},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2134.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2196.68},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2260.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2326.95},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2394.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2464.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2536.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2611.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.33,"local_amount":4687.76,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4778.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459932},{"amount":65.93,"local_amount":6015.31,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:02Z","rounded_local_amount":6131.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.22,"payment_id":696588018},{"amount":103.27,"local_amount":9444.62,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":9626.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.16,"payment_id":752111284}],"funded_date":"2015-03-19T10:06:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sally Otway","image":1443524}},{"id":850709,"name":"Gelly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gelly is 32 years old and married with two children.

She is still single and has been employed at a garment factory in Cavite for years now through the help of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nJocelyn is a clothing presser. She presses fabrics or garments during the production process (known as under-pressing) as well in the final stages of production (usually in a garment-finishing department). Sometimes, she helps in the sewing process and other production processes, if necessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Jocelyn is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses, and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Jocelyn is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in returning it back since the loan payment is being deducted every payday.  She looks forward to your positive response and any coming amount from you will surely be of great help. She will also use the loan to pay for the education of her siblings who are already studying in secondary school.\r\n\r\nJocelyn wants to operate her own business in the future. She hopes to give her siblings the best education possible. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1829475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for the educational expenses of her siblings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-03-10T14:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-09T14:40:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jocelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3666.66,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3672.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187177},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3666.66,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3672.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536204},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3666.66,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3672.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017419},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3666.66,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3672.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313837},{"amount":83.32,"local_amount":3666.66,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3672.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522586},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3666.7,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3672.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711432760}],"funded_date":"2015-03-10T17:22:00Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:33:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":850749,"name":"Jocelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nida finds pleasure in doing her vegetable gardening activities.
