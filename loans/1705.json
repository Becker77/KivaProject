She was able to take out successive loans of larger and larger size, which allowed her to develop a business where she sells electronic products and accessories such as radios, calculators and watches.\n\nWith this loan, Joeline would like to increase her working capital in order to purchase a large stock and be able to purchase her products at an advantageous time. In the long term, her objective is to construct her own

managing her time and being on her mixed farm. She is happily married and is blessed with three adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last 10 years and has gained much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Thika area is very populated and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Naomi's biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to expand her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 10,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nFor a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profits and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions.

Meet Peris, a farmer from Mosobeti, a remote village in Nyamira, Kenya, who has defied the common thinking among most Kenyans that agriculture is for the older generation. Peris practices agriculture with a difference, employing youthful energy, enthusiasm and knowledge from the many agricultural training seminars she has been attending to broaden her skills. Her primary source of income is milk, poultry and also she also engages in personal business and has been able to earn a handsome profit from the venture.<br \/><br \/>Although she earns handsome profits from farming, she faces one big challenge: the high prices being charged for fertilizers, seedlings and inputs by the only agro-vet shop in her area. The Mosobeti area has only one agro dealer catering to thousands of smallholder farmers who solely depend on him for agricultural inputs. The agro dealer has been making a killing from farmers by charging them extra amounts since he is the only agro dealer and enjoys a monopoly. Peris wants to change this. She is requesting a loan to start an agro-vet shop. Through your loan, Peris will be able to help the smallholder farmers in her area who for a long time have had a serious problem accessing affordable farm inputs. <br \/><br \/>Through your loan, Peris will be able to seize this business opportunity and tap into the potential agricultural market. She will transition from the peasant farmer she is right now to being a certified agro dealer who will be depended on by nearly 2,000 smallholder farmers in her area both for input, knowledge and information about improved inputs. Through increased income from the loan, Peris will improve her living conditions. Peris believes that there is no doubt that people like her can find rewarding employment in farming. She patiently waits for your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":361.45,"image":{"id":1829555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to invest in a business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, James\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 7.25 acres of land and purchase a total of 15 solar lights.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1800667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase two solar lights and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-03-11T06:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-10T06:00:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elly","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melksadek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sellah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Domitila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yusufu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nyongesa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lawrence","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":135550,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135550}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-08T12:33:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Richard Neuman","image":null}},{"id":851006,"name":"Seangly's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seangly\u2019s group live in a rural village in Prey Veng province in Cambodia.

It has a tropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 18 to 35 degrees Celsius. <br \/><br \/>Lenny is dark-skinned and has long black hair that she ties back, dark eyes and thin. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed  that she speaks in her family and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and for her business. (she is the first on the left, wearing a black blouse) <br \/><br \/>She shares her life with her partner who works making furniture and her children who study in school. They lives in a rented house that has water, electricity and sewage. Her need to improve her income by expanding her business led her to head a communal bank with businesses like selling jewellery, selling food, the sale of pillows, the sale of used clothing, selling potatoes, selling juice and the sales of gloves, to request a loan, expand their businesses and improve their income. <br \/><br \/>Her business is carpentry, a business where her husband does the labor and she takes care of sales. She goes through the center of the city with a chair or small table to exhibit it. Clients come up and ask the price and she lists it for a set of 6 or 12 chairs. Making the sale she directs them to the carpentry workshop where her partner is working. \"My business is working in a team. I am in charge of pricing and making the sale so they can go to the shop where my partner is. He gives them the furniture, which could be a bedroom set, dining room table, chairs...anything that can be made from wood...\" she comments. <br \/><br \/>Her dream is to open a furniture store to display the work, not having to walk around. She wants to make the purchase of wood to make furniture to fill orders. This is her second loan with the institution in the 16 years that she has done this work independently. For these reasons Lenny is requesting a loan to buy wood to fill the requests from customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":1830805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood to fill clients orders.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-11T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-10T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":2900,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valeria Victor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lenny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia Leidy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-09T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-23T04:00:00Z","amount":1506.35},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T04:00:00Z","amount":1533.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T04:00:00Z","amount":1561.68},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T04:00:00Z","amount":1590.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T04:00:00Z","amount":1619.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T04:00:00Z","amount":1648.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T04:00:00Z","amount":1678.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T04:00:00Z","amount":1709.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T04:00:00Z","amount":1740.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-29T04:00:00Z","amount":1771.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T04:00:00Z","amount":1804.09},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T04:00:00Z","amount":1836.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.57},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":261.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":667.26,"local_amount":4601.79,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4610.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214391},{"amount":465.33,"local_amount":3209.16,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3215.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564519},{"amount":482.41,"local_amount":3327.02,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046484},{"amount":757.06,"local_amount":5221.07,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5230.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344305},{"amount":527.94,"local_amount":3640.96,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3647.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554523}],"funded_date":"2015-03-11T21:34:15Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":851103,"name":"Tabriz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tabriz is 54-year-old married man.

She is married with six children, aged between two and 20 years. Four of them go to school. \r\n\r\nMarceline is a farmer and she has been growing maize for the past 21 years. Her husband is also a farmer. \r\n\r\nWith the loan from Kiva, she would like to pay workers who harvested her maize. With the profits from the business, she plans to pay her children's school fees and make some savings, as well.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). \r\n\r\nDespite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. \r\n\r\nUrwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.
