Since he started his business, he has opened two additional shops and hired nine employees. His long-term goal is to grow his business to include three more shops and employ nine more employees (2 employees per shop).   \n\nWhile happy with his initial success, Jack has realized that many of his customers cannot afford to pay upfront with cash. These same customers are often stuck spending $10-$15 per month - a considerable portion of their income - on lighting and phone charging. To break this cycle and provide renewable energy to these customers, Jack would like to start offering flexible payment terms to those customers who need it most, while also increasing his inventory on hand to serve more customers. He seeks support from Kiva lenders to make this happen.\n\nJack will use funds for 100 units of BrightBox solar kits, which will energize and empower households across Kenya. Customers will be able to collect BrightBox systems immediately and pay for them upfront or over several months. Since customers are currently spending money on polluting, unsafe, and inefficient energy, most will save enough to recoup costs in 4-5 months and never worry about fuel or fire again. With your help, Jack will help families eliminate energy expenses, improve safety, and allow their children to read into the night.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":8250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8250,"image":{"id":1831206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"To purchase solar kits to supply and empower rural communities without energy access","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":276,"posted_date":"2015-03-11T17:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-10T17:20:06Z","loan_amount":8250,"lender_count":191,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jack ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":8232.72,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":8250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1372.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1372.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1372.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1372.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1372.12},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1372.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1228.57,"local_amount":1226,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T16:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1228.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681497962},{"amount":1238.59,"local_amount":1236,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:15:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1238.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696704646},{"amount":1233.58,"local_amount":1231,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T17:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1233.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711636792},{"amount":2505.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2505.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731142016},{"amount":2044.01,"local_amount":2039.72,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-03T13:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2044.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752230732}],"funded_date":"2015-03-14T21:06:06Z","paid_date":"2015-12-03T13:11:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":851807,"name":"Manuel Arnoldo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Arnoldo, de 47 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio sexto grado, est\u00e1 casado y su pareja es comerciante en peque\u00f1o de productos de la canasta b\u00e1sicos; es padre de dos hijos y solo vive con su esposa y su hijo.\n\nArnoldo, se dedica desde 15 a\u00f1os a trabajar como motorista de transporte de carga pesada, aprendi\u00f3 este oficio en Estados Unidos, ya que estuvo 10 a\u00f1os en ese pa\u00eds, al venir al pa\u00eds nuevamente, compr\u00f3 su carro para trabajar, porque no encontr\u00f3 otra fuente de ingresos, antes solo trababa como jornalero.- El lugar a donde va hacer viajes es variable y casi siempre trabaja de las 6:00 de la ma\u00f1ana a 4:00 de la tarde.\n\nArnoldo, con el dinero del cr\u00e9dito comprar\u00e1 cerdos y materiales para construir una galera para mantener resguardados, comprar\u00e1 estos cerdos para que se reproduzcan y poder venderlos.\n\nLos sue\u00f1os se Arnoldo son que su hija se supere academicamente, tambien sue\u00f1a con ser un productor potencial de cerdos, con las ganancias que le genere este negocio, quiere ayudarle a su esposa, para que  aumente el inventario de su tienda.","en":"Arnoldo is 47 years old and left education after the sixth grade.

Aileen works as a seamstress, sewing clothing according to the company or client\u2019s dictates. She uses a sewing machine and other stitching machines as well as handstitches hems and linings.\n\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Aileen is meeting family expenses without access to savings or credit. Workers can become heavily indebted to money lenders who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. \n\nFor this reason Aileen is asking for your assistance to help her circumvent loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem in repaying them since the loan payments were automatically deducted from her paycheck. She is seeking a 10,000 PHP loan as payment for the ATM card that she pawned.\n\nAileen hopes to give her family a better life in the future. She looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. \n\nCCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force and equip them with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring the skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.\n\nCCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers such as Aileen before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and after-work hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1829486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

She has been doing housework since she was a young girl as her parents put her to work at other people's houses to earn money in order to buy food, clothes, and medicines. \r\n\r\nWith a great deal of effort, she was able to set up a small grocery store, which currently helps her to generate income for her and her family. She has been running this business for three years now, and, so far, profits have been good.\r\n\r\nThanks to the previous loan, Reina was able to buy the necessary items to stay in business.

She lives with her partner and has two daughters, ages 6 and 3. Her business is the sale of quinoa.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, independent, enterprising, tenacious, responsible and hardworking. She conducts her ambulatory business by going to the different markets around the city. The climate there is cold and dry, with the temperature varying during the day between 2 and 14 degrees centigrade, and it is located at an altitude of 4000 meters above sea level [approximately 13,000 feet].\r\n\r\nLourdes is dark-skinned, and wears her black hair tied back. She has brown eyes, and is short and strongly built. Her native tongue is Aymara, which she speaks at home and for business, and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture.\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her spouse, who is a salesman. They live in a home belonging to the family, built of brick and cement with a tin roof. It has potable water, electricity, gas and a sewage system. \r\n\r\nShe is in the business of selling quinoa. She travels to rural communities around the altiplano [high mountain plains] to find quinoa providers. She buys at wholesale to sell retail in markets and businesses. \r\n\r\n\u201cI started my business encouraged by my mother in law, who does the same. The only hard part is the long trips and transporting the quinoa\u2026\u201d she says. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a quinoa store. She hopes to grow her business by buying quinoa by the quintal to sell wholesale, and in this way generate a better profit. This is her first loan cycle in 2 years she has been doing this independently. \r\n\r\nThese are the reasons that Lourdes is seeking a loan to buy quinoa by the quintal to sell wholesale and improve her profits.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1830879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She is a farmer and she has been growing maize for five years, while her husband is a businessman. With the loan from Kiva, she would like to pay workers to harvest maize. The profits from the business will be used to pay school fees for her children and improve her family's welfare.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

A second Zafen loan will help the business supply more construction tools to clients, and experience revenue growth while creating two more part-time jobs. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":318.19,"image":{"id":1830106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":["Growing Businesses","Job Creation"],"use":"To purchase raw materials for construction  such as: plywood, metallic props, shelves etc\u2026","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HT","country":"Haiti","town":"Carrefour","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19 -72.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":380,"posted_date":"2015-03-11T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-10T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":3500,"lender_count":123,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kernida Shop","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":318.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318.18},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":318.19,"local_amount":318.19,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-28T12:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":318.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696557263}],"funded_date":"2015-03-18T15:16:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":851297,"name":"Emmanuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emmanuel is a carver from Ghana who specializes in hand-carved African masks and sculptures.

This is his story:<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I specialize in antiqued and shining art. I started craft work at a youthful age. I am very good at drawing and so, when I see objects carved out of wood, I am attracted to them. I realized I could use my own skills to create new and exciting designs that could be carved out of wood. I get my inspiration from my workers, when I see the joy with which they approach their work, and from the compliments I receive from customers on our designs. To be able to master this art, it takes obedience to learn, to focus and be alert anytime you are working. It also takes constant practice. My local communities make firewood from the scrap wood at my workplace. I also offer temporary jobs at my workshop to people in my community. The favorite thing about my art is the finishing, where I take my time to give each item a very beautiful finish. Working with these sharp tools can be dangerous, and that is what I find challenging. My hopes and dreams are to become an international exporter and a famous person in my locality.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I am very grateful to those of you who help fund my loan request.

In these communities, outside of subsistence farming and small scale animal husbandry and textile production, there are not many options to consistently provide for one\u2019s family. Compelled by the lack of financial opportunity in their communities, entrepreneurial women commute hours to reach larger markets, buying and selling produce, traditional textiles, and shoes. Taking advantage of the low farmer and producer prices in the world famous Chichicastenango market, the women are able to earn small profits by reselling the goods in outlying cities and communities. \r\n\t\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Mujeres Manzanitas\u201d is made up of 8 motivated and vibrant women. The Trust Bank is entering its second loan cycle with Friendship Bridge, and they are looking forward to continuing their success into 2016. \r\n\r\nElena, a 27-year-old mother of 2 young children and treasurer of the Trust Bank, is a dedicated and driven entrepreneur and member of the group. She is applying for a small loan to support and expand her shoe store that she has owned and operated for over 3 years. She plans to use the loan to keep up with the heavy demand for children\u2019s shoes driven by back-to-school purchases. Currently, she buys shoes at wholesale prices in the 2 biggest markets of the region, in San Francisco and Chichicastenango. With help from a local employee, she resells the shoes in a third city, out of her small storefront. \r\n\r\nWith her young children growing older and beginning to enter school, Elena is determined to continue expanding and developing her business. Her goal for the future is to generate more income to improve the lives of her children, by providing them with the opportunity to continue to go to school.\r\n\t\r\nWith the support of Kiva funders, Elena will have access to the capital she needs to maintain her small business and continue improving the lives of her family. Thank you, Kiva funders, for believing in the ability of Elena and the other 7 members of \u201cLas Mujeres Manzanitas\u201d to create a better future for their families and their communities with the

Gulmira has a secondary education and, to provide the primary income for her family, is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started this business 10 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulmira's hard work, today her farm contains 4 sheep, and she also grows barley. Her monthly income amounts to 12,000 som (KGS), but this money is catastrophically insufficient for a decent life. In order to further develop her business and increasing her income, Gulmira requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy sheep and increase her livestock headcount. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing her livestock quantities and save money to repair the space for her

50-year-old married woman, happy mother and grandmother. Bifotima has been involved in animal husbandry for over 30 years. She raises cattle on her plot of land. Bifotima makes kefir and sour-cream from the milk obtained from the cows and sells these products at a market. She also grows vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, cucumbers and tomatoes, on the field and takes them to a market for sale. Her daughter-in-law helps her with the business because Bifotima is of an elderly age and finds it difficult at times to take care of everything.

Only one of her children is enrolled in school. Sebastiana, along with her young family, works in textile production and creates children\u2019s printed tee-shirts. She is requesting funding to purchase a sewing machine, as she wants to increase production and decrease costs. Her family is quite excited about the possibility of this new machine. Sebastiana and her husband travel to the Mexican border to sell their tee-shirts and report that there is a lot of competition from sellers as well as demand from clients. Sebastiana has a long-range goal of building her own house and is working hard to make that a reality.\r\n\r\nSebastiana and her friends in the \u201cSendero de Luz\u201d Trust Bank express their appreciation to Kiva investors for their kindness and generosity.

who lives with her husband in the community of Solol\u00e1.  She is the second woman from the left with a purple shirt and black pants in the photo.  She is the friendly and responsible mother of a family who puts dedication and care into her work so that her family has everything that they need.  \r\n\r\nAracely has made a living raising chickens and selling eggs for 2 years, but in order to increase her income she also works as a cook at a school in the community.  She notes that this business is fairly profitable for her and her family since she has been able to support her family with it.  She has noticed that egg sales have gone fairly well but the chickens that she has are not producing enough to satisfy her customers at the moment.  Therefore, she thought of buying more laying hens, but one of her limitations is that she doesn't have enough money to buy them.  However, she is a very admirable woman, so in order to be able to access a loan she organized a group of women with the same needs to take out a loan to buy laying hens.  \r\n\r\nNothing is more important to the members of Aracely's group than family and therefore they hope to get a loan in order to make a good investment and improve their income in order to give their families a better life.  They also hope to start a traditional clothing business one day.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":849.44,"image":{"id":1830952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy laying hens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2015-03-12T01:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-11T01:00:10Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aracely ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selvia Bercely ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bacilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":8500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":708.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":708.34},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":708.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":708.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":708.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":708.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":708.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":708.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":708.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":708.34},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":708.34},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":708.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.76},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":821.78,"local_amount":6209,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":6265.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636134564},{"amount":27.66,"local_amount":209,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":210.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649489678}],"funded_date":"2015-03-12T13:09:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Swett","image":null}},{"id":851859,"name":"Mariano","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mariano tiene 44 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en casa propia de material r\u00fastico junto a su esposa y sus 03 hijos en el distrito de Querocotillo que se encuentra ubicado en la provincia de Cutervo, regi\u00f3n Cajamarca, en la sierra norte de Per\u00fa.

She is a mother who loves her work and for 10 years she has been generating income by selling natural medicines.  Abelina is extremely blessed because she has a great gift which is to be a mid-wife and she helps to save lives in her community.  For her, these two occupations are the most important.\r\n\r\nHer services as a mid-wife and as a healer have contributed to the development of the community.  The people who go to her are those most in need who do not have enough money to go to a doctor.  Her medicines, aside from their economical price, are quite effective.  Thus, people search her out more and more frequently, and so her products have become scarce.  It is for this reason that she needs to improve her supply of medicine in order to continue helping people.\r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties that Abelina has is that she does not have sufficient capital to make this investment. Thus, she has made the decision to ask for a loan that she will use to buy natural medicines that she can then sell at a fair price.  Her great desire is to be able to obtain the loan in order to continue helping people who are most in need.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1830956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural

According to what Antonio says, this job is not enough. For this reason and to improve his income, he also works as a daily laborer. He works in any type of job that requires his services. He assures that, thanks to these two activities, he has been able to move his family ahead.

He is from Cavite, Philippines and has a child. He is one of the beneficiaries of the employment program of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nErnesto works as an Assistant Production Line Leader. He conducts inspections and tests per control plan, work instructions and procedures. He maintains good housekeeping at all times in the respective working area. He is also responsible for a group of operators and carries out manpower utilization effectively to meet shipments.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Ernesto is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses. They have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Ernesto is asking for your assistance to prevent him from being exposed to loan sharks. He has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and he had no problem in repaying since the loan payment is deducted every payday. He looks forward to your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. He will use the loan to pay to retrieve the ATM card that he pawned.\r\n\r\nErnesto hopes that he will always be effective and efficient in the workplace. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work.\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1830354,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to redeem his pawned ATM card and avoid being indebted to loan sharks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-03-12T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-11T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ernesto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3863.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187181},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3863.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536208},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3863.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017423},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3863.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313841}],"funded_date":"2015-03-12T03:52:11Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":851769,"name":"Anargul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043b 22 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441\u044b\u043d, \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0435, \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044f \u0438 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u044b. \u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044c \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439, \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u0435\u0435 \u0435\u0436\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e 25,000 \u0441\u043e\u043c (KGS). \u0414\u043b\u044f \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430, \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043b \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a \u00ab\u0411\u0430\u0439 -

He is employed in a garment factory in Cavite through the auspices of the Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative (CCT). Danny Boy works as a tailor, sewing clothing according to the company or client\u2019s dictates. He uses a sewing machine and other stitching machines as well as hand-stitching hems and linings. One of the main dilemmas of employees like Danny Boy is meeting family expenses without access to savings or credit. Workers can become heavily indebted to money lenders who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Danny Boy is asking for your assistance to help him circumvent loan sharks. He has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem in repaying them since the loan payments were automatically deducted from his paycheck.

She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying since the loan payment is being deducted every payday. She looks forward for your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to pay for the ATM card that she pawned.\r\n\r\nMary Jane dreams to improve her present financial condition. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1830382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to redeem her pawned ATM card","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-03-12T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-11T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":4166.66,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4230.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187184},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":4166.66,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4230.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536211},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":4166.66,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4230.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017426},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":4166.66,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4230.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313844},{"amount":95.82,"local_amount":4166.66,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4230.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522590},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":4166.7,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4231.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711432768}],"funded_date":"2015-03-14T12:45:19Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:33:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":851451,"name":"Marilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilyn is a married woman with five children.

She is married to Jhones and they have children.  She has been employed in a garment factory in Cavite for years now with the help of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nRose Ann is a Sewing Assistant.  She helps the sewer or tailor in the production department and also does the sewing of clothing apparel according to the company or client\u2019s demands.  She sews clothing using a sewing machine or other stitching machine, or often hand stitches edges and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Rose Ann, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses, and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Rose Ann is asking for your assistance to prevent her from engaging with loan sharks.  She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem with repayment since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day.  She looks forward to your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help.  She will also use the loan to pay for housing expenses.\r\n\r\nRose Ann hopes to give her children a quality education.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1830378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to redeem the ATM card that she pawned.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-03-12T06:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-11T06:00:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4333.34,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4414.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187183},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4333.34,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4414.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536210},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4333.34,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4414.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017425},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4333.34,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4414.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313843},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4333.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4414.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522589},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4333.3,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4414.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711432766}],"funded_date":"2015-03-17T13:17:18Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:33:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mark McDermott","image":1404670}},{"id":851458,"name":"Nena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nena heads up for the next cropping season.

He has a two-year-old son who is cared for by the mother.  So that the family lacks for nothing, Santiago works with love and dedication to generate an income.  For eight years he has been buying and selling daily consumption goods in the village square.  This small business is his source of income, and he enjoys it because he is able to be in touch with many people.

The family lives in a very rural area of Mondulkiri province and has been growing cassava for more than five years. This is her family's main and only source of income.

is married, lives in the community of Solol\u00e1, is 34 years old, and has a lovely family with three children, of whom two are women and a one is a man, between the ages of 2 and 6. \r\n\r\nFor Venancia, there is nothing more important than her children, and it is to give them the best, that she works in two jobs. The first is that she has a small tortilla making business, in her house, since with the cleanliness and responsibility with which she makes the tortillas, she has managed to have customers satisfied with her work. But this income is not enough, so she also does domestic work with other people in her community where she washes dishes, does cleaning, and other things. Venancia says that this second job for her is fairly profitable since it helps her to increase her income and in this way give her family what they need, but Venancia is worried about the needs that her family has, and for this she now has realized that it is necessary to finish building her house, since it hasn't been finished for a long time, but one of the things that prevents Venancia from finishing its construction is that she doesn't have enough money to purchase the materials she needs. In order to achieve this goal, she has proposed working more to ask for a loan to use to purchase some materials such as cement, blocks, and sand to be able to finish the construction. \r\n\r\nFor Venancia, it is important to get the loan so that her family is more comfortable and to continue making improvements to her house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1831008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cement, blocks, and sand to finish building her house.

She directly supervises and coordinates the activities of production and operating workers, such as inspectors, precision workers, machine setters and operators, assemblers, fabricators, and plant and system operators.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Monaliza is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses. They have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Monaliza is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to any loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying since the loan payment was deducted every pay day. She looks forward for your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to pay her personal and household expenses.\r\n\r\nMonaliza only dreams to have sufficiency in her daily and become able to help more her family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.

They live in a rental house in the city of Ibarra, in the Los Ceibos sector.  In the sector where she lives, most people make a living through selling clothing and through tourism due to the Yahuarcocha lagoon.  The people are hospitable, friendly, and respectful.\r\n\r\nErika has made a living by embroidering clothing for ten years, during which she has come to demonstrate the responsibility she has for her work.  She has customers to whom she delivers her products, and customers who often visit and buy her products in large quantities.  It is for this reason that Erika asks for a loan to buy materials like wool in order to increase her production, offer more products, and continue maintaining her customers.  Thus she will be able to provide the best for her family, and to give her children an education so that in the future they become good people and continue educating themselves day by day.  \r\n\r\nShe is grateful to Fundacion Alternativa for the support they give her with the capital to continue growing her business and offering more products in the market."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":616.71,"image":{"id":1829081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy more material, increase production, and give her children an education.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Atuntaqui","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2015-03-12T13:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-11T13:40:07Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika Vanesaa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1104.69,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":86.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":87.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":89.35},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":91.43},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":96.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":98.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":99.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":102.69},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":105.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.31},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.22},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.58},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":73.65,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:41:25Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649568099},{"amount":85.65,"local_amount":84.1,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T12:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":85.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665436791},{"amount":88.36,"local_amount":86.76,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:50:47Z","rounded_local_amount":88.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347857},{"amount":87.34,"local_amount":85.76,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:53:03Z","rounded_local_amount":87.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696558253},{"amount":89.06,"local_amount":87.46,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":89.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711473191},{"amount":93.77,"local_amount":92.08,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":93.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730992224},{"amount":97.53,"local_amount":95.77,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":97.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752080521}],"funded_date":"2015-03-17T15:05:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":851502,"name":"Zaib Un Nisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zaib Un Nisa is a 35-year-old woman who lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, with her three children.

Juhudi Kilimo is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Kenyan farmers.\r\n\r\nMeet Joseph, an ever-smiling, hardworking and honest father who is 66 years of age. He hails from the Nkubu area of Kenya. He is the proud father of four lovely children. He loves and treasures his children and will go the extra mile to make sure that they are comfortable. Joseph's primary source of income has come from selling milk, crop farming, and poultry farming. Through these ventures he has been able to earn a decent income. He is a very determined and dedicated farmer who has been farming for 40 years, and throughout, he has never regretted going into farming. \r\n\r\nAlthough this humble dad has been making profits, not everything has been \u201ca bed of roses\". He faces financial challenges, and because the Nkubu area has proven a ready market for cereals, he is kindly seeking a loan to buy cereals for re-sale and thus improve his income. Joseph' upbringing was challenging, and he has faced many economic problems. Still, this ever-smiling dad has been making great improvements, and he believes that through your loan he will be able to realize his goal of improving his living conditions and transforming his life. \r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, Joseph has received training and he has proven to be honest and disciplined with finances. He intends to fully repay the loan with the profits from his business. Joseph is quite visionary and - with his accumulated profits - hopes he will be able to open a large cereal-selling shop that will boost his income and  turn his life around."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":143.8,"image":{"id":1830467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals for re-sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-12T14:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-11T14:00:07Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.9,"local_amount":1590.85,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1631.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265260},{"amount":18.67,"local_amount":1659.26,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1701.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601410},{"amount":17.3,"local_amount":1537.85,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1576.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459939},{"amount":17.1,"local_amount":1540.61,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1579.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.23,"payment_id":681378327},{"amount":17.79,"local_amount":1613.77,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1654.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.36,"payment_id":696588027},{"amount":18.14,"local_amount":1694.6,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1737.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.92,"payment_id":711506307},{"amount":34.61,"local_amount":3145.76,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3225.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.78,"payment_id":752111297}],"funded_date":"2015-03-17T19:48:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":851535,"name":"Julieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julieta is a married woman with five children.

She is from Cavite, Philippines, and she is one of the factory workers who benefits from CCT\u2019s employment assistance through Covenant Community Service Cooperative* and loan assistance through CCT Credit Cooperative.<br \/><br \/>Alma works as a garment manufacturing supervisor. She directly supervises and coordinates the activities of production and operating workers, such as inspectors, precision workers, machine setters and operators, assemblers, fabricators, and plant and system operators.<br \/><br \/>One of the main dilemmas of employees like Alma is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses, and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral.<br \/><br \/>For this reason, Alma is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to any loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative, and she had no problem in repaying, since the loan payment is being deducted every payday. <br \/><br \/>She looks forward to your positive response; any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to pay for educational expenses of her child who is graduating from college.<br \/><br \/>Alma dreams to become successful and hopes for her children to have a better future. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work.<br \/><br \/>* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.<br \/><br \/>** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line

She has a college education and is a schoolteacher. At the present time she also farms for additional income. She started doing this many years ago, and thanks to her hard work she currently has three cows. She grows rice to sell on a 1.0 hectare plot of land. Her monthly income is about 10,000 som (KGS). In order to expand her farm, Gulbarchyn applied for a loan of 15,000 som (KGS) with Bai-Tushum Bank to prepare the soil for planting crops. The loan will allow Gulbarchyn to expand her business and improve her family's living conditions.

Because of their situation, the family lives in poverty and requires financial support to earn enough income. \r\n\r\nNana requested a loan from local financial institutions several times to start a trading business, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time, because the creditors did not find the existing family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. Nana requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides leniency to the country's poor people, who, regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, do not have access to credit products. With the received credit, Nana will purchase clothing at wholesale prices and will sell in her community at higher prices. She will generate some money that will provide for their basic needs and create better living conditions for her daughter.\r\n \r\nShe awaits your support and will highly appreciate it.

resources and inequalities. This is true for Paul, who is based in the Siongiroi area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nPaul has been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years, and he has managed to earn a decent income. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business he engages in to make that extra coin. Paul enjoys the farming lifestyle. He has a connection with farm animals that goes deep, to the extent that he names each of them. \r\n\r\nHe has aspirations of expanding his dairy farm, but due to financial constraints, he has been unable to do so until now. Now Paul is kindly requesting 20,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) from Kiva lenders to buy a high yielding dairy cow. This cow will boost milk production on the farm. As a result, he will have more for both consumption and sales. With the money from the additional sales, he will be able to service his loan on time. \r\n\r\nWith increased income from the loan, Paul plans to cover the high farming costs of production. Many farmers compromise quality because of the high cost of inputs. However, with his increased income, Paul will not need to take such measures.

She is married to Orlando and they have children. She has been employed by a garment factory in Cavite for some years now, through the help of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work.  \r\n\r\nAnna Marie is a Sewing Assistant. She helps the sewer or tailor in the production department and also does the sewing of clothing apparel according to the company's or client\u2019s demands. She sews clothes using a sewing machine or other stitching machines, and often does hand stitching of edges and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Anna Marie is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses. They have no access to savings or credit, which puts them in a situation where they can become heavily indebted to usurious money lenders, who then capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Anna Marie is asking for your assistance to prevent her from getting involved with loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in returning the money, since the loan payment is deducted every pay day. \r\n\r\nShe looks forward to your positive response, and any forthcoming amount from you will surely be of great help. She will also use the loan to pay for the cost of house repairs.\r\n\r\nAnna Marie hopes that their present living conditions will improve in the future. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, provide quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1830583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay for the maintenance and repair of their house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-03-12T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-11T17:40:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2205.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187187},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2205.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536214},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2205.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017429},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2205.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313847}],"funded_date":"2015-03-12T18:36:22Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sally Otway","image":1443524}},{"id":851622,"name":"Soledad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soledad is a married woman with six children.

Over the years, he has come to like farming because it is a sustainable and self-fulfilling investment. Farming doesn\u2019t take all his time, so he is also able to attend to his \u201cside hustle\u201d job. A delicate balance of both jobs has enabled him to comfortably raise his four children. Douglas is seeking a loan to start banana farming. Nkubu area has a favorable weather pattern that supports banana farming. Selling the bananas will never be a problem because the Nkubu area has a ready market for bananas.
