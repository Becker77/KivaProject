He hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya, an area that is very fertile and has one of the best weather patterns on earth that favors farming. Erick is still young and has so much that he wants to achieve before hitting 40; that is why he is focused and dreaming of being successful. \r\n\r\nErick never got the chance to go to college because of a lack of money, but this never killed the zeal that he had for succeeding, and he started farming five years ago on a small plot of farmland given to him by his parents. Through hard work he has managed to practice crop farming and animal farming, and has managed to take care of his parents and also take care of his basic needs. Erick grows vegetables, fruits, and keeps dairy cows as a source of income. \r\n\r\nAlthough Erick has been making profits, he is challenged by timely delivery of products to the market. This has made his profits go down, because goods reach the market when they are not fresh and hence fetch lower prices. Erick comes from an area that has poor roads and this has been a major problem for him. That is why he is seeking a loan of 65,000 KES to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike, Erick will be able to transport his farm produce to the market and deliver it in a timely manner, and hence it will fetch higher prices. Vegetables, fruits and milk are perishable products and they require quick delivery to the market, so this motorbike will be of so much help. Through timely delivery of his product, Erick is sure of increased profits and this will translate to better living conditions and a secure future. \r\n\r\nErick is very ambitious and he is planning that once he has accumulated some profits, he will be able to go back to school. Through education he will be able to have a more secure future, because education is \u201cthe key to success.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1830736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Having known about the importance, your loan will be very useful to help Alfan improve his business and accordingly, his community who needs access to such services.  Alfan\u2019s goal towards Ruma in the near future is to add more services for his community, if the income capital is good enough to start another business.

The climate is humid and tropical, with a temperature between 21-35 degrees celsius. \r\n\r\nAlejandra is brown-skinned, medium height, with long brown hair. Her maternal language is Guaran\u00ed, she also speaks Spanish for her work (in the picture Alejandra is standing, second from the right, holding a baby).\r\n\r\nAlejandra's husband makes a living in construction. Her older child studies and the younger one is just a baby. They live in a rented house made from brick and cement with running water, electricity and sewerage. \r\n\r\nHer wishes for growing her business saw her create an institution with people running businesses such as: fried chicken, crockery, corner shop, cell-phones, llama-meat, flower-seller, clothes-repairs. The institution works together to get a loan and continue with their commercial activities. \r\n\r\nAlejandra's business is the sale of brand cosmetics, she does this on foot and with regular and casual customers. She started this work because of the need to work and look after her son at the same time. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to open a distribution store and invest in wholesale cosmetics, to be able to offer more variety and increase sales. This is the second loan for the institution in the year that they have been working together. Part of the loan goes to Alejandra to buy cosmetics wholesale in order to offer greater variety and use the benefits to pay for the costs of her newborn.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4900,"image":{"id":1832012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cosmetics wholesale in order to offer greater variety and use the benefits to pay for the costs of a new born.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-13T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-12T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":4900,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariyen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tathiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Willans Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":33500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-24T04:00:00Z","amount":2523.14},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":2569.06},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T04:00:00Z","amount":2615.82},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T04:00:00Z","amount":2663.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T04:00:00Z","amount":2711.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T04:00:00Z","amount":2761.26},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T04:00:00Z","amount":2811.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T04:00:00Z","amount":2862.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T04:00:00Z","amount":2914.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T04:00:00Z","amount":2967.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T04:00:00Z","amount":3021.85},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T04:00:00Z","amount":3076.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":369.06},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":382.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":389.57},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.89},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":426.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":434.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":442},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1127.44,"local_amount":7708.02,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":7734.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214392},{"amount":786.24,"local_amount":5375.32,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5393.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564523},{"amount":815.13,"local_amount":5572.77,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5591.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046488},{"amount":1279.16,"local_amount":8745.29,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":8775.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344309},{"amount":892.03,"local_amount":6098.6,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":6119.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554527}],"funded_date":"2015-03-17T14:23:03Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"CHEYNE B","image":null}},{"id":851766,"name":"Sharifah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sharifah lives in Kampala, Uganda.

She is a business minded and a diligent student who helps her parents meet their daily sustenance and fund her school requirements. \r\n\r\nJudy Ann is a coconut dealer. In the Philippines, coconuts are sold in the market or on the streets. Coconut vendors have a bolo knife, a shredder or scraper, and a pitcher that they use as they push their carts full of coconuts through the streets to peddle. One buko (coconut) usually costs 23 PHP to 25 PHP, juice and meat included. The coconuts are served in two ways: one end of it is cut with a straw in it, to serve as the container itself, or coconuts can be offered wherein the juice and the edible part of the coconut are put into a plastic bag with a straw. Regular customers are those who are thirsty and those who want to refresh themselves from the heat of the sun. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting 19,000 PHP loan to buy more sacks of coconuts to sell to her customers. Due to the tropical nature of the Philippines and the abundance of coconut in the country, Judy Ann is doing fine with what she earns, especially during the summer season. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP a day in sales. She thanks God and you for the financial help that will be extended to her.\r\n\r\nJudy Ann believes that her business will continue to be successful and hopes to buy a truck for her coconut business. She is positive that she will reach her dream to earn a College degree. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week where she finds strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1830845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy sacks of coconut to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-03-13T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-12T01:40:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judy Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120,"local_amount":5066.68,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5293.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187189},{"amount":150,"local_amount":6333.35,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6616.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536216},{"amount":120,"local_amount":5066.68,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":5293.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017431},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2533.29,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2646.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313849}],"funded_date":"2015-03-13T02:14:50Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iris Belen","image":697625}},{"id":851694,"name":"Gulbahor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulbahor is a brave woman.

This is his story:<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I express my creativity through my art, ceramics. My friends say that I'm a happy person, a jokester, and quite creative. I am a man of many convictions and I will defend them. People say of me that I am a good father, and that is what I value the most. In 1988 I started designing low temperature ceramics. I've had to learn and unlearn many things; not every experience is the same. I've experimented a lot, invented tools, made trials and performed many tests.\r\n\r\nI have a very close working relationship with my friend, ceramist Mariela Ticay, and we agreed that each one will sign the piece they painted, and we make decisions together. My inspiration comes from indigenous traditions and my country's natural beauty. I am also inspired by textile patterns that, when abstracted, transfer well to ceramics, thus creating something uniquely modern while remaining ethnic. Our workshop offers direct and indirect employment \u2013 a venture like ours is a vital source of work as it provides for many families.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nThanks, friends, for your support through this microcredit.

Due to the tropical nature of the Philippines, there is an abundance of these fruits, and as more and more people are becoming health conscious, the fruit shake business is a good venture. The combination of fruits makes it a favorite refreshing and yummy drink, both to the locals and foreigners, especially this summer season.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting for an PHP11,000 loan which she will use to buy mangoes, bananas, pineapples, and coconuts to make fruit shakes to sell at her fruit stand. \r\n\r\nShe earns a minimum of 600 a day in sales. She is thanking God for a good return on her investment, and the financial help that will be given her, for it will surely help fund their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nCatherine hopes that her business will continue to be successful to save for the education of her children. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week where she finds strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1831112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is married to Jenelyn and has two children who attend high school. He has a backyard business to provide for their daily personal and household needs and for the school requirements of his children.\r\n\r\nJoy has been a hog raiser for six years already. Investing in a piggery is a good and profitable business as female pigs conceive twice in a year and can produce as many as 12 piglets each time.  Aside from raising hogs, Joy, being a hardworking man, is also an Avon dealer.\r\n\r\nTo help him raise healthy hogs he is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan which he will use to buy more feed and clean grain and add piglets for sale. He is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on his healthy hogs and the financial help that will be given to him will surely help cover their daily living expenses. \r\n\r\nJoy aims to sustain and grow his piggery backyard business to have a better life. He strives hard to send his children to school to allow them better opportunities in life. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

In the future, she hopes that she can have her own stall for her clothing business. \r\n\r\nIn advance, Norma sincerely sends you her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance. \r\n\r\nNorma only wishes to be always healthy and efficient in everyday life. She meets with her co-fellowship members* every week to share stories of her work, and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1831186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To

Her husband needs to purchase different types of clothes in bulk for reselling purposes, but due to insufficient financial means, her husband is unable to purchase these clothes. Therefore Sarwar Bibi is applying for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can assist her husband in purchasing these clothes in bulk for his business. He can also increase the size of his business and earn maximum profit with the help of this loan amount. \r\n\r\nSarwar Bibi is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

Cambodia. \n\nShe has cultivated rice and fattened animals since 1990. \n\nHer husband (shown in the photo) is a 49-year-old construction worker, and her child works in a factory.  The family can make around 16 USD daily. \n\nPhally is applying for a loan and she will use it to buy construction materials to renovate her house.
