He was raised in the countryside and from a young age has been working in animal husbandry.  His father had a large farm where he raised cattle: cows, sheep, and goats.  Hamlet continues his father's business.  Hamlet also works as a taxi driver in the evenings in order to provide for his family and elderly parents.  He plans to purchase feed for his cattle, but he lacks sufficient funds.  For this reason Hamlet turned to MDO Arvand for financial support.  He is counting on a positive response from MDO Arvand.

Her husband is an employee at a gas station, located 1 kilometer of distance from her community. She has 2 children who attend school.\r\n\r\nDinora comes from farmer parents. In her youth, she did housework, until she met her husband. Currently, she works at taking care of the home. She spends time with an electric mill that she has at home.

Her husband is a driver and has a metalwork shop.\r\n\r\nLina, like many other people in the area try to contribute in some way or the other to supporting their households. She has a small chicken coop where  she raises chickens. She looks after them for three months and then sells them to individuals from her home. In this way she contributes something to supporting her family. Her husband uses part of the loan. He has a metalwork shop, and there he makes doors, windows and other metal structures. \r\n\r\nThe loans are very important for them, as this is how they can keep their businesses going, and each day improve their quality of life.  \r\nThey are very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir and to the people who help, so that they can obtain a loan and improve their lives.

lives in the small city of Isfara, located in northern Tajikistan.  She is 57 years old and married.  Her husband, like many Tajik citizens, is currently living and working abroad.  Muqaddas is the mother of two children.  She is involved in animal husbandry and she raises livestock at home.  She buys livestock, fattens her animals for a determined period of time and then resells them.

Here many people work in farming and breeding animals, allowing them to help their families to move forward. The \u201cSan Antonio de Higuer\u00f3n\u201d loan group meets in this town every fortnight.\r\n\r\nAnd it is here that 21-year-old Evelyn lives. She has a partner, a driver, but no children yet. Evelyn is studying at a further education establishment in the city.\r\n\r\nEvelyn works very hard in order to earn her own income and improve her everyday family and work life. She makes a living selling Avon (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes and women\u2019s accessories) informally at her school. She also sells in the local area when she is free, usually three or four days per week.  Evelyn sells on credit and collects payments every week. Thanks to this work, to loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir, and to people who support her, Evelyn is able to achieve her dreams of having a profession and, in the future, providing the children she hopes to have with a better life.\r\n\r\nEvelyn is applying for another loan so that she can take advantage of promotional offers at Avon and make a higher profit.

Her loan request was rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is her husband\u2019s salary. He works as a private artisan and generates approximately 300 GEL. It is hardly enough for food for a three-member family. \r\n\r\nAccording to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. Manana has requested a Credo loan for the start-up of an agricultural business. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nManana will place the purchased calves in an old cattle shed located in the family yard. She will raise them and, after 12 months, will start milking them. Manana will start production of cheese and she will sell it at the open market of the nearby town. As a result of the new business initiative, implemented with the assistance of Kiva, the income of the family will increase significantly. Manana will be able to create better living conditions for her family and will be very grateful for the help.

This first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn't previously have access to credit products because they have no credit history.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":207,"image":{"id":1831898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for livestock feed, and seeds and fertilizer for land cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Shenik village of Armavir region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2015-03-14T16:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-13T16:00:05Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anahit","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":40.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":41.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":41.14},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":42.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":42.56},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":42.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":44.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":45.31},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.64},{"due_date":"2016-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2016-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2016-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":47.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.49},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.14},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.85},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.31},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.64},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41,"local_amount":41,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T16:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681521339},{"amount":41,"local_amount":41,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-24T12:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696726914},{"amount":41,"local_amount":41,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-23T12:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711658385},{"amount":40.96,"local_amount":40.96,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":40.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731162754},{"amount":43.04,"local_amount":43.04,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:20:12Z","rounded_local_amount":43.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752250548}],"funded_date":"2015-03-23T19:01:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Peggy","image":1683516}},{"id":853194,"name":"Maribel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maribel es una mujer 22 a\u00f1os, vive con su pareja, tiene 1 hijo var\u00f3n de 1 a\u00f1o y una hija mujer de 3 meses, y su negocio es la venta de papa.\nElla es emprendedora, buena madre, independiente, activa, responsable y trabajadora.

Maribel is developing her business by selling from place to place in the town of Sacaba.

This area has a temperate climate, with a daytime temperature that varies between 9 and 24 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nMaribel has a dark complexion and long black hair that she wears in a ponytail. She has brown eyes, a short stature, and a slim build.  Her native language is Quechua, which she speaks in her home, and she also speaks Spanish in everyday life and in her business.  She shares her life with her partner, who works selling vegetables, and her two babies.  They live in their own home, which is not completely built, and is made of bricks and cement with a tin roof.  They have well water and electricity.  To extract the water they have to turn on the electric pump and pull the liquid up from the depths.  This water is not clean, and comes out earth-colored.  In order to drink it, it must be boiled and left to stand until the dirt settles at the bottom of the container.  \"I need to install potable water in my home so that my children can live in better conditions,\" she comments.

She will be able to purchase a trading kiosk, which she can use to serve her customers. She will also use the money to buy a mobile phone, which she will use to facilitate transactions. The other half of the funds will be used to serve her customers by providing the necessary funds needed for her to pay out for customers who need to receive money. \r\n\r\nBertha explains how running her own business will change her life. She says she will be able to take her children to better schools and support her relatives. She has six siblings and would like to be financially independent so that she can send money back home. This prospect excites her, and she cannot wait to begin operating her very own Zoona mobile money outlet. She thanks the Kiva lenders for their support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":87.62,"image":{"id":1830253,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology"],"use":"to purchase a trading kiosk and a mobile phone and access the capital float needed for her to serve people who need financial services ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MW","country":"Malawi","town":"Mchinji","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.5 34","type":"point"}},"partner_id":444,"posted_date":"2015-03-14T17:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-13T17:40:11Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.85,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MWK","disbursal_amount":639500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":24,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18676.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18676.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":18676.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":18676.47},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":18676.47},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":18676.47},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":18676.47},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18676.47},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18676.47},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18676.47},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18676.47},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18676.47},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18676.47},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18676.47},{"due_date":"2016-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18676.42},{"due_date":"2016-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":18676},{"due_date":"2017-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":18677},{"due_date":"2017-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":322000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":755.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.15,"local_amount":18676.47,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T18:09:29Z","rounded_local_amount":18725.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.66,"payment_id":731214690},{"amount":36.62,"local_amount":18676.47,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":18725.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.19,"payment_id":752301928}],"funded_date":"2015-03-17T18:34:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":852425,"name":"Kabila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kabila is 39 years old.

He lives with his wife and their three children in Chinteche, Malawi. All his children go to school. \r\n\r\nKizito is requesting a loan in order to start running his own Zoona mobile money transfer business in his hometown of Chintenche.\r\n\r\nKizito has successfully completed training with Zoona to set up his own kiosk as a mobile money transfer agent.  This means that Kizito will provide the service of mobile money transfers and earn profit from the business every time a customer sends and receives money from his kiosk. He is very excited about the prospect of running his own business and earning money, as this will help him provide for his family.\r\n\r\nKizito\u2019s community does not have a bank. They rely on a mobile truck that comes to the small town two times a week to provide them with their banking needs. This makes it very difficult for people to make day-to-day transactions. Kizito is excited to open a Zoona mobile money transfer business because it will help his community move their monies in a safe and convenient manner. He says his community will benefit because they will not have to go to the next town to transact on a daily basis, as the service will now be on their doorstep.\r\n\r\nZoona has done extensive research in Kizito\u2019s community and has determined that the location for the mobile money transfer business is ideal. The closest bank is about 79km away in a town called Mzuzu, and most clients rely on the mobile truck, which comes twice weekly. Since most clients walk or use their bicycles to travel, it is certain they will prefer to use Kizito\u2019s mobile money transfer kiosk rather than traveling a longer distance and waiting for the specific banking days. \r\n\r\nThis loan will help Kizito start his own business, with the loan, he will be able to purchase the equipment needed for him to run the mobile money transfer business. He will purchase a trading kiosk where he will serve his customers, and an Internet enabled phone, which he will use to transact. This loan will also insure that Kizito has a basic float for him to serve his customers.\r\n\r\nKizito would like to thank the Kiva lenders for the opportunity to run his own business. He is hopeful that by earning some money, he can improve his family\u2019s standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":63.24,"image":{"id":1829821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology"],"use":"to purchase the equipment such as a trading kiosk, phone, cashbox and float ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MW","country":"Malawi","town":"Chinteche","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.5 34","type":"point"}},"partner_id":444,"posted_date":"2015-03-14T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-13T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kizito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MWK","disbursal_amount":549000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":24,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2016-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2016-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":13353},{"due_date":"2017-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":13352},{"due_date":"2017-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":322000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.61},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.81,"local_amount":13353,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T18:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":13515.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.81,"payment_id":731214701},{"amount":26.43,"local_amount":13353,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":13515.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.19,"payment_id":752301939}],"funded_date":"2015-03-21T12:14:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":852456,"name":"Bornface","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bornface is an emerging entrepreneur, aged 24.

He is 22 years old and lives with his parents in a household of five in Blantyre, Malawi. Godfrey completed training with Zoona and is requesting a loan to start running his own Zoona mobile money transfer business in Blantyre. His business will service people in his community who need access to financial services. Godfrey is happy for the opportunity to be connected to Kiva lenders through Zoona. He explains that getting a loan in Malawi is not easy, as they require collateral. He hopes that being connected to the Kiva lenders will help his dream of becoming an entrepreneur become a reality. <br \/><br \/>Godfrey has requested a loan to access the working capital he needs to get his Zoona business off the ground and start serving his community. With this loan, he will pay for his setup costs, which include buying a branded trading kiosk, framed fee posters, some uniforms, an Internet-enabled mobile phone, a cashbox and a chair.

Today he is married and the father of four children, three of them in school and the youngest just two years old. Jos\u00e9's wife cares for the children and manages the household. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 currently works for a construction company, working on road repair projects across El Salvador and earning a monthly salary. He also grows a variety of crops during part of the year, such as sorghum, corn, beans, and other vegetables. Farming is thus a source of both food and additional income for Jos\u00e9 and his family. The plot of land that Jos\u00e9 farms is near the family's home, but the road repair work can take him very far away.   \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is applying for a loan for the purchase of a cow because he always has excess crops from the harvest that could serve as animal feed. Jos\u00e9 thus already has a food supply for an animal that could provide an additional source of income for his family. Managing a small farm and raising a cow are small businesses Jos\u00e9, his wife, and their children can easily manage. \r\n\r\nObtaining this loan and purchasing a cow would have many results for Jos\u00e9, but his top priority is boosting his income. One way to do that is to diversify his business activity. The family's home is made of clay and uncomfortable during the rainy season, so Jos\u00e9 would like to renovate the house with stronger materials. He also wants to provide for his children's education and motivate them to study so that they'll have stable jobs when they grow up.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1602732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-03-14T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-13T20:00:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Toribio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-19T13:53:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephen Volante","image":1247673}},{"id":852481,"name":"Bendera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bendera is a married woman and she has four children, all of whom attend school.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions.

The disadvantage is that it is in a distant location and to stock her business, she has to go a long distance. \"I began my business because a neighbor was the owner of the store and for reasons of travel, she gave it to me. I added a number of small things and the business is going well...\" she says. Her dream is to strengthen her store and improve it until it becomes a micromarket.

She lives with her mom, her younger sister and her brother.  Her brother, however, is currently making a living abroad.  Although she is still very young, Gulnora has already gone through a divorce with her husband.  Of course she had a very difficult time going through this period of her life.  However, she decided to take things in her own hands and to start a new life and start working.  Gulnora is now a professional seamstress.  She learned this trade from her grandmother.  After she started her own business, her life started to improve.



Hamziya works as a preschool teacher and loves her job.  For her, working with children is a real pleasure and she considers herself very lucky to have such a job.  When she is not working, Hamziya spends her time at her sewing machine.  She loves sewing and she has been teaching this activity to her daughter as well.  Her daughter is learning very fast, and would like to become a professional seamstress.  Hamziya fully supports her with this decision.  Hamziya could give her own sewing machine to her daughter but, since her daughter will be taking orders from her customers, she needs a professional sewing machine that will allow her to work very fast.  Hamziya is supporting her daughter and wants to see her start her own business, so that she can make a living and start being financially stable.

Su negocio lo desarrolla en la zona \u2018San Mart\u00edn\u2019  un \u00e1rea recientemente poblada, calles de tierra y vientos helados son el diario vivir, de clima frio y seco con una temperatura ambiente que var\u00eda durante el d\u00eda entre 0-12 grados cent\u00edgrados.\nVirginia es de piel morena, cabello negro largo lo usa trenzado, ojos obscuros, baja estatura, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica robusta, su forma de vestir es tradicional (sombrero, manta y pollera), y su lengua materna es el Aymar\u00e1 que habla en familia y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y por el negocio que realiza.

Her business is located in the San Martin district, a recently inhabited area, dirt roads and icy winds are daily life in this cold, dry climate with an ambient temperature varying during the day from 0-12 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nVirginia has a dark complexion, long black hair in braids, dark eyes, short stature, a strong build, she dresses in the traditional way (hat, shawl, pollera skirt). Her mother tongue is Aymara which she speaks at home and she speaks Spanish for everyday use and for business. She spends her life with her partner who works in construction and their children. Her eldest daughter goes to school but the two younger ones aren't old enough to go to school yet. They live in their own brick and cement home with an iron roof which has drinkable water and electricity but isn't connected to the sewerage system.\r\n\r\nHer business is sewing enaguas, which are thin, soft skirts used as innerwear - over the underwear but under pollera skirts to help them hang smoothly and prevent the fabric irritating the skin. This work is done by hand and they are worn by women who wear traditional clothing.\r\n\r\n\"I started my business working for my aunt, then I went independent and how I work alone from home,\" she says. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she can take care of her children while she sews, the disadvantage is that her customers are wearing more dresses than pollera skirts, which reduces her customers. Her dream is to open a store selling enagua underskirts and pollera skirts, she wants to purchase fabric wholesale and convert a room of her home to use it as a dressmaking workroom. This is her 1st loan cycle with the institution in 5 years that she has been in this line of work independently\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons that Virginia is requesting a loan to buy fabric wholesale and convert a room into a dressmaking workroom, to open a pollera store."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":615.68,"image":{"id":1832990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric wholesale and convert a room into a sewing workroom.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-15T01:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-14T01:20:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T04:00:00Z","amount":69.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T04:00:00Z","amount":67.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T04:00:00Z","amount":73.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T04:00:00Z","amount":74.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T04:00:00Z","amount":77.43},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T04:00:00Z","amount":81.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T04:00:00Z","amount":82.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":89},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T04:00:00Z","amount":90.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T04:00:00Z","amount":94.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T04:00:00Z","amount":98.7},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T04:00:00Z","amount":100.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.43},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.02},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.7},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.69,"local_amount":70.69,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:31:12Z","rounded_local_amount":70.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214398},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:29Z","rounded_local_amount":66.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564531},{"amount":73.7,"local_amount":73.7,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":73.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046496},{"amount":74.43,"local_amount":74.43,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":74.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344316},{"amount":77.43,"local_amount":77.43,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":77.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554534},{"amount":81.38,"local_amount":81.38,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":81.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468642},{"amount":82.38,"local_amount":82.38,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":82.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296504},{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076737}],"funded_date":"2015-03-16T23:59:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joelle Kuiper","image":1765797}},{"id":852755,"name":"Lilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilia is married and has a buy and sell rice business in the Philippines.
