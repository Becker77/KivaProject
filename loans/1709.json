married for one year and has a 6 month old son. Currently he lives in the home of his boss. Willian works as a ranch hand. He is responsible for feeding the cattle, keeping them in order and being aware of the surroundings so they stay in good shape and don't get out and mess up bordering property. Willian learned this work from the age of 12; he didn't give much importance to it until his uncle, whom he had learned from, died. That's when he realized that he had inherited something valuable that could serve him all his life.

is a very hard-working, independent, and responsible young woman.  She has two children.  One of them is six years old, and the other is a one year old baby.  She lives with her life partner.  Out of love and being together, they made the decision to be together even when it went against her family.  They love each other, and together they work in different fields in order to bring sustenance to their household.\r\n\r\nFor her part Maira sells \u2018bolis y cremas\u2019.  In a few words, it is a flavored liquid like chocolate, green mango, blackberry, passion fruit, or \u2018lulo\u2019 [exotic fruit with citrus flavor] in a plastic bag, which is then frozen.  She has this business at her house.  This way she is able to take care of her little ones who are still very young.\r\n\r\nHer immediate concern is being able to have the capital to pay for her children\u2019s education.  Even though she knows that she could get a job, she prefers to stay at home and raise her two little ones in a good way.\r\n\r\nMaira is requesting a loan to have working capital to buy the supplies she needs.  At this time she needs molds to sell creams, plastic bags to package them, and stock of fruit and milk to make her frozen products.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":379.1,"image":{"id":1830979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy plastic bags, fruit, and milk to make 'cremas y bolis' [frozen flavored milk].

She is married and the couple is determined to work hard to provide for their family.\r\n\r\nWhat she basically does is buy processed meat products from wholesalers. Then, she sells them per piece or pack with a profit. Products can range from ham, hot dogs, processed pork, and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low-selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nFlordeliza is taking out a 17,000 PHP loan to buy additional frozen food products and orders for her customers. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more processed meats and direct-selling products which are necessary to increase her inventory.\r\n\r\nFlordeliza hopes that her business will grow and continue to flourish. She also wants her children to have good lives in the future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1832484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy additional frozen products and merchandise items to resell ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-03-15T14:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-14T14:40:05Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flordeliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.35,"local_amount":5666.65,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5903.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187203},{"amount":106.68,"local_amount":4533.32,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4723.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536230},{"amount":106.64,"local_amount":4533.32,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4723.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017445},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2266.71,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2361.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313862}],"funded_date":"2015-03-15T18:09:16Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Kuperberg","image":null}},{"id":852888,"name":"Ailyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ailyn is 28 years old and married with two children, one of whom is in school.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to invest in a business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Stephen\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 4.75 acres of land and purchase a total of 8 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1800831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-03-15T19:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-14T19:40:04Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hassan W","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatila","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Athuman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matete","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mwanahawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sheila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":83670,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83670}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-14T14:11:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":853044,"name":"Tea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tea is a 26-year-old married woman from the capital of Georgia.

According to the above-mentioned situation, Tea lacks the access to capital markets and financial institutions to obtain credit for starting a business, as they require stable income and business experience.  The Start Up program created by Kiva and Credo enabled Tea to get a loan of 700 USD and start her own business.  She will purchase a stock of merchandise and have money for working capital for opening a bakery. She will rent the space that she has already found and will start working herself. \r\n\r\nTea thinks that the business will be profitable, as it is in a great location and the only business of this kind in the area. After the bakery is opened, the family will have a stable income, which enables them to cover everyday costs as well as expand the business in the future.

According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nVenera has requested a Credo loan to open a bakery. Her loan request was approved in the framewor of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions for the country's poor people, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nVenera will purchase all equipment and will start baking traditional Georgian bread.

She goes to Turkey and generates a small income there. In order to make income in her country, Tekla decided to purchase furniture for her house and rent it seasonally. The city where she lives is one of the most popular resorts in the country and she will always have her own clients, especially during the season. All the financial institutions rejected her loan requests because of her unstable financial condition and lack of experience.

Her request was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the poor people to start or re-start businesses.\r\n \r\nThe Start Up credit will be a great support for the family, as her income will be significantly increased thanks to Kiva lenders and Tekla will tackle the financial difficulties.

Here she currently doesn't have any place for her business, nor enough goods. You can see the goods she has on the photo, on the window sill. The window sill is also where she currently sells from. Her customers are mainly her neighbors. The sales process is currently like this: Her customers comes to their home, knocks on the window and Nasiba sells them the products needed from there. \r\n\r\nNasiba applied for a loan in order to purchase goods for selling and stepwise save money and open her own store.

He will use the capital to process more mobile airtime credits for his communities, so they can easily connect with their loved ones, no matter how far apart they are. \r\n\r\nNow that lenders know about the importance, their loans will be very useful to help Mursidi improve his business, and as a result help his community which needs access to such services. \r\n\r\nMursidi\u2019s goal towards Ruma in the near future is to serve an e-commerce business for his customers.

Sometimes there are wholesale buyers from other towns and cities who come to buy their fish. With their savings, they welcome the idea of expanding their business.  They have requested from Paglaum MPC a loan of 4,000 PHP to buy fish floaters and nets for fishing.  They feel assured of Paglaum\u2019s help, should there be a need for working capital in the future. Elisa smiles at the thought of seeing their grandchildren get their own diplomas one day."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1832547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fish floaters and nets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Calamba -

I began working in other people's workshops and sold my ceramics very cheaply so I could buy the tools and materials I needed. I didn't have much experience, so my friends or uncles would give me a hand with designs. One day, I decided to take up my original challenge and create my own style with some clay pots my mother had given me. This has led me to where I am today. I'm grateful to my mother because, as an artisan, she gave me the art that flows through my veins.<br \/><br \/>I'd like to thank my dear friends around the world who support me through this microcredit.

Ahmad lives there with his wife and his son.\r\n\r\nAhmad owns a stall that sells daily consumer products and mobile airtime credits to his community. He joined Ruma almost a year ago. He knew about Ruma from a Ruma sales executive that came to his stall. He decided to join Ruma because he wants to expand his business through technology.\r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Ahmad is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to process more mobile airtime credits for his community, so his community can easily connect with their loved ones no matter how far they are apart. Knowing about the importance of this, your loan will be very useful to help Ahmad improve his business and, accordingly, his community who needs access to such services. \r\n\r\nAhmad\u2019s goal with Ruma in the near future is to service an e-commerce business for his customers. As seen in the photo, Ahmad is the one who is sitting and smiling in his own stall. He will be very thankful for your kind support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1833105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase more prepaid airtime credits to sell to community members who want to use mobile phones to connect with their loved ones","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Sukabumi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-03-15T23:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-14T23:00:08Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ahmad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":7000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":7000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-14T18:22:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":853228,"name":"Darwing","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Darwing is an artisan from Nicaragua who specializes in ceramic vases.

You might say I have ceramics in my blood, and I love this art. Sometimes our work fetches a good price and others, not so good. I'm proud I've been able to get ahead in life and change my family's living conditions. We've exchanged poverty for a more dignified way of life. Now I'm also contributing to preserving the precious arts of San Juan de Oriente by teaching future ceramists. I've always considered myself to be a traditional artisan. My designs actually come from the generations before me. I do feel as though I create pre-Hispanic and geometric art while preserving its roots. My wife helps me in my workshop, as do some other artisans. The sale of our ceramics benefits the entire community, because we're able to hire people in our workshop and to purchase our basic necessities in the local markets, which are run by people from the town.\" <br \/><br \/>\"My friends, this microcredit serves as a great example of how there are so many wonderful people in this work who still support one another.

His business is making handcrafted furniture out of large reeds.  He is independent, enterprising, responsible, persevering, patient and hard-working.  He carries out his business in the \u201cChililaya Grande\u201d community, an area near the sacred Lake Titicaca, where the inhabitants largely make a living in fishing, agriculture and handicrafts.  It is a cold and dry climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 0 and 12 degrees Celsius (approximately 32 and 54 degrees Fahrenheit). \r\n\r\nOmar is tan-complected with short black hair, dark eyes, short stature and a thin physique.  His native tongue is Aymara which is spoken here and he speaks Spanish for the general culture and for business that he does.  He lives with his wife who makes a living weaving and with his son who is starting school.  They live in their own house made of adobe that has well water and electricity.  \r\n\r\nHis business is making furniture from \u201ctotora\u201d (large reeds), a natural material from the lake that has been used since the time of the Incas.  With this material they made boats with which they sliced through the waters of Lake Titicaca.  The most common types of furniture are: large chairs, beds, hammocks and more.  This knowledge is the legacy of his father who is a craftsman, \u201cI have done this activity since I was very young.  At first it was a game, then we made furniture to order until I got married and had to become independent,\u201d he says.  \r\n\r\nHis dreams are to build a brick house and give drinking water to his family.  He wants to carry out a wholesale purchase of reeds to make furniture and give a better future to his children.  This is the second sequence of loans with the institution in the 4 years that he has been making a living in this activity independently. \r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Omar is requesting a loan: for the purchase of reeds to make handcrafted furniture and give a better life to his children. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":365.15,"image":{"id":1833693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase large reeds to make handcrafted furniture and to give his children a better life.
