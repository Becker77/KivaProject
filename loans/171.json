She has many years of experience in this business.    Lelei needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to financially support extended members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lelei joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Lelei's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.  \r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from secondary\/high-school.

She has two daughters, 6 and 4 years old. Okasana and her husband are farmers, but her husband works as a builder when there is an opportunity. Right after their marriage, her husband suggested breeding cattle. They started breeding cattle together 2 years ago with an initial investment of 10,000 soms. With the help of profits from cattle breeding they improved their living conditions significantly. Now, they receive 1500 soms a month as a profit from cattle breeding and in order to increase their profits they want to buy farm animals. With money received from the loan Okasana wants to purchase two farm animals and hay to feed them during the winter season. This loan would help them increase their profits and provide better living conditions for their two little daughters. \r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\n\r\nShaiyr O. is treasurer of the group. She is 60 and married. She has a daughter who is 20. Her daughter works as a seamstress. Her husband is farmer and Shaiyr has been  breeding cattle for almost 2 years. She started breeding cattle with an initial investment of 2500 soms. Now, she makes 1500 soms monthly from cattle breeding. In order to increase her profits, she's planning to buy 4 more ewes, then fatten and sell them at a higher price. She already has educated her daughter about the profits from cattle breeding. Now, she wants to prepare a dowry for her daughter, also from the profits from cattle breeding. \r\n\r\nUlan O. is 35 and married. He has two sons, 9 and 8 years old.   Both of his sons go to school. His wife is a seamstress. Ulan in his turn combines cattle breeding with a job as a taxi driver in order to provide for members of his family. He has been in the cattle breeding business for two years; he started with initial investments of 20,000 soms. Now, it brings him 2000 soms monthly. Like other group members, in order to increase his profits from cattle breeding, he needs more head of cattle. So, this is the first reason for his application for a loan. The second reason is that he needs to make car repairs so as to continue his job as a taxi driver. With the profit from a loan, he is planning to increase significantly the number of head of livestock he has and buy a flat in the capital of Kyrgyzstan (Bishkek) where his children can enjoy better educational opportunities. \r\n\r\nAlmazbek O. is 40 and married. He has two daughters, 6 and 4 years old. His wife is a teacher of the Kyrgyz language at a local school. Almazbek as well as Ulan has to combine his job as an engineer with agriculture in order to provide for members of his family. 7 years ago, he received as a present from his parents an area under cultivation, which pushed him to start sowing potatoes and wheat. He started sowing potatoes and wheat with initial investments of 3000 soms. Profit from agriculture provided for his family and improved the living conditions of his family. Besides this, he bought furniture for his house. His profit from agriculture is 1500 soms per month. Now, he wants to start cattle breeding. In order to start cattle breeding, he needs to buy at least one head of cattle. Thus, he is applying for a loan. This loan will help him to buy one head of cattle and forage for cattle. He believes that he will increase significantly his herd. On the received profits, he wants to make capital repairs on his house and provide better living conditions for his family. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

D. is from the village of Arpeni in the Shirak region of Armenia.  He is married with three children; a 28 year old daughter and two sons (24 and 27 years old).  Garnik has a high school education from his home town of Arpeni.  His daughter is married and lives in the city of Gyumri.  Garnik assists his daughter\u2019s family with home grown vegetables and financial support.  Garnik supports his family with cattle and sheep breeding.  He has been in this work for over 30 years.  He considers himself a hard working yet modest person.  \r\n\r\nGarnik is looking for a loan to purchase additional sheep and feed.

She tells us that it has been very difficult to get her children ahead in life because the wage that her husband earns as a construction worker doesn't cover all their household expenses.  Sometimes he has no work which has made it difficult to achieve financial stability since sources of work are very scarce in their town.

Asmahan wants to replace her old home furniture and purchase new necessary ones such as: bedroom furniture, living room furniture, etc., but she hasn't enough money to pay, so she needs to take a loan from Kiva partner FATEN. When Asmahan gets the loan, she will purchase new home furniture and provide for her family better and comfortable home living conditions. Asmahan is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead in the picture.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

It is thanks to agriculture that he is able to provide for the education and needs of his children. The years have granted him the experience that he needs to be a good farmer. He uses this knowledge everyday to work toward the healthy growth of each one of his plants. Sixto hopes to increase his crops in rented plots, from which, with the help of his bicycle, he easily transports all of his crops. \r\n\r\nSixto is a very responsible client and the first to make his monthly payments. He also helps out by informing the other members if there is an unscheduled meeting of their communal bank. This is his 9th loan with MFP and he is very respected by the other members because of the responsibility he has demonstrated. With the requested 1500 PEN, he will buy chemical fertilizers for his vegetable plots.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":323149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-25T03:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sixto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733856}],"funded_date":"2009-05-25T05:06:28Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":114231,"name":"Nuevo Atardecer Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cNuevo Atardecer\u201d esta representado por la se\u00f1ora Miguelina, Jenny y Dalia que son su presidenta, tesorera y secretaria.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 50 years old, is married and has 5 children.  Takhir has 3 dairy cows.  Because he is the only provider in the family, he together with his son (see photo) milk the cows and sell milk at the local market.  It is very difficult to provide for a family of 5 children and Takhir plans to increase the number of cows in order to increase his milk supply.  \r\n\r\nTakhir is asking for a loan of $500 to purchase dairy calves.  At the local market one calf costs $100, by purchasing 5 calves, Takhir will be able to triple his milk production, which will provide him with an extra $500 in profits every month.\r\n\r\n Translated

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":304233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

She has been engaged in this business for more than four years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP from her work.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Erlinda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and expand her small business.

She plans to use the additional income made possible by this loan to support the education of children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Mahmud is 48 years old and lives with his wife and four children. His plans for his family are to improve their quality of life and give a better education to all his children. \r\n\r\nMahmud began working in the fields two years ago. It was his father who taught him how to work with the earth. Mahmud works in farming and also raises cattle, which he sells to bring in extra income. With this loan he will buy farming supplies so his harvest will be good and he can sell it for a good price in the market. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing transportation services to community members. He also keeps busy buying and selling scrap and waste materials in their community. Jay has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jay joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jay has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase used bottles and newspapers to sell. Jay is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to repair the motorcycle used in the business. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Jay from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of his children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

When his crops are harvested, they are sold as an additional source of household income.\r\n<p>\r\nIsaul is requesting a loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1000 PEN so that he can buy balanced feed for his animals and fertilizers to improve his farmland.

Isaul is a hardworking and responsible person whose only wish is for his family to move forward, especially seeing his children achieve their goals.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":907400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy balanced feed for his animals and fertilizers for his farmland.

In 1985, after finishing school, she was accepted to the Medical college in the city of Kyzyl-Kiya.  In 1986, when Risbu completed her first year of college, she was stolen to marry (an old tradition of \"stealing brides\" that has existed for a long time and is currently persecuted by law up to a criminal responsibility).  Because of the marriage, Risbu had to stop her education and become a housewife.  Her oldest son, Toktaaly, was born in 1990, and her youngest son, Begaly, was born in 1993.  In 2000, Risbu and her family moved to the Chuysk region (northern part of the country) to the Rovnoye village, where they rented a shepherd's house.  This is when a difficult period for Risbu's family began - her husband did not work, and Risbu became disabled after an operation.  In 2009, Risbu started her own animal husbandry business to provide a source of income for her family after purchasing one dairy cow.  Today, the monthly profit from sales of milk products amounts to about 4,500 som (KGS).  Thanks to hard work and persistence, Risbu and her husband were able to purchase a used car, and Risbu's husband began providing a taxi service.  In order to further develop her business, Risbu requested a loan in the sum of 40,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase a dairy cow.  This will allow her to increase milk sales and her profits.  Risbu plans to invest the profits into building a house for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":983790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

This is thirty-one-year-old Domina A. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with two children under the age of five. Domina runs a stationery store in the Tabata district of Dar, which she established in 2006. The foresight and insight of people who have never received any training in business management, never ceases to amaze me. Stationary sales is a business where such wisdom is demonstrated, with most sellers placing their shops, stalls, tables or bodies strategically near to post offices, banks, schools and universities. <P>Domina is no exception! Her well-situated store earns her US$ 200 in monthly profits. Domina further demonstrates her business acumen through the intended use of her loan. She is requesting $875 to buy a photocopier which she will then allow her customers to use for a fee. I\u2019m confident that Domina will be able to obtain a good return on her investment before the end of her loan term.<P>\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client.<P> The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":191766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy a photocopier for her stationery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-29T18:50:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-12T21:21:13Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-20T07:18:43Z","rounded_local_amount":203525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356185},{"amount":175,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":203525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347927},{"amount":175,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":203525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970501},{"amount":175,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":203525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886718},{"amount":175,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:19Z","rounded_local_amount":203525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435978}],"funded_date":"2008-08-29T21:21:13Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65098,"name":"Maria Isabel","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Isabel Z.

To be able to make ends meet, she has been making a living by baking and selling bread for the past two years. Being that she is so young, she has always wanted to work toward a better future, which is why she decided to start the bakery. She works from approximately 5-7 a.m. baking the bread, which she then distributes to various stores. The most difficult part about her job is making the bread, since she bakes with her home oven and the temperature can get quite excessive. However, Yesenia knows that the only way to make progress is to keep working very hard, and that's why she looks to improve from day to day. This is her first loan with Kiva partner Microfinanzas Prisma. With the money she is requesting she will purchase a larger quantity of ingredients to make her breads, as well as buy some accessories so her small bakery can be much more productive and she can earn a better income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":233117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase larger quantities of ingredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-06T08:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yesenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":141.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957757},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":141.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228007},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":141.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423239},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":141.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116492},{"amount":45.71,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":141.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011438},{"amount":46.41,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":143.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595056}],"funded_date":"2008-12-06T13:52:59Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":81495,"name":"Ziad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ziad is a 22-year-old man who lives in Tyre, in southern Lebanon.

She will also buy more fruit to sell.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":343238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase her merchandise and to tune up her car\/Incremento de mercader\u00eda y refacci\u00f3n de su carro","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-26T12:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":336}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":111,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":338,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211925},{"amount":111,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":337.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641453},{"amount":111,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":337.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080892},{"amount":111,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":337.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997033},{"amount":111,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":337.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842372},{"amount":445,"local_amount":1335,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1355.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733942}],"funded_date":"2009-06-27T17:14:44Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Liz Harvey","image":null}},{"id":122455,"name":"Jeanette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeanette L. is from the town of Cabuan, Guinsiliban, Camiguin.

Heredia, in the central valley of Costa Rica. Miriam has opened a bazaar inside her house, where her clients can come by to peruse the various products she has for sale. Through her sales, Miriam hopes to complement the pension she receives from the government to offset the impact of diabetes. To date, Miriam has lost two toes from her left foot and a benign tumor has formed in her stomach (it is currently being determined whether an operation is necessary) due to her illness.\r\n\r\nMiriam opened her bazaar three months ago with the financial support of her eldest son. As you can see in the picture, Miriam sells all types of items, such as candles, ceramics (hand painted by Miriam) and lights. She plans to use this loan to purchase inventory items to sell at her bazaar such as cleaning products, as well as painting supplies for her ceramics. Miriam enjoys painting ceramics and hopes to invest in this activity in order to offer her clients inspiring decorations for their homes. The main use of this loan will be to fill her bazaar with items for sale.\r\n\r\nMiriam wakes up at 5 am every day, prepares breakfast for her children, carries out domestic jobs, and sends her children to school. Her daughter assists with these tasks and goes to night classes. One of her sons works all day and returns at night.\r\n\r\nMiriam's goal is to increase sales revenues in an effort to improve the family's standard of living. Since opening her business, she has been able to earn $200 per month in profit, to complement the $200 she receives from the government. The cost of rent and public services eats up $200 per month, so Miriam is hoping to increase her revenues from the bazaar. Miriam has received training from the National Institute of Apprenticeship in accounting and administration, with the goal of supporting the success of her business.\r\n\r\nThe main obstacle in her life and her business is her diabetic condition. Her physical mobility has been compromised, making it difficult to travel even short distances, and the presence of a tumour has created both physical and psychological stress.

Her previous loan of PHP 19500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19500, which she intends to use to buy stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for future improvements of the business. \r\n\r\nGleceria D. P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She supports her family by operating a livestock business. She lives in Purok 3, Brgy. Datag, Siaton, Negors Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her livestock business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000. Cynthia is now borrowing PHP 13,000. This will be her ninth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000, which she paid off well within its term, was another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Cynthia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Two of their children study in high school, while another one is in elementary.\r\n\r\nImelda runs her own sari-sari (variety) store at home. Being twenty years in business, she knows what her community needs and wants to see in her store. With the training she receives from CCT*, she adeptly uses the money on hand to buy the essential merchandise and meet the needs of her customers. Each month she earns an average income of $277. \r\n\r\nTo further help her with her business, Imelda decided to borrow 26,000 PHP. With this money she plans to buy food items that she knows her neighbors need daily, such as instant food sold in pouches, soap bars, and powdered milk. She also intends to buy Johnson&Johnson products like talc powder. \r\n\r\nBeing tough in meeting life's challenges head on calls for an attitude that focuses on the solution rather than on the problem. Imelda practices this, and admits that no challenge can pull her spirit down. She desires to see her business boom and to maintain the good health of her family. More than anything else, she prays to see her children demonstrating the same kind of toughness she has when it comes to their studies, and finish schooling with flying colors.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

In order to do this, he needs a larger quantity of fertilizers so that his crops can develop adequately. He hopes to grow high quality crops so that he can sell them for a better price in the markets. For this reason, Ochilboy is asking for a loan to increase his production and improve his products, the sales from which will fund the planting of a new cycle of crops.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Estebana has two sons: the elder is 18 and in his fifth year of high school and the younger is 15 and in his fourth year of high school.  Her husband works as a farmer.  She wants to keep her business going as she needs to continue sending her sons to school so that they can have careers.  She dreams of investing in her inventory so that she can become a major distributor as she would like to have a wide variety of products.  She hopes that God will keep her alive long enough for her to know her grandchildren because now her sons are studying.  She hopes her children will have careers and only after that start their own families, and in this way make decisions about their future.\r\n\r\nShe owns a grocery store, which she runs from her home.  She has had this business for eight years.  Estebana started the business to help pay the household expenses.  She began as a street vendor, offering her products in the streets and sometimes near schools as most of her customers were children.  She had the idea to stabilize her business and that she could locate it in her home.  In the beginning is was not easy and she needed her family's help as she started with a limited variety of goods such as lollipops, chocolates, sweets, soft drinks and fresh fruit shakes.  Her clients were always looking for more products and so she decided to borrow in order to expand her grocery store and this helped her.  In this manner she has been improving her business and she is now asking for this loan to stock her store with school supplies as her customers are now asking for products for school.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":266459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" capital de trabajo","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-26T00:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estebana De La Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":785.71},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":785.71},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":785.71},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":785.71},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":785.71},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":785.71},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":785.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":785.71,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:50Z","rounded_local_amount":791.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400010},{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":785.71,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":791.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092008},{"amount":39.28,"local_amount":785.71,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":791.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985391},{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":785.71,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:54Z","rounded_local_amount":791.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446006},{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":785.71,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":791.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956647},{"amount":39.3,"local_amount":785.71,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:15Z","rounded_local_amount":791.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174072},{"amount":39.26,"local_amount":785.74,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:30:01Z","rounded_local_amount":791.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599696}],"funded_date":"2009-02-26T03:12:13Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T15:30:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":89703,"name":"Ng\u00f4 Th\u1ecb H\u1eb1ng Group","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"       Ch\u1ecb H., 27 tu\u1ed5i l\u00e0 m\u1ed9t ph\u1ee5 n\u1eef tr\u1ebb kh\u00e9o l\u00e9o, \u0111\u1ea3m \u0111ang, th\u00e1o v\u00e1t.

With this loan he can allow his animals to grow more and thus achieve the results that will help take care of the economic necessities of the nuclear family.

They live in Palca Grande, 90 kilometers from the city of Sacaba.  They are humble, low-income people that lack funds to enlarge their grocery store.

The community is quite removed from the city; public transportation in the area is sporadic, buses are available once a week only.\r\n\r\nEdwin lacks funds to increase his grocery inventory so he needs funding to do so.  His store is the only one in the area that provides these basic need items.  It is very difficult for them to go to traditional banks in the city to solicit loans.  CIDRE is closer and works with rural communities so they are able to call upon it to request loans to improve their business.\r\n\r\nEdwin\u2019s wife, Miguelina, tells us that her greatest dream is that her daughter become a nurse.  In order for this to happen, she must have funds enough and savings to pay for her studies.

Reneline's regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 5,800 PHP in sales every month.\r\n<br>To help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy orders for her customers.

They have 3 children who are between 6 to 10 years old years old and are all currently going to school. \r\n\r\nBienvinida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family.

Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 25,000, increasing the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to pay for more stock to sell so that she can continue to save for future purposes.

The daily income he earns selling food covers household expenses and his monthly salary as a professor pays for education for his children.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP and what Roger likes about his community bank is that between all the members they work well together and give each other the confidence to keep advancing. With the money he is requesting, he will buy tables and chairs for his business. He currently doesn't have anywhere to seat the customers that come to his small food stand every day.

B. is a young man 21 years old who lives in a community called El Sa\u00edno de Pital located in the province of Alajuela. The community's primary productive activity is cattle farming and agriculture with an emphasis on the cultivation of pineapple, which is sold mostly in international markets. For this reason, the development of the community has been growing the last few years generating a large demand for the products and services which is helping mitigate the effect of immigration.\r\n\r\nCesar works in a pineapple exportation plant, but on his weekends and free days he works on his plantation which is on rented land. His wish is to overcome the need to work extra hours to have a better quality of life both for him and for his young daughter.\r\n\r\nThe micro credit loan he is asking for right now is for \u00a2530,000 (five hundred thirty thousand colones), to buy baby pineapple plants, fertilizers and different consumables to give the best maintenance and assistance possible to his crops. In the end he will be able to be rewarded and will have a much better production. \r\n\r\nC\u00e9sar is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Luz del Futuro Saino, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. It will be his first loan and he requests it with the hope of continuing to grow both on a personal and economic level. Also, he emphasizes his thanks for this type of organization and all the credit facilitators that allow him to dedicate more time to productive activities. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

He is 46 years old. Cornelio is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Cornelio owns and operates a furniture-making business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from making and selling cabinets and bedroom and dining room furniture to local businesses and community members. Cornelio has been engaged in his business for over 8 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Cornelio joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cornelio is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand his product offerings. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Cornelio from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
