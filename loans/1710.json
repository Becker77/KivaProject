Now it\u2019s time for you to meet one of the Ruma agents, Deni. Deni lives in East Bandung, a semi-urban area located about three hours' drive from Jakarta. Deni is happily married. Together with his wife, they have a very cute six-year-old daughter. \r\n\r\nDeni owns a stall that sells mobile airtime credits and provides bill payment services for his community. It has been almost a year since he joined Ruma. He learned about Ruma from Ruma\u2019s sales executive who came to his stall. He decided to join Ruma because he was interested in Ruma\u2019s system; the sales executive will be coming to his stall to collect the money. Moreover, his community sees him as a friendly and informative mobile airtime credit provider.\r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Deni is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the loan to process more mobile airtime credits and bill payment services to his community. Having known about the importance, your loan will be very useful to help Deni improve his business and accordingly, his community, which needs access to such services.  \r\n\r\nDeni\u2019s goal in the near future is to serve as an e-commerce business for his customers. As seen in the photo, Deni is the one who is standing and smiling in his own stall. He will be very thankful for your kind support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1832796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase more prepaid airtime credits to sell to community members who want to use mobile phones to connect with their loved ones.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bandung Timur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-03-16T00:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-15T00:00:11Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":17500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":17500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-14T22:34:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":853833,"name":"Juan De Dios","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan, de 33 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ado, estudio hasta s\u00e9ptimo grado y tiene 2 hijos.\n\nJuan, se levantaba a las 4:00 de la ma\u00f1ana para irse al trabajo, sal\u00eda a las 11 de la ma\u00f1ana y solo llegaba a la casa a cambiarse de ropa para ir a la escuela.- El trabajo para \u00e9l no ha cambiado, siempre se dedica a cultivar ma\u00edz y frijol; tambi\u00e9n ayuda en la finca a sus vecinos.\n\nEl dinero del cr\u00e9dito lo necesita para comprar harinilla para darle de comer a los cerdos que tiene, de esa manera los engordar\u00e1 m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido y los vender\u00e1; siempre ha criado cerdos, para tener ingresos y as\u00ed cubrir sus necesidades.\n\nSu mayor sue\u00f1o es, que sus hijos sean profesionales y que no hagan el mismo trabajo que \u00e9l hace, pues es muy pesado.- Tambi\u00e9n sue\u00f1a con hacer m\u00e1s grande su casa de habitaci\u00f3n, y darle una mejor comodidad a su familia.\n\n","en":"Juan is 33 years old, he has a partner, he studied until the seventh grade and has two children.\r\n\r\nHe gets up at 4 in the morning to go to work, leaving at 11 in the morning, and only going home to change clothes to go to school.

Now it\u2019s time for you to meet one of the Ruma's agents, Szikron. Szikron lives in Pekalongan, a city located in Central Java, around two hours from Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, by plane. Szikron lives there with his wife and his three daughters. He owns a stall that sells mobile phone accessories and mobile airtime credits for his community. He has already been part of Ruma for almost a year, and he knew Ruma from Ruma\u2019s sales executive, who came to his stall. He decided to join Ruma because he already heard before that Ruma has the best service and system.\r\n\r\nHis community sees Szikron as a trusted mobile provider. As the business grows, Szikron is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the loan to process more mobile airtime credits to his community, so that people in his community can easily connect with their loved ones, no matter how far they are apart. Besides, from their personal perspective, Szikron and his wife realized that they have to save some money for their daughters\u2019 education. \r\n\r\nHaving known about the importance, your loan will be very useful to help Szikron improve his business (and if the business has been improved, it will be easier for Szikron and his wife to save more money for their daughters\u2019 education), and accordingly, his community, which needs access to such services.  \r\n\r\nSzikron\u2019s goal with Ruma in the near future is to serve as an e-commerce business for his customers. As seen in the photo, Szikron is the one who is sitting in his own stall. He will be very thankful for your kind support.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1832807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase more prepaid airtime credits to sell to community members who want to use mobile phones to connect with their loved ones.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Pekalongan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-03-16T00:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-15T00:00:11Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Szikron","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":12000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":12000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":853859,"name":"Jose Luis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jose es un hombre de 40 a\u00f1os de edad, casado, tiene 3 hijos de 16, 13 y 11 a\u00f1os,  y su negocio es la carpinter\u00eda. \n\u00c9l es emprendedor, independiente, constante, paciente, generoso, responsable y trabajador.

Her business is to make and sell alpaca and vicuna shawls. She is entrepreneurial, optimistic, with a good attitude, patient, responsible and hard working. She works in the \"Villa Dolores\" zone, the oldest and most populated area in the city. In the area where the people live there is not much commerce, but mainly manufacturing to be sold in other cities, with a cold and dry climate and an average temperature which fluctuates between 0-12 degrees Celsius. Claudina has a dark complexion, long, gray, braided hair, brown eyes, short stature, thin built. Her dress attire is traditional (hat, shawl, and big skirt,) her native language is Aymara which is spoken in the area. She speaks Spanish as general knowledge and to do business. She shares her life with her son who works and studies. They live in their own home built of brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof, running water, electricity, a sewage system and home delivered gas. Her business is to manufacture vicuna and alpaca shawls. These shawls are a clothing accesory used by traditional indigenous women (las cholitas) to warm their shoulders. They are well liked, and they vary based on designs and fashion. \"I started my business weaving alpaca wool and I used to sell it to the weavers. Little by little, I started getting involved in manufacturing these knits which is my new enterprise..,\" she stated. Her advantage is that she has extensive experience in the market and she has consistent clients. Her disadvantage is that she doesn't have a steady point of sale and she sells on the street. Her dream is to have a store of alpaca knits. She wants to purchase the alpaca and vicuna wool to weave it and to make cholita shawls.

She is a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Glen, a tricycle driver, and has four children who are elementary students. She and her husband work hard to meet their everyday needs and to support their children's schooling. \r\n\r\nMelanie operates a tricycle unit. Her  husband drives the tricycle that carries up to four passengers. In the Philippines, especially in the provinces like Cavite, the tricycle is a common means of transportation. Jeepneys and buses are limited. Very few people own a vehicle. The town people usually ride a tricycle from their homes to market, church, to their friend\u2019s homes and to other destinations within their community. They even transport people from one town to the other. Aside from operating a tricycle, she also sells charcoal burners. She earns a minimum of 800 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy gas and pay for maintenance of her tricycle. She is positive that this will boost her income as the tricycle is really a necessity in their community. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help and a good return, for it will surely help cover their daily needs and fund her children's education.\r\n\r\nMelanie dreams to be successful in her business so she can give her children the best education. She prays for the safety of her husband and their passengers. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is were she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1833175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay for the gas and maintenance of her tricycle unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-03-16T05:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-15T05:20:05Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melanie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3689.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187211},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3689.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536238},{"amount":66.64,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2951.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017453},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":737.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313870}],"funded_date":"2015-03-16T09:36:52Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":853397,"name":"Rosela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosela is 59 years old and married.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

She is a caring wife and the mother of four children.  She is also a very conscientious and hardworking woman.  Her entire family works on a collective farm.  On their allotted plot of land, they grow various vegetables and grains.  After the harvest, they send their crops for resale at the market. This is how Bahriniso and her family make a living.  Over the last season, they made a good income from the harvest and they were able to renovate their house.  This year, Bahriniso's husband wants to go abroad and work as a migrant worker.  The family has a big celebration coming up at the end of the year, but so far they don't have enough money to pay for it.  For this reason, Bahriniso has turned to Arvand and requested a loan to buy a plane ticket for her husband.

She was born in 1990 and is from the northern part of the country, and she lives in a remote district. She is a powerful, honest, brave and hospitable person. She has now remarried and has three children. Her husband helps to do business with her. He supports Anora with finance and with his own labor. \r\n\r\nFor about ten years, Anora has been doing business through agriculture. She keeps livestock and works on the land with plantings.

Meet Koech, a 37-year-old entrepreneur from Kamaget village, South Rift Kenya. Koech practices mixed farming for a living. He also engages in side businesses that fill gaps in the market, solve societal problems, and offer decent returns. The latest venture on his list is a grain mill. \r\n\r\nOccupants of Kamaget village travel long distances to have their grains processed into flour. Most resort to assigning this duty to children who would otherwise be spending this precious time and energy at school. Koech is planning to start a grain mill located within the village, where it is more convenient for potential customers, thus saving time and travel expenses. \r\n\r\nAcquiring machinery and equipment necessary to have a grain mill running is very costly, especially for a small-scale farmer like Koech. He is appealing to Kiva lenders for external financing that will make his latest venture come to life. Your investment will not only have a strong impact on his family, but also his community.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":248.46,"image":{"id":1833366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to set up a grain mill.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-16T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-15T16:20:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.72,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Koech","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3870.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3983.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4100.28},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4220.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4343.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4470.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4601.03},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4735.49},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.89},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5016.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.93},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5313.82},{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5469.11},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5628.95},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5793.45},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5962.77},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6137.06},{"due_date":"2016-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6316.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.89},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.12},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.62},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.74},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.37},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.04},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.54},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.25},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.19},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":122.65,"local_amount":11136.05,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:52:02Z","rounded_local_amount":11329.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.08,"payment_id":681378340},{"amount":40.96,"local_amount":3857.42,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3924.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.9,"payment_id":711506318},{"amount":42.53,"local_amount":3923.38,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3991.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.06,"payment_id":731023162},{"amount":37.6,"local_amount":3445.4,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3505.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.68,"payment_id":752111308}],"funded_date":"2015-04-15T02:05:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":853510,"name":"Kingote","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kingote is a 30-year-old, married man.

Kenya. Litein's high altitude and its cool and wet climate make it ideal for two kinds of farming: tea and dairy. Cherotich is a dairy farmer whose main income comes from the milk that she sells in the nearby market called Kapkoros.\r\n\r\nCherotich is planning to venture into cash crop farming, as her land is big enough to support the new venture. The only impediment seems to be lack of adequate capital. She has saved enough over time to cover most of the expenses, but she still needs help to acquire the tools necessary for crop cultivation. \r\n\r\nCherotich is therefore seeking a loan of KES 80,000 to pay for farm implements. It will be a hard and labour intensive task to break the ground and to do proper seedbed preparation, so she needs farm tools that are cheap, modern and in good condition. Your loan will enable her to afford suitable tools for the job. \r\n\r\nIncreased income from the new venture will broaden the family's opportunites to enjoy adequate food.

With the profits that she gains from this year\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nPamela and her group will receive a total of eight solar lights as well as input loans of maize and fertilizer to plant a total of five acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1789131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-03-16T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-15T22:20:03Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacob W.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wycliffe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":83850,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-15T21:53:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":853585,"name":"Jean Damascene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jean Damascene is a 35-year-old married father of three children ranging in age from eight to 12 years, all attending school.

The profits from the business will be used to buy a piece of land and to improve his welfare.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She lives in the Vakhsh district with her husband, her son and her daughter-in-law.  Zhamoloy and her husband work as farmers.  Every year, they plant crops and live on the earnings they get from their harvest.  This year, they don't have enough money to plant crops and Zhamoloy sees no other solution than to take a loan.  She will be using her money to buy mineral fertilizers in order to prepare her land for the next harvest.  Without mineral fertilizers, Zhamoloy and her husband will not be able to get a good harvest during the next season.  Zhamoloy has decided to apply for this loan herself because MLO Humo particularly supports female clients, simplifying their lending conditions and developing new products to support women entrepreneurs.  Zhamoloy hopes that Kiva lenders will help her.  She is expecting a rich harvest next season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1834939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy mineral fertilizers for the planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Vakhsh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"37.710833 68.831111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-03-16T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-15T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.66,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zhamoloy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":184}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.47},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.47},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.47},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.46},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.46},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":259.34,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:30:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1501.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.66,"payment_id":711525808}],"funded_date":"2015-03-17T23:00:31Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T16:30:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":853684,"name":"Tosigwegwe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tosigwegwe, who is in her mid-40's, is divorced with four children.

For him, this work is very important because it is what he does and lives for.\r\n\r\nManuel\u2019s big dream is to see his children become big professionals, but one of his challenges is that he doesn\u2019t have enough money to be able to cover his children\u2019s expenses for school. Nonetheless, he wants his children to have everything they need to be able to become good professionals. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, he requests a loan that he will use to pay school fees and to buy book and notebooks. Manuel has hopes pinned on this loan, since it will allow him to offer his children a better education. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450.14,"image":{"id":1834667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to buy book and notebooks and to pay for school fees.

22, is a smallholder dairy farmer from Cheplanget village based in the Litein region of Kenya. Emmanuel is hardworking and determined to make it in the world of farming. The land he owns is big enough to support more than just dairy animals. He is planning to make use of the available space to start growing food crops. \r\n\r\nStarting a horticultural farm is very costly, especially for smallholder rural farmers. Besides securing land space, a farmer needs to invest in intensive labour, farm tools, and farm inputs. The farmer will also have to construct a store\/granary for his\/her produce. \r\n\r\nEmmanuel is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to venture into horticulture.
