He is married and has two children, aged 42 and 39. In 2010, Mohamed established his rice, sugar and Maggi (a seasoning product) business. He began his business because he is now a retired tanker driver.  His son opened the business for him.  His business is located in the outskirts of the city and his main customers are men and women.

She raises goats and sheep, and cultivates corn to produce their forage. She decided to acquire a biodigester in order to become more self-sufficient, by taking advantage of her animals' manure. \r\n\r\nIt used to be difficult for Maria Guadalupe to make ends meet between the purchase of expensive LP gas and chemical fertilizers, and the time she spent looking for wood in the surrounding areas. With her biodigester, this will all change, and she will displace these costly and unsustainable external inputs. \r\n\r\nMaria Guadalupe will become her own energy and organic fertilizer provider, as she will transform manure into biogas and nutrient-rich fertilizer for her field. She will save money and improve the air quality in her house, as she eliminates the toxic smoke created by burning wood, while also increasing the yield of her corn field in a natural way. \r\n\r\nAs the whole family gets used to the biodigester, she plans to expand her little garden to grow more vegetables and diversify her family's diet. Maria Guadalupe wants to use her savings to send her grandchildren to school and university.\r\n\r\nThis loan represents 16% of the total cost of the biodigester, the remaining part will be covered by a government subsidy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1833857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"to invest in a 6 m3 Sistema Biobolsa biodigester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huimilpan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":226,"posted_date":"2015-03-17T03:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-16T03:20:06Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":3009,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3009}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100.1,"local_amount":1506,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T12:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1565.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636742172},{"amount":46.53,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":727.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665216457},{"amount":53.37,"local_amount":803,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-31T12:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":834.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681523119}],"funded_date":"2015-03-17T05:55:16Z","paid_date":"2015-07-31T12:13:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sue Tritt","image":null}},{"id":853928,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"He is 47 years old, married and works as a market trader.

This new loan will go to additional supplies she needs to improve her business. She will also buy raw materials and supplies she needs to increase her production of doormats that she also sells. Her customers will likely buy more items if she has more of her products displayed in her store. An increase in sales will also result in a significant increase in profit, which will also result in her business becoming viable and sustainable. Simultaneously, she could sustain the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nBebelyn wants her business to continue to flourish. She meets every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1833942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

She has been selling milk practically since the time she met her husband because he owns dairy cows.  Ana also grows corn on a parcel of land that is located three kilometers from her house.  Her children also look after the cows and the crops.  Ana wakes up at 4:00 A.M. so that she can help her husband with milking the cows.  Later in the day, she prepares the milk by putting it in containers so that it can be sold.  <br \/><br \/>Ana plans to set up a small fruit business at her house.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan in order to buy fruits such as papayas, watermelons, melons, oranges, apples, and other produce.  Her dream is to give her children the opportunity to study so that they can have a better quality of

In addition this will provide convenience, cleanliness and privacy for all family members, while contributing to the environmental protection of the community. \r\n\r\nIn the picture, Chuyen is pictured first from the left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1833866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to pay for the construction of a hygienic toilet and a hand-washing device with soap.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Vietnam","town":"Hai Duong","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":331,"posted_date":"2015-03-17T08:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-16T08:00:02Z","loan_amount":5175,"lender_count":111,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chuy\u1ec3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"H\u01b0\u01a1ng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"T\u00e8o","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"M\u00ed","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"V\u00f9ng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"D\u1ee3i","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thu\u00fd","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nhi\u1ec5n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dung","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tranh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":110000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":5175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":55000000},{"due_date":"2017-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":55000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2587.5},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2587.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lavender","image":1304534}},{"id":852339,"name":"J\u00e8kafo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Lassana est l'homme qui tient le mouton en main sur la photo.\nLassina est un jeune maliens de 38 ans, mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de 4 enfants \u00e2g\u00e9e de 13 \u00e0 2 ans, trois de ses enfants fr\u00e9quentent l\u2019\u00e9cole, sa conjointe est m\u00e9nag\u00e8re, il vit dans un petit village de cultivateur au Mali.\nLassina est analphab\u00e8te, mais connait l\u2019utilit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9cole,  inscrit tous ses enfant ayant l\u2019\u00e2g\u00e9 d\u2019aller \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole.

He is married to Irene, a homemaker, and they have one child who is an elementary student. Joey works hard to provide for his family.\r\n\r\nJoey owns and operates his own jeepney transport service. He has a one-unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney. \r\n\r\nJeepneys are the most common form of public transport throughout the many islands of the Philippines. Most of the time, the jeepneys are packed with passengers. Jeepneys offer one of the cheapest ways of getting somewhere. They are one of the remnants of the American military presence in the Philippines during the Second World War and are still to be seen throughout the Philippines in many colors and all over the place. \r\n\r\nThe Filipinos saw possibilities in these Jeeps. They saw a real transportation means by making these Jeeps about two meters longer and by putting two long seats in them, one on each side from the front to the back. Since then, jeepneys have been used as small buses for cheap transport of people, goods, and even sometimes little animals. Jeepney transport service is one of the stable businesses in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, Joey is requesting a PHP 9,000 loan that he will use for the maintenance of his jeepney. It is very important that his unit is always in good running condition to ensure efficient service. He is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given him.\r\n\r\nJoey hopes to buy another jeepney unit. He dreams of giving his child the best education. He prays for his and his passengers' safety on every trip. Every week, he faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members* to share stories of his work and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her earnings are the source from which they meet their daily needs.

His business is in \u201cCaba\u00f1as\u201d located in the southern part of the city, a marginalized residential area with rustic old houses, many without access to potable water, coexisting with manufacturing throughout the area. It has a warm climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 18-32 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nReynaldo has a dark complexion, with short black hair, brown eyes and wears glasses. He is of medium height, with a medium physique. His mother tongue of Guaran\u00ed is spoken in his area and he speaks conversational Spanish in general and for his business.\r\n\r\nHe lives at home with his parents in their own house which is made of bricks and has a thatched roof, potable water, electricity and a sewer system. \r\n\r\nHis business is running a cybercaf\u00e9. He has six networked computers with Internet access. Customers come to be with friends, others come alone to do homework, and others to entertain themselves surfing the web.\r\n\r\n\u201cI opened my business after a course in building computers and started with two slow computers and now I have six of the latest generation,\u201d he says. The advantage of his business is that it is new in the area and people there do not have access to other cybercaf\u00e9s.

His business involves purchasing and selling cattle. He is a good father and an enterprising, patient, understanding, responsible, and hardworking man. He started his business in the Palcoco community, which is located on the shores of the sacred Lake Titicaca about 30 kilometers from the city and 3930 meters above sea level. The climate is cold and dry, with a temperature that varies from 0-12 degrees Celsius throughout the day. \r\n\r\nMario is dark-skinned, has short black hair and brown eyes, and is short-statured and slim. His native language is Aymara, which he speaks at home. He speaks Spanish in the community and for commercial purposes. He lives with his son, who is starting school. They live in their own home, which is made of adobe and has a metal roof, electricity, and well water. \r\n\r\nHe raises and fattens dairy cattle for a living. He attends cattle exhibitions and purchases dairy cattle in order to raise and fatten them. He works with the cattle in his care and feeds them, so that he can sell the milk to cheese producers. He purchases totora reeds, rents fields to grow alfalfa, and ensures that the cattle eat every day so that they will produce the largest amount of milk possible.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to build a home made of brick and cement. He hopes to increase milk production by purchasing young dairy cattle to raise and fatten. This is his second loan in the 9 years since he started the business. For the reasons above, Mario is requesting a loan to purchase dairy cattle, rent pastures to raise and fatten dairy cattle, and build a brick home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1834748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase dairy cattle, rent pastures to raise and fatten the dairy cattle, and build a brick home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-17T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-16T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-14T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-16T04:00:00Z","amount":234.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T04:00:00Z","amount":236.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T04:00:00Z","amount":262.15},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T04:00:00Z","amount":257.99},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T04:00:00Z","amount":276.43},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T04:00:00Z","amount":268.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T04:00:00Z","amount":305.89},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T04:00:00Z","amount":312.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T04:00:00Z","amount":314.94},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T04:00:00Z","amount":344.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T04:00:00Z","amount":349.34},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T04:00:00Z","amount":364.68},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T04:00:00Z","amount":387.7},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T04:00:00Z","amount":397.73},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T04:00:00Z","amount":415.2},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T04:00:00Z","amount":435.23},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T04:00:00Z","amount":453.73},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T04:00:00Z","amount":383.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.63},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.31},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.95},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.18},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.54},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.55},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.47},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.17},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.63,"local_amount":470.58,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:35Z","rounded_local_amount":470.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564549},{"amount":38.24,"local_amount":262.21,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:14Z","rounded_local_amount":262.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046513},{"amount":37.8,"local_amount":259.21,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":259.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344333},{"amount":40.4,"local_amount":277.04,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":277.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554550},{"amount":38.79,"local_amount":266.01,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":266.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468656},{"amount":651.14,"local_amount":4464.95,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4466.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296514}],"funded_date":"2015-04-16T13:02:06Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meghan Rishel","image":1056096}},{"id":843559,"name":"031303050002.thi\u1ec7u \u0110\u00f4 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. S\u01a1n works in agriculture raising cattle.

He shares his life with his wife, who works; with his mother, who cares for the household; and with his children, who are not yet school age.  They live in the family house, which is made from brick and cement and has a corrugated metal roof.  They have running water, electricity, gas services, and indoor plumbing.\r\n\r\nHe has a metal working business.  He makes doors, windows, and gates.  He also makes roofing from corrugated metal.  \u201cI started my business as a helper to my uncle.  Then I had my family, and I became independent,\u201d he says.  The advantage to his business is the convenience of his big shop and its good location.  The disadvantage is that when he receives orders he hires helpers, and they are not steady.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to have a well-known metal working shop.  He wishes to buy sheet metal to make garage doors.  This is his first loan cycle with the institution in the five years that he has been independently engaged in this business activity.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Juan is requesting a loan to buy sheet metal to make garage doors. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":904.07,"image":{"id":1834695,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheet metal to make garage doors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-17T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-16T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-14T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-16T04:00:00Z","amount":661.03},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T04:00:00Z","amount":702.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T04:00:00Z","amount":718.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T04:00:00Z","amount":727.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T04:00:00Z","amount":790.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T04:00:00Z","amount":804.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T04:00:00Z","amount":840.32},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T04:00:00Z","amount":883.95},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T04:00:00Z","amount":905.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T04:00:00Z","amount":968.4},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T04:00:00Z","amount":998.32},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T04:00:00Z","amount":998.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.73},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.95},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.84},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.57,"local_amount":661.5,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:31:17Z","rounded_local_amount":669.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214410},{"amount":103.53,"local_amount":701.89,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":710.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564547},{"amount":106.37,"local_amount":721.15,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:14Z","rounded_local_amount":729.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046511},{"amount":107.04,"local_amount":725.67,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":734.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344331},{"amount":116.57,"local_amount":790.28,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":799.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554548},{"amount":118.73,"local_amount":804.54,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":814.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468654},{"amount":124.27,"local_amount":842.5,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":852.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296513},{"amount":129.99,"local_amount":881.77,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":892.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076744}],"funded_date":"2015-03-20T12:06:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":843625,"name":"S\u00e1u","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. S\u00e1u works in agriculture farming\u00a0food.<br \/><br \/>S\u00e1u is 40 years old and married with three children.

This 35-year-old widowed mother of one school-going boy hasn\u2019t let the hardships she has endured break her. She resides in the high density suburb of Glen Norah A, Harare. Her broiler chicken business is her source of livelihood. She started this business in 2012 after the death of her husband. With a small rental income from her tenants, she started her business. She started off with a batch of 50 chickens. She used to face challenges of delayed payment from her customers. This resulted in her not having chicken batches all the time, as she had to wait for her clients to pay her before she could purchase another batch.\r\n\r\nThe year 2013 was the turning point in her business. This is when two of her church mates and some friends approached her and told her about Thrive. They formed Ditiro group and joined Thrive Microfinance. Her 1st loan enabled her to increase her batch from 50 to 100 birds per batch. She was now able to keep chickens at various stages and not have to wait for her debtors to pay her. Her market has grown to include neighbours, church mates, and nursery schools. With her 2nd and 3rd loans, she continued to grow her business. She is now rearing batches of 200 at a time. With her current loan, Annamore is planning to extend her fowl run so as to further grow her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1830129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to expand her fowl run.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-03-17T16:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-16T16:40:10Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Primrose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annamore","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moreblessing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:53:27Z","rounded_local_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649745788},{"amount":350,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665235548},{"amount":350,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681541942},{"amount":350,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696747200},{"amount":350,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711678881},{"amount":350,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731183006}],"funded_date":"2015-03-20T12:45:43Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T17:29:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tom D"}},{"id":851324,"name":"Bliss Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is a married mother of three children, one boy and two girls, who are all going to school.

There is no service that you do not find at this bustling hub. There are grocery shops, pharmacies, saloons, tailors, mechanics, fruit and vegetable vendors, etc. It is here that you find Loice Chiwenga plying her trade. She sells maize at Current shops. Her business is situated next to a busy grinding mill, making her maize sell fast. She sells an average of 2 tonnes a month.\r\n\r\nLoice is a member of El Shaddai group. She is 38, married, and a mother to school-going children. Loice and her group members joined Thrive in April 2013. Her group is in its 4th loan cycle with Thrive Microfinance. She started her business as a cross-border trader plying her trade in neighbouring South Africa and Zambia. Her business was failing as she often had too little capital to meet all her customers\u2019 needs. Also crossing the border frequently was not easy for her as she had no one to leave her small children with. \r\n\r\nAfter receiving training from Thrive, she decided to venture into a business that did not cross borders and that was sustainable throughout the year. She started selling maize. Maize is the staple food in Zimbabwe and it is bought throughout the year. Loice hasn\u2019t looked back; her business has grown and her quality of life has improved tremendously. She now sends her children to boarding school and has joined a housing co-operative where she is paying monthly contributions for her stand. Her future plans are to buy a 2 tonne truck that will help her in her maize business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1833392,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To expand her maize wholesaling business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-03-17T16:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-16T16:40:10Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Loice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Spiwe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":283.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":283.33,"local_amount":283.33,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:53:27Z","rounded_local_amount":283.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649745789},{"amount":283.33,"local_amount":283.33,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":283.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665235549},{"amount":282.34,"local_amount":282.34,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":282.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681541943},{"amount":284,"local_amount":284,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":284,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696747201},{"amount":284,"local_amount":284,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":284,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711678882},{"amount":283,"local_amount":283,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":283,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731183007}],"funded_date":"2015-03-19T00:56:39Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T17:29:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tom D"}},{"id":853539,"name":"Lerato Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As you get to Glenview furniture complex in Harare, you catch the sound of local highlife music, traffic sounds, and vendors calling out to attract their customers.

She is married and, together with her husband, raising two young children. Shahlojon is very polite, gentle and kind person by nature. She loves her work because she works with children. Shahlojon is a teacher of her native language at a secondary school. In her free time, Shahlojon is involved in sewing European and school clothing. She has loved to sew and work with a sewing machine since her childhood. Shahlojon has been seriously involved in sewing for 9 years now.

She works hard to augment the family's income to meet their daily personal expenses, support household needs and be able to send her children to school. \r\n\r\nMarites operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five PHP's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 700 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her general store business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as canned goods, instant noodles, beverages and toiletries to sell at her small store. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her, for it will surely cover their daily sustenance and fund her children's education.\r\n\r\nMarites hopes to maintain and grow her business so the family can lead a better life. She strives hard to give her children the best education and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1834035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items, beverages and toiletries to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-03-17T17:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-16T17:20:04Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marites","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":158.35,"local_amount":6666.65,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:49:13Z","rounded_local_amount":7023.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187231},{"amount":126.68,"local_amount":5333.32,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5618.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536258},{"amount":126.64,"local_amount":5333.32,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5618.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017473},{"amount":63.33,"local_amount":2666.71,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2809.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313890}],"funded_date":"2015-03-17T18:00:25Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":854099,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is a married mother of three children.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The profits from the business will be used to pay school fees of her children and to increase her savings.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.

Yadira sells Yanbal, Avon, and Belcorp products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and women\u2019s accessories).  She conducts her sales by going door-to-door, but she also sells from her home whenever her customers need something.  Yadira makes her rounds in the morning while her children are in school.  She extends credit for her products and collects payment every 8 or 15 days.  Yadira has been in this business for more than two years.
