Her brother was the one who started the business, and he later transferred it to Olga. Today, she sells goods on a cash basis, every day of the week, working from 8 in the morning until 9 at night. Most of her customers are neighbors in the area. Her goal is to have a broader inventory of products in order to earn more money, since she dreams of completing her professional degree. However, her greatest challenge is to successfully increase her working capital. This is the reason that she is requesting a Kiva loan, which is her first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With it, she will buy groceries, meats, beverages and other basic staple goods which her customers from the neighborhood buy every day and which turn over easily. With this investment, she will expand the variety of her offerings, and this is precisely why her Kiva loan will be a successful investment.

Her client list includes NGO\u2019s, small and medium companies, and the locals. \r\n\r\nThe economic meltdown here in Zimbabwe made it difficult for her to keep the shop open, leading to its closure. As she struggled to keep her tailoring enterprise open, Oxceria heard about Thrive microfinance.

She then went on to apply for a group loan with her friends after completing training. She has not given up her dreams of making her own interior d\u00e9cor name.

On average, she can generate an earning of USD 2.00 per day.\r\n\r\nThe current farmland that she owns is small and it can provide less benefit to her. She wants to enlarge her farmland area but she cannot afford to do so. Therefore, now she would like to get a Kiva loan to buy a plot of farmland for growing rice. She hopes this additional farmland will help to improve her living condition. She is thankful to all lenders for their financial support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":441,"image":{"id":1834134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is thankful for the lenders for their financial support towards poor people. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":105,"image":{"id":1834174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Well digging","sector":"Construction","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to dig a well","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12 105.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2015-03-17T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-16T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kim Oan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2017-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2017-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2017-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711718254},{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731006979},{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752095373}],"funded_date":"2015-03-17T23:09:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":853213,"name":"Khady's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe de 21 membres fait partie du Banc Villageois qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9e 16 avril 2010.

They have potable water, electricity and sewer connections. Her business is selling food such as hamburgers, grilled meat, sausages and others. She carries out her work twice a day, at lunchtime and dinnertime. \"I started in my work as a kitchen assistant, and later I obtained a loan and opened my own business,\" she reports.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.

Her business is the sale of traditional food. She is enterprising, friendly, active, dedicated, consistent, responsible, and hardworking. Her business is done in the \u2018Kalahuira\u2019 area, located northwest of the city. It is the largest municipality of the area. Many residents raise sheep. The climate is cold and dry with a temperature that varies during the day from 2-16 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nLeydy has dark skin, long black hair tied back, brown eyes, short stature, and average physique. Her mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1 that she speaks in the family. Additionally, she speaks Spanish for general culture and for use in her business. Her life is spent at home with her parents. She has older sister who studies and she assists her with college costs. They live in a home built of brick and cement that has electricity. They receive water from a nearby pond and do not have a sewage system.\r\n\r\nHer business is the sale of traditional food, such as: Plato pace\u00f1o (potatoes, beans, corn, and fried cheese), Fricas\u00e9 (pork soup with ground corn and chili), Chairo (potato soup with mutton), Llauchas (empanadas stuffed with melted cheese), Humintas de choclo (ground corn with cheese, wrapped in its husk, boiled or baked), and others. She works from Monday to Sunday in a room at home with a kitchen and chairs in the street so that customers can sit while eating. \"My grandmother taught me to cook to have a job and be independent...\", she says. Her dream is to have a popular restaurant. \r\n\r\nShe wants to renew her cookware, such as pots, pans, knives, and others, because the ones she has no longer serve. This is her first loan with the institution in the two years that she has been doing this activity independently. It is for these reasons that Leydy asks for a loan to purchase pots, pans, and other kitchen utensils and to help her sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":458.27,"image":{"id":1833571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase pots, pans, and other kitchen utensils for cooking and help her sister.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-17T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-16T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leydy Vanesa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":318.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":339.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":366.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":370.56},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":391.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":394.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":429.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":443.63},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":456.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":484},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":501.04},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":502.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.93},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.16},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.77,"local_amount":318.46,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":327.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214401},{"amount":50.93,"local_amount":339.53,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:30Z","rounded_local_amount":349.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564535},{"amount":55.01,"local_amount":366.74,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":377.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046500},{"amount":55.58,"local_amount":370.56,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":381.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344320},{"amount":58.79,"local_amount":392.3,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:58Z","rounded_local_amount":403.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554538},{"amount":59.24,"local_amount":394.56,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":406,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468646},{"amount":64.4,"local_amount":429.36,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":441.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296507},{"amount":66.55,"local_amount":443.63,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:18Z","rounded_local_amount":456.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076739}],"funded_date":"2015-03-25T03:27:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brian DuVerneay","image":1385689}},{"id":855113,"name":"William","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"William es el propietario de un almac\u00e9n de repuestos y autopartes de veh\u00edculos. \u00c9l es un hombre de 55 a\u00f1os de edad y padre de dos hijos en las edades de 24 y 29 a\u00f1os, a quienes sue\u00f1a con ver convertidos en profesionales de \u00e9xito.  \nEn el a\u00f1o 2010 un amigo de William le sugiri\u00f3 la idea de abrir un almac\u00e9n para vender autopartes y repuestos para veh\u00edculos, como efectivamente lo hizo.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain undeserved by financial institutions.

When it's time to grow beans and corn, he sets aside part of the harvest for his family's own consumption and sells the rest, earning income to pay for the household expenses. When it's time to harvest coffee, he does that. His wife helps by tending the home.\r\n\r\nHe needs this loan to buy fertilizers and seed and to pay for manual labor for planting.

The profits from the business will be used to pay school fees for her children.<br \/><br \/>The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions.

","en":"Hernando is 68 years old, a widow, and the father of five children. He was helping his brother, who manufactured industrial metal and rubber spare parts, back in 1994, when his brother suggested that Hernando learn the business so he could earn a living. \r\n\r\nHernando accepted his brother's advice and spent the next 10 years working in his brother's shop. Hernando then went into business for himself, building up a customer base of established companies in his city. Hernando buys raw materials such as iron, bronze, aluminum, and hardware, paying cash. He then provides industrial machine parts to his customers, who either pay in cash or buy on credit.\r\n\r\nHernando hopes to make improvements to his workshop by purchasing more specialized machines. He also wants to keep providing support his children and grandchildren, helping to meet their needs. Hernando is currently applying for a Kiva loan via the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and will use the loan funds for the purchase of materials and tools, such as galvanized sheeting and spare parts that he needs to boost productivity and make improvements to his shop. This loan will allow Hernando to employ more people, meet the needs of his current customers, and attract new ones. Hernando's loan will then be a success. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":273.75,"image":{"id":1835416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to buy materials and tools, such as galvanized sheeting and spare parts.

Besides enjoying, dancing, participating in the Battle of Flowers, the Gauchema, the children's parade amongst other activities. She enjoys the absolute burst of joy that emanates from her neighborhood and she manages to sell lots of hats, disguises, and accessories related to the carnival from the end of the year until the 4 most relaxed days that the joyful city of Barranquilla has. <br \/><br \/>Her preparations begin at the year end as pre-carnival begins and with it her high point of sales. Maria started her business in 1990 as result of a severe economic crisis as her husband was left unemployed. A family member was ready to support them and loaned her a small amount of money with which she started her business selling assorted merchandise. She joined up with multinational companies which expedited her offering of diverse products through catalogs which she still does today. <br \/><br \/>She makes her sales in cash and on credit with family, friends, neighbors and people refereed by her clients. She sells daily without regard to the time demands of each buyer.

She is a simple housewife. Her husband has been running a movie-making business for the past 18 years. Her husband is only responsible to feed the entire family and manage the overall household. Madiha's husband needs to buy different types of items, e.g. camera, wires, video cassettes for movie making. Due to insufficient financial resources he is not in a position to buy these items to fulfill his needs. Therefore Madiha has planned to help her husband by requesting a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan her husband can buy all of the above items relevant to his business and enable himself to earn maximum profitable income by providing better services.\r\nFor this financial

is a 49-year-old woman who lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Her husband has been working in a public sector organization for many years and he is responsible for fulfilling the needs of the family. Shamim is also providing sewing services and earns an income to contribute with her husband to manage the household.\r\n\r\nShe needs different kinds of goods e.g. needles, threads, pieces of cloth, machine oil, etc. for her business purpose, but due to insufficient financial means, she is unable to purchase these accessories. Therefore, she has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her to purchase these accessories and will also help her to increase her monthly sales and profit by providing better sewing services.\r\n\r\nShamim is very thankful to Kiva and

Her husband is the only one responsible for fulfilling the needs of the entire family.\r\n\r\nShehnaz's husband needs to buy different types of tailoring accessories, e.g., pieces of clothes, laces, needles and sewing machine accessories. But due to some financial constraints, her husband is not in a suitable condition to buy the above items for his business purpose. Therefore Shehnaz has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan, she will financially assist her husband to purchase these tailoring accessories to fulfill his business needs, so that he can earn more a profitable income. Shehnaz is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for this financial assistance.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to rent more land to cultivate.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Bridgit\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 7.25 acres of land and purchase a total of 12 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1790273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-03-18T05:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-17T05:00:03Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bridgit","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adijah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Winrose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harrison K","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Resah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malezi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enecy W","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":119400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":853555,"name":"Akou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Akou est une femme mari\u00e9e de 47 ans qui vit \u00e0 Ago\u00e8 avec ses quatre enfants.

Koech also holds a salary-paying job. \r\n\r\nIn a bid to grow his rural enterprise, Koech is seeking a loan investment of KES 60,000 from Kiva lenders to buy an additional dairy cow.

The increase in income from this investment will be plowed back into the business as capital for expansion.

He has been a member for a few years now, having joined the program in 2007 and, although he is the only person featured in the above picture, is representing his group of eight farmers in Webuye District, Kenya.\r\n\r\nFordson is often described by his community as a very friendly person and decided to be the one to represent his group because he wanted to spread the story of One Acre Fund farmers. Like many of his fellow farmers, Fordson decided to be part of the One Acre Fund community in order to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds.

She received her primary education at the community school but then decided to study secondary because she enjoyed studying.  She also helped her mother at home and learned about housework.  Now she is married and has two children.  She and her husband grow coffee and basic grains.\r\n\r\nThere is no electricity in her community and she would like to have electric light at home.  Therefore she is requesting a loan to buy a solar energy system which would be very helpful in the household when she gets up early in the morning to make meals for the workers during harvest season.  Now she has to use a lantern and at night she uses candles to go to bed.  With the solar panel it will all change and the children will even be able to study.

Having a sixth cow will increase her milk production and the number of animals (asset base) on the farm. \r\n\r\nYour investment will enable Rebecca to make more income for her family, and to have more collateral to leverage her business in future to drive growth. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":304.67,"image":{"id":1834543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bomet","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-18T12:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-17T12:00:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.46,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rebecca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":41600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2944.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3118.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3209.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.71},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3400.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3499.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3601.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3707.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3815.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3927.02},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4041.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.62,"local_amount":2944.15,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3081.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636265270},{"amount":32.88,"local_amount":2879.75,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3013.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601438},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":3184.14,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3332.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459959},{"amount":37.41,"local_amount":3302.75,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3456.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.3,"payment_id":681378364},{"amount":35.57,"local_amount":3161.36,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3308.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.53,"payment_id":696588053},{"amount":43.16,"local_amount":3951.45,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4135.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.96,"payment_id":711506341},{"amount":40.85,"local_amount":3663.12,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3833.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.98,"payment_id":731023177},{"amount":40.36,"local_amount":3595.02,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3762.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.69,"payment_id":752111328}],"funded_date":"2015-03-18T14:41:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":854498,"name":"Abizerwa Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"ABIZERWA is a group led by Yvonna, who is 35 years old.

She will now be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. With the profits that she gains from this year\u2019s harvest, she plans to save more money for the future.\r\n\r\nTopisha and her group will receive a total of 9 solar lights as well as input loans of maize and fertilizer to plant a total of 4.25 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1794601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-03-18T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-17T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Topisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliud","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Protus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abart","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Titus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":87130,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87130}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-22T16:38:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Peggy","image":1683516}},{"id":852419,"name":"Maa Mangala Group-A","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kamala, the lady standing first from the left in the photograph, is a 41-year-old widow lady living with her daughter, age 13, and son, age 9.

She is 49 years old and has children. She solely supports her children through all of her hard work. She operates a junk shop to provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nTrash is not actively segregated in the Philippines and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, and papers. They sell these items to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries and factories. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, Marissa is taking out a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she dreams to expand her business. She also operates a business that buys and sells frozen foods and she desires that this business will thrive more. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and also draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

She started the business just after she completed her catering course. Her husband provided the capital to start the business and to meet her family needs in the meantime. Her main customers are student and neigbhours. Working six days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about SLL 1,135,000 every month from her business. \r\n\r\nSobie would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. Sobie has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy more crates of soft drinks, assorted provisions and bags of rice. The previous loan has helped improve her business and her living standard as well. She hopes that this loan will help to expand her business and generate more income, and that it will also help to achieve her future plans. In the future, Sobie still plans to expand the business and provide quality education for her children.

Quiche is one of the most poverty stricken of the country\u2019s 23 departments, with an incidence of poverty of over 80 percent. The department, named after the Maya-K\u2019iche people, has a diverse and complicated history. Most recently, in the 1980\u2019s, violence from the civil war tore through the region, displacing and killing thousands of indigenous people. \t  \r\n\r\nIn San Pedro Jocopilas, eight indigenous K\u2019iche women have joined to form the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank San Pablo. The women, who are finishing their third loan cycle with Friendship Bridge, are applying for another loan to support their various small business. \r\n\r\nJuana, a 28-year-old member of San Pablo, has been making and selling typical Maya-K\u2019iche skirts for over three years. When Juana started her business, she sewed and sold artisanal skirts to small stores and vendors in Santa Cruz and other surrounding towns. In the next few years, using the connections she made as a supplier, she expanded her business to employ three women from a small rural community who have helped her expand her production capacity. Juana is applying for another loan to buy the necessary capital to continue producing and selling traditional skirts. With this loan, Juana is hoping to maintain her existing business and to build capital in order to potentially open her own storefront. With the support if Kiva investors, Juana will have the opportunity to continue gaining business experience and to start working toward her goal of opening her own store.\r\n\r\nThe eight unified women of the Trust Bank are dedicated to working together and supporting each other through the difficulties they face trying to maintain and grow their business. Additionally, their loan officer, as part of Friendship Bridge\u2019s microcredit plus program, provides the women with monthly educational training in their native language of K\u2019iche. The monthly non-formal education covers topics ranging from women\u2019s empowerment, financial literacy, and health and medicinal plants. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2904.12,"image":{"id":1834706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy the necessary capital to continue producing and selling traditional skirts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Quiche","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-03-18T15:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-17T15:40:01Z","loan_amount":4975,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Savina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta \t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aura Marilena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maxi Lucrecia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Santos ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":37800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":4975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3152.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3152.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3152.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3152.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3152.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3152.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3152.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3152.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3152.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3152.2},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3152.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3125.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":414.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":414.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":414.87},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":414.87},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.87},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":414.88,"local_amount":3152.2,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3161.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649567060},{"amount":414.88,"local_amount":3152.2,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3161.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665049216},{"amount":414.88,"local_amount":3152.2,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3161.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347075},{"amount":414.87,"local_amount":3152.2,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:49:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3161.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696557432},{"amount":414.87,"local_amount":3152.2,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3161.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711472392},{"amount":414.87,"local_amount":3152.2,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3161.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730991479},{"amount":414.87,"local_amount":3152.2,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3161.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752079747}],"funded_date":"2015-03-19T15:26:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":853677,"name":"Epouses Des Enseignants N\u00b0 6 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le GIE \u00ab Epouses des enseignants n\u00b06 \u00bb, regroupent des femmes enseignantes et\/ou dont les maris sont enseignants.

They sell these items to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries and factories. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, Leanette is taking out a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes that her business will continue to become successful, and she dreams that her children will finish their studies.

Together, they all make bags from paper and also run a small shop selling fresh bodi and papad, which are traditional spicy snacks made from ground wheat and lentils. They also make paper carry-bags that they sell to other business owners in their village. The family makes enough to get by on, but still struggle to meet monthly expenses, as they belong to a poor family and must support themselves. \r\n\r\nSantoshi is therefore asking for a loan of 12,000 INR for each group member. She will begin to purchase items in bulk and expand the business. Particularly, items like flour, salt, and oil will be much cheaper in large amounts, and she will be able to earn a larger profit. She hopes to build up the business into one of the main bodi shops in town, while continuing to bring in income from the paper bags.\r\n\r\nJainasen and Sharojin are also engaged in the same type of business as Santoshi.
