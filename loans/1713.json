Engineering. Here is his story:<br \/><br \/>\u201cMy name is Sanjar. I am an 18-year-old single student. I live with my mother and younger sister, who is a schoolgirl. My mother is a doctor. She is so proud of being a doctor, to help people and save their lives, but, unfortunately, she earns little, and we usually face financial difficulties at home. Thank God we have my grandfather, who is a pensioner. He helps us as he can, but, of course, he can\u2019t do much. My parents divorced about 10 years ago, and my father left us. We don\u2019t keep in touch with him, and he doesn\u2019t pay us alimony.<br \/><br \/>From childhood my weakness is an education. I can say I am eager to know and learn something new every day. I have a dream to do a Masters in the USA, but to realize this plan, I have to build a good background here and now. The Department of Software Engineering is one of the best and most prestigious departments at the university. A number of AUCA alumni are employed at NASA, as well as branches of the US military. It is difficult to study, because I have a heavy course load. I have no time to be bored. It should be noted that students in this department are really strong. I am happy to be one of them.<br \/><br \/>I am a studious, bright and ambitious person. I believe that in my future I can achieve all my goals, one of which is to be able to support my family. I\u2019m sure that education is the key to the country\u2019s development. It is the investment for the future of every nation. I am hopeful that lenders will approve my loan so I can achieve my dreams and help my family have a better future.\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1834893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She started with a limited supply of vegetables like tomatoes and potatoes and grew to sell more than seven varieties such as brinjal (eggplant), cucumbers, beans, carrots, and radishes. She has developed a very good relationship with her customers in the village, as she sells fresh and high-quality vegetables. She likes the fact that she can cater to the needs of the people in her village. \r\n\r\nNow she has a new idea of doing maize cultivation, for which she has requested a loan to utilize for the resources necessary to grow maize. A portion of the loan amount will help her to purchase sugarcane plants, fertilizers, and insecticides, and to cover operational expenses like labor charges."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1833432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for resources such as maize seeds, fertilizers, and insecticides for maize cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Jeypore, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2015-03-18T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-17T17:00:05Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Namita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damaynti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matimani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":36000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-24T10:27:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":853153,"name":"Maa Gayatri Group-D","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sunamani, the lady standing on the left in the picture, is 31 years old, a married woman living with her parent-in-laws, husband and her two children.

She is a single mother and has one child. She is employed to a garment factory in Cavite through the auspices of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nAlma works as a tailor. She does the sewing and designing of clothing apparel according to the company or client\u2019s demand. She sews clothes using a sewing machine or other stitching machines, but also often does hand stitching of edges and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Alma is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses. They often have no access to savings or credit, a situation that made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Alma is asking for your assistance to prevent her from engaging with loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative, and she had no problem in returning it since the loan payment was being deducted every pay day. She looks forward to your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will also use the loan to pay for her pawned ATM card.\r\n\r\nAlma hopes to give her family a good life in the future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n*The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills at a quality for jobs, to cultivate savings consciousness, and to provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n**CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine.

He is a 55-year-old adult and a married father of three children not in school; his spouse is a housewife. He attended school and dropped out prematurely in primary school in order to join his father in farming. He reads and writes the national language; he lives in a rural area in Mali with his family. \r\n\r\nN\u00e9gueting raises sheep in addition to being a farmer. He purchase underweight rams, fattens them, and resells them to animal traders and to butchers. He supplies himself from the local markets and resells his products there. He makes a profit of 25,000 francs CFA per head. His profits are used to improve his family\u2019s living conditions. \r\n\r\nN\u00e9gueting has turned to RMCR to bolster his capacity to do business.

She manages their household while operating their business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAngelina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHPs-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAngelina dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAntonia operates a retail business. What she basically does is buy general herbal\/organic products from wholesalers, then sell them with a little profit. Her products are herbal coffee, supplements and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAntonia hopes that her business will continue to be successful.

She has six grown-up and independent children who are all married, with the exception of her youngest son. Aisara has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, she practices crop farming. Aisara has a 1.0 hectare plot of rented land and her own 0.80 hectare plot of land on which she grows wheat, corn, cucumbers and tomatoes for sale. Thanks to the hard work of Aisara and her close-knit family, Aisara's business brings in an average monthly income of up to 15,000 som (KGS). For the further development of her farm, Aisara turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan for 120,000 som (KGS) to buy fertilizers, seeds and nitrates for cultivating the land. This will allow Aisara to grow organic produce. Aisara plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further development of her business so that she can save money for her youngest son's wedding."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":487.5,"image":{"id":1813435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds, fertilizers and nitrates to grow organic vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Mamajan village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-03-18T20:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-17T20:20:06Z","loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.79,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aisara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":487.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":460.71,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:04:47Z","rounded_local_amount":30127.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.79,"payment_id":752025731}],"funded_date":"2015-03-21T22:22:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":837600,"name":"Margareth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margareth is 37 years old and lives outside of Honiara city with her four children.

Massachusetts an exceptional early childhood education and childcare experience for their children. Jennifer had worked in education for over 15 years, and her experiences with the Montessori system made her determined to expand access to this teaching philosophy that emphasizes independent learning for children and respect for children\u2019s differing development rates. \r\n\r\nShe decided to open a school in her hometown of Auburn, Mass. In less than three years, her school has grown from six to 25 students, and currently serves children ages 15 months to 5 years old. Her efforts have been well-received by the community, and she has observed steady annual increases in enrollment. Recently, the school was able to move to a larger facility. However, the expenses associated with the move, hiring new staff, and purchasing new equipment have depleted the school\u2019s savings.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Jennifer will be able to pay her employees and school building rent through this summer, giving her enough time to regenerate profits from her growing school. In order to support herself and her two daughters, as well as expand the educational services of her school, Jennifer hopes to soon own her own school building, and expand resources for her children.

Meet Catherine, a youthful 26-year-old mum and a wise farmer whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Nkubu, in the Central region of Kenya. Catherine is happily married and together with her husband, blessed with a lovely child. \n\nFor the past five years, she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been growing maize, fruits, and tomatoes and keeping dairy cows. Catherine has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family, \u201cshe said. \n\nCatherine mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Catherine is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge, hence she suffers so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetable and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price and through this loan, Catherine is going to achieve her dream and goals. \n\nAccessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Catherine feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Catherine will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market and she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market and increase her income level. Catherine is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work.

She has two sons (ages 10 and 8) and a 16-year-old daughter.  Her business involves recycling rubber tires.  <br \/><br \/>Nicasia is a good mother who is enterprising, strong, patient, responsible, and hardworking.  Her business operates in an area to the south of the city, which is a marginalized residential district.  The homes there are old and made of basic materials.  Many of them do not have access to running water.  These homes coexist with factories located throughout the area.  The weather is temperate, with a temperature that varies throughout the day between 18-25 degrees Celsius.  <br \/><br \/>Nicasia has a dark complexion, long black braided hair, brown eyes, short stature, and a robust physique.  She wears traditional apparel (hat, shawl, and skirt).  Her native language is Quechua, which she speaks in this area, but she also speaks Spanish to integrate herself into the general culture and to conduct business.  Nicasia shares her life with her husband, who works and is constantly traveling.  Her children are in school.  They live in their own home, which is made of adobe and has a corrugated metal roof.  Their home has well water, electricity, and sewage services.  Her business involves manufacturing different products out of recycled materials obtained from automobile tires.  These products include planters, rugs, slip-on sandals, children\u2019s swing sets, storage containers, and other items.  The advantage of this business is that she has plenty of material to work with.  There are a lot of tires that are left out in the streets and in vacant lots, but have not reached the landfill.  \u201cI started my business with the help of my sister.  At first we only made rugs and sandals.  Later on we proceeded to make planters.  Now we specialize in making eco-friendly furniture,\u201d says Nicasia.  Her dream is to have a large eco-friendly furniture business.  She would like to buy materials for her work such as paint, brushes, screws, and other supplies for the process of recycling automobile tires and making eco-friendly furniture.  Nicasia is in her first loan cycle with Emprender.  She has been in this business for 10 years.  <br \/><br \/>For the reasons previously mentioned, Nicasia is requesting a loan so that she can recycle automobile tires and make eco-friendly furniture, which will help save the planet."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1833797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials and supplies for recycling automobile tires and making eco-friendly furniture.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-18T21:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-17T21:00:05Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nicasia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-13T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-11T04:00:00Z","amount":791.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T04:00:00Z","amount":759.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T04:00:00Z","amount":833.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T04:00:00Z","amount":846.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T04:00:00Z","amount":878.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T04:00:00Z","amount":930.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T04:00:00Z","amount":963.41},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":996.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.02},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.07},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.14,"local_amount":793.16,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":802.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214406},{"amount":114.03,"local_amount":778.75,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":787.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564540},{"amount":118.94,"local_amount":812.28,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":821.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046505},{"amount":123.99,"local_amount":846.76,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:21Z","rounded_local_amount":856.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344325},{"amount":128.65,"local_amount":878.61,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":888.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554543},{"amount":136.29,"local_amount":930.72,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":941.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468649},{"amount":286.96,"local_amount":1959.72,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1982.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296510}],"funded_date":"2015-03-19T13:00:12Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":842828,"name":"Marlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marlene is a 63-year old widow and a mother of seven children.

","en":"Maria Claudia is a 39-year-old woman. She is married and is the mother of two children, who are 18 and 21 years old. She still recalls the start of her business on January 25, 2009, when a director with a commercial business of products by catalog brought her on board to explain to her the benefits of joining a business activity and of offering goods through magazines that the business supplied. Maria, seeing how her friends had done in this work, decided to start her own. Little by little, her business grew and later, she added the photocopying and transcription services. \r\n\r\nHer sales are made in cash or on credit to the neighbors in the area where she lives and to referrals. For these people, she buys goods in specialized stores in the center of the city. She works daily from 8 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nAt present, she is applying her a Kiva loan, which is the first loan she has taken from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. Through the loan, she will buy a photocopier to grow her capacity to provide this service in her business. With this investment, she hopes to grow her sales. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she dreams of having a bigger location. She also dreams of supporting the higher education of her children, and she will not rest until she makes them professionals. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":258.84,"image":{"id":1834732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to buy a photocopier.

Ayesha has been running her own beauty salon for the past 16 years. She also contributes her income with her husband's to manage the household. \n \nShe needs to buy different types of cosmetics, i.e. creams, hair brushes, and other accessories for her beauty salon but due to financial constraints, she is not capable of buying these items for her business purposes. Therefore, Ayesha has applied for a Kiva loan. This loan will help her to buy the relevant items for her business purpose so that she can provide better services to her customers. It will also help her to earn the maximum profitable income to fulfill the needs of her business and family.\n\nFor this financial assistance, Ayesha is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC

Before, her husband works as a fisherman in their community. However, working as a fisherman only earns them PhP 400 per day and is hardly enough to cover their most basic daily expenses.  \n\nTo improve their income, Julita decided to bought a second hand boat in which they repaid on monthly basis and used it in their fishing business. Their income increased to PhP 900- 1,200 daily and they were able to repay the boat after a year. \n\nJulita and her husband wanted to expand the business and buy another boat however limitations in the capital get in their way in as much as education expenses for their children are also increasing. \n\nHer first loan amounting to PhP 5,000 was added to their savings to finally buy another boat for the fishing business. From the series of loans, their business and their life dramatically improved. From 1 boat,  they now have 3 boats. They were able to buy a second hand jeep which they use to transport their seafood catches to the market. They were also able to buy a freezer to stock their seafood catches in order to maintain their freshness while not yet transported to be sold.  They are also able to  employ 6 fishermen in the community. Julita was also able to set up a sari-sari store (small grocery store) in front of their house. More importantly, Julita was able to see her 2 children graduating in college. \n\nToday, Julita is requesting for a loan amounting to PhP 30,000. With the amount she wanted to buy 2 fishing new nets and materials for building their 4th fishing boat. Julita dreams of having her last child finish college and also aspires to continue helping her neighbors by employing them in their family's business. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1820307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy  2 new fishing nets and materials to build a new fishing boat for their fishing business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":389,"posted_date":"2015-03-18T21:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-17T21:20:07Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.18},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.18},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.18},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":253.14,"local_amount":11250,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":11317.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636453897},{"amount":210.95,"local_amount":9375,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":9431.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649722709},{"amount":168.73,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":7545.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665212916},{"amount":42.18,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T16:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1886.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681573196}],"funded_date":"2015-03-18T21:27:03Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T16:39:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":843990,"name":"Marcelo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marcelo is 57 years old.

One of the challenges she has been experiencing over the years is milling cereal grains into a cookable form- flour. This has also taken a toll on her sales since end-user clients want flour, not seeds. <br \/><br \/>Her answer to this problem is to start a cereal grain milling business where locals can cheaply and conveniently process their produce into flour for food and\/or sale. This investment will increase her family's income and elevate their livelihood. And thanks to you, this investment will also help her community to have a place near their home where they can process food for consumption and for sale."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":438.62,"image":{"id":1835057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a grain milling machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-18T21:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-17T21:40:07Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.03,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Callen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.14},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.27,"local_amount":9979.79,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":10300.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601441},{"amount":101.65,"local_amount":9097.33,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":9389.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.69,"payment_id":681378368},{"amount":101.2,"local_amount":9392.31,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":9694.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.46,"payment_id":711506344},{"amount":116.47,"local_amount":10519.72,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":10858.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.88,"payment_id":752111331}],"funded_date":"2015-03-19T11:07:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Benjamin","image":1467297}},{"id":854854,"name":"Lisilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lisilda is a married woman with five children.

Her main income source is from selling milk. As her only daughter grows by the day, so does Ruth's financial obligation towards her health, education and general well-being. One of the ways she plans to increase her income is by increasing the volume of milk her cows produce. What better way to achieve this than by improving the animals' feed and water intake.\r\nRuth is seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter. This machine will chop hay into small and even pieces that cows enjoy eating. Traditionally, people use machetes to prepare feed. The problems arises when cows become selective, just like small children, when eating. Using a chaff cutter solves this because different varieties of fodder will be fed into the machine which chop and spew the mixture in smithereens. This eliminates any chance of cows being selective, and ensures that they get all the right nutrients and minerals from everything in the rations. The increased income from milk sales will be used by Ruth to meet her family's basic needs and wants.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She was able to purchase additional grocery products needed to increase her product inventory. The loan also helped her provide for the educational expenses of her children and pay for their daily needs.<br \/><br \/>She is very positive that she could improve her business more if you will lend her an amount of 20,000 PHP. This new loan will go to additional stock of groceries, toiletries, and beverages. Her customers will be likely to buy more items if she has more of her products displayed at her store. An increase in sales will also result in a significant increase in profit, which will also result in her business becoming viable and sustainable. Simultaneously, she could sustain the needs of her family.<br \/><br \/>Aside from her variety store, Edna also operates a utility vehicle for transportation service, and she wishes to add more units to increase her profit. She dreams that her family will always be completely happy.

The main challenge she is facing is lack of enough capital to expand. Therefore, she is applying for a loan to plant more crops. Most of the money will be spent on labour since digging gigantic holes on the ground that will act as beds for the crop is very labour intensive. She will also use the money to buy farm tools and farm inputs. \r\n\r\nIncome from this investment will help her to provide a better living condition for her family and better education for her child.

","en":"Gulzita is 31 years old, married, and the mother of four children.  She has a college education and she works as a Russian teacher in a school.  She has also been involved in agriculture and animal husbandry for the past eight years.  She started her farming business with an initial capital of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has three hectares of leased land as well as 1.8 hectare of her own land, on which she cultivates beans annually for resale.  She also owns one cow.

She is married and is the mother of two children who are still small. Norma has worked growing coffee for approximately 5 years. Her parents always worked growing coffee and she learned the trade from them. They taught her that knowing how to manage, take care, and provide an adequate maintenance to the plantation is profitable in these zones, because of the altitude and good climate. That is how Norma learned to grow coffee. When the harvest is completed, it is taken to the stores who offer the best price for its quality. Her challenge nowadays is the high cost of the agricultural inputs such as manure and fertilizers to help maintain the fields.

She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs, and to send their children to school. \r\nRowilma operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns her income by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from her small general store, she is also a dealer of personal products. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of Php 900 a day. \r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items like canned goods and instant noodles. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are their source to meet their daily expenses and to send their children to school. She thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her.\r\nRowilma hopes to maintain and grow her business. She dreams of seeing her children become professionals. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1835388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-03-19T06:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-18T06:20:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rowilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2950.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187250},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3687.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536278},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2950.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017493},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.29,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1475.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313910}],"funded_date":"2015-03-19T09:31:00Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":855103,"name":"Benjamin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benjamin is a Kiva borrower.

She wants to have plenty of inventory on the shelves to meet the demands of her current customers and attract new ones. A small portion of her loan will be used to buy firewood to resell.

A loan from Thrive Microfinance has helped Maidei increase the quantities of the goods she buys in South Africa. This has helped her increase the stock in her flea market.
