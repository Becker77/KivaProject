The area is known for all types of commerce where restaurants, bookstores, hotels, markets, offices, galleries, and universities, etc. coexist side by side.  It has a hot, tropical climate with a temperature that varies between 22 and 35 degrees centigrade in the daytime.  \r\n\r\nAna has a dark complexion, long chestnut hair that she wears tied back.  She is short and has a medium physique.  Her maternal language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family.  She speaks Spanish with the general public and for her business.  She shares her life with her life partner, who is a builder.  They live in a rented room that is built from brick and cement and has a metal sheeting roof.  They have electricity, running water, and indoor plumbing.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling chicken soup and cold soft drinks in an itinerant manner.  She pushes a two wheeled cart where she has a large pot wrapped in thick fabric to conserve the heat.  To the side she has a container of ice to chill the soft drinks.  She conducts her business Mondays through Fridays at lunch time.  On the week-ends the area is left with very little activity, and there are very few sales.  \u201cI work independently, and I have customers who work in construction where I take lunch every day,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to establish herself in her area and to continue working with construction customers.  She wishes to expand her business by purchasing a hamburger cart in order to work in the evenings.  These carts are very popular because they fry hamburgers and also make French fries to go with them.\r\nThis is her first loan cycle with the institution in the one year that she has been engaged in this business activity.  It is for these reasons that Ana is requesting a loan to buy a hamburger cart in order to sell hamburgers with French fries in the evenings. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1835328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a hamburger cart in order to sell hamburgers with French fries in the evenings.

Today, Burma's farm contains a horse and 5 sheep. She also grows potatoes and beans for sale on 7.0 hectares of land.

of the Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative (CCT). Marcelo works as a tailor, sewing clothing according to the company or client\u2019s wishes. He uses a sewing machine and other stitching machines, as well as hand-stitching hems and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Marcelo is meeting family expenses without access to savings or credit. Workers can become heavily indebted to money lenders who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason Marcelo is asking for your assistance to help him circumvent loan sharks. He has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem repaying them since the loan payments were automatically deducted from his paycheck. He is seeking a 15,000 PHP loan to start his own business, buying and selling different kinds of merchandise, for additional income.\r\n\r\nMarcelo wants for his children to complete their schooling and have a better future. He looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. \r\n\r\nCCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force and equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\nCCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers such as Marcelo before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and after-work hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1835829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to start a business of buying and selling different kinds of merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-03-19T18:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-18T18:40:08Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.51,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:49:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3881.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187265},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2587.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536294},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2587.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017509},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2587.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313926},{"amount":58.32,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2587.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522649},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:33:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1293.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711432880}],"funded_date":"2015-03-20T17:19:52Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:33:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":855383,"name":"Moses","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moses. who is aged thirty-two is a married man with four children living in Kyenjojo, Uganda.

To get a high quality education, I enrolled at AUCA, department of International and Business Law. I think that is the most prestigious university in Central Asia which has American system of studies. In the future, when I become a highly qualified lawyer, I want to help people in my country. The moral satisfaction from daily work is a highest salary which isn\u2019t measured by monetary units. Being a true lawyer is to be an expert with the high qualified education. AUCA is one of the universities that give good opportunities for studies and even financial aid to all its students. I am not able to cover all my tuition fees; therefore I am applying for a Kiva loan, which will be of much help to me. <br \/><br \/>I am 18 years old and I live with my parents in the south of Kyrgyzstan. My father is a principle of one of the schools in my town and my mother is a teacher at the university there. Despite that fact that they are budgetary workers and earn little, they love their profession and contribute in the future of the youth. From my childhood they used to cultivate in me a good education. They tried to give me the best education and tutored at home. Thanks to them I could study and count at the early childhood. Now my parents are facing hard times and I am asking for a 1 100 USD loan for my higher education tuition fees.

Their town is still rural, but is a great natural escape, and these borrowers use this to sell their products to people visiting their town. \r\n\r\nJuana is a mother of three children and they live together with her and her long-term partner in her simple and rural home structure. Juana is very excited to be receiving her ninth loan from Esperanza International. She has successfully paid off her previous loans and taken steps to grow her business. She started her business almost 12 years ago with a hair dryer that her mother bought for her and after her brother-in-law gave her 300 USD, and she started her beauty salon on her mother's balcony. Now, with Esperanza's loans and her savings, she has a nice beauty salon in her own location. \r\n\r\nShe will invest her new loan in purchasing a hair washer and some hair products. With this investment, she will provide better services to her clients. She will use her earnings to reinvest and to keep growing the business and her improve her family's living conditions, while she saves to have a successful and sustainable business. Juana thanks you for your support!

He lives with his pensioner father, daughter and wife, who gets a 300 GEL fixed salary. She is the only breadwinner in the family, so accordingly, this family finds it hard to cover even basic needs and lives under poverty. \r\n\r\nTo improve the family's living condition somehow, Archil decided to be involved in an agribusiness and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts was unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. \r\n\r\nHis application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 800 GEL for purchasing chickens and setting up a poultry farm. He will place them in the old building in the yard, and after they grow, he will sell them at the local market for a good price. \r\n\r\nBecause of Kiva lenders, Archil will get the chance to generate his own income, do his part for the family's welfare, and live in better conditions. \r\n\r\nHe awaits your support and kindness.

She has a pensioner mother-in-law, a little son and a husband who is a day-worker and gets an insignificant income. \r\n\r\nTo meet the daily costs of her family, Nazibrola got involved in agribusiness. She is engaged with cattle and cow breeding, as well as in the cultivation of agricultural land, where she harvests nuts. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her husband, she sells the products at the local market. However, her income is seasonal and she has a great desire to be involved in another business, along with this activity. \r\n\r\nShe couldn\u2019t receive a loan from the local financial institutions because of their requirement to have a stable income. Then the Start Up program began, which is a joint product of Kiva and Credo. The program allows rural poor like Nazibrola to get a chance to start or re-start a business. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, she will purchase a juice machine and sell juice in front of a local public school. Her customers will be schoolchildren.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the job will be hard for Nazibrola, but she is ready to deal with the difficulties and develop her business gradually. The Start Up credit will be a great support for the family, as they will have daily income, thanks to the Kiva

They are products with a high turnover rate that he must purchase frequently.\r\n\r\nToday he is applying for a Kiva loan, his first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. He will use it to purchase groceries, packaged meals, and beverages; and this will allow him to reduce the frequency of his purchases and obtain discounts for bulk purchasing. \r\n\r\nWith this investment, he will increase his profits, and gradually achieve his dreams of separating his home from his workplace, and continuing to provide a good education for his children.  That will make the Kiva loan a successful investment.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":407.63,"image":{"id":1835600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to purchase groceries, packaged meals, and beverages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-03-20T03:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-19T03:20:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.72,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edinson ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1930000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":137935},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":141728},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":145626},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":149630},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":153745},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":157973},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":162318},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":166781},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":171368},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":176080},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":180923},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":185893}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.08},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.81},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.42},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.31},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.6,"local_amount":137935,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":141347.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649571951},{"amount":55.08,"local_amount":141728,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":145234.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666497311},{"amount":56.59,"local_amount":145626,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":149228.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681350426},{"amount":56.55,"local_amount":149630,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":153331.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.6,"payment_id":696560699},{"amount":57.27,"local_amount":153745,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:47:07Z","rounded_local_amount":157548.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.47,"payment_id":711475443},{"amount":61.32,"local_amount":157973,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:25:05Z","rounded_local_amount":161881.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.07,"payment_id":730994317},{"amount":59.5,"local_amount":162318,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:22:29Z","rounded_local_amount":166333.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.58,"payment_id":752082278}],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T12:46:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanora Brennan","image":null}},{"id":855605,"name":"Rossel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rossel is 38 years old, married and has two children. \r\n\r\nRossel is in the agricultural business, raising pigs in the Philippines.

Gulnor, her husband, children and daughters-in-law live in the Qubadiyon district. She is married. Gulnor is involved in agriculture, just like all of her family members. She has been working in this area for three years. Gulnor requested this loan because this year her family is short of money to buy mineral fertilizers. They already planted potato and wheat crops, but still need to treat the soil with mineral fertilizers  in order to gather an abundant harvest. Gulnor requested a loan herself because MDO Humo has more favorable terms for women clients and create loan products specifically designed for them. Gulnor believes and hopes that, with the help of the loan, she will quickly buy the fertilizers and finish her crop sowing."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":199.19,"image":{"id":1835271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

For about a year, Sadoqat has had a business baking these traditional \u201cSambusa\u201d pasties. She is a Tajik woman who was born in 1980 and knows her traditions and culture well. She is a brave, responsible, hardworking and hospitable person. \r\n\r\nSadoqat is divorced and has two children. She is trying to run a business to keep her family safe. She bakes the \u201cSambusa\u201d with meat, pumpkin and vegetables, and then she sells them at canteens, schools, health centers and places where a lot of people gather. \r\n\r\nShe wants to buy equipment and vegetables for baking \u201cSambusa\u201d, so she is asking for financial support from Kiva lenders to buy vegetables and an oven. \r\n\r\nSadoqat really hopes to be supported.

Therefore she has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

It incurs maintenance charges on a daily basis. Due to insufficient financial means, her husband is unable to do this taxi maintenance, and therefore Kalsoom has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan, Kalsoom's husband can easily afford the maintenance costs. He will then be able to provide better transport facilities and earn more profitable income. Kalsoom also plans to make savings with the profit from her husband's income in order to meet her family's needs in the future.\r\n\r\nKalsoom is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC

He is the third born in a family of six siblings, and has been through secondary schooling but due to circumstances out of his control, he dropped out. He describes his upbringing as challenging. \r\n\r\nJeremiah is hardworking and always says, \u201cI eat from my sweat.\u201d His primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crops. Most of the small holder farmers in his village own approximately half an acre per household and this has made them work extra hard to fully utilize their farms. \r\n\r\nJeremiah has been practicing mixed farming and he enjoys the income he gets, but he has been facing challenges delivering his products to the market. Nyamira town is a very remote area and the roads are in pathetic condition; this has hampered Jeremiah from making timely delivery of products to the market while still fresh. Jeremiah sells vegetables, milk and tomatoes which are very perishable and require quick delivery if you are to fetch a high price. \r\n\r\nJeremiah is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike that will help him deliver his products to the market in a timely way so he can overcome the challenge of facing losses. Through the loan he will deliver the products in a timely manner to the market, and this means he will never suffer losses, which will translate into an immediate increase in profits. \r\n\r\nJeremiah plans to employ someone who will help him on the farm and deliver products to his large client base. Profits from the loan will be used to comfortably repay the loan fully and invest in a solid foundation for his family to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1432.21,"image":{"id":1836274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a motorbike to deliver his products to the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-20T13:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-19T13:40:05Z","loan_amount":3500,"lender_count":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.19,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeremiah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":320000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":13762.6},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":14164.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":14578.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":15004.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":15443.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":15894.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":16359.21},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":16837.31},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":17329.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":17835.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":18357.09},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":18893.57},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":19445.74},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":20014.04},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":20598.95},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":21200.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":21820.55},{"due_date":"2016-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":22458.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.78},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.69},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.9},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.3},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.89},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.66},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":405.06,"local_amount":37033.96,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:34:01Z","rounded_local_amount":37163.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601448},{"amount":427.2,"local_amount":39322.02,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":39460.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.88,"payment_id":681378376},{"amount":583.76,"local_amount":54589.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":54780.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.31,"payment_id":731023185}],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T20:16:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":856028,"name":"Carlos Andres","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Andres est\u00e1 casado con su esposa que se dedica a la crianza de animales menores, Andres tiene 2 hijas, la mayor  de 7 a\u00f1os y la menor de 4 a\u00f1os, mismas que est\u00e1n estudiando, Andres  vive en una casa humilde con su familia, Andres  se dedica a trabajar de alba\u00f1il y a la crianza de animales, con el dinero del cr\u00e9dito Andres  va a comprar chanchos para que su esposa le ayude en el cuidado  de estos animales.
