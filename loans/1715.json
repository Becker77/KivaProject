But for Julius, 37, who is based in the Siongiroi area of Kenya and is a father of a lovely family, he has been practicing mixed farming for the past 8 years. He has managed to earn a decent income. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business that he engages in to make ends meet. He passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about his business, he stated \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d \r\n\r\nJulius sells milk to his neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and he cannot meet the demand. For this reason, he is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that he plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10-20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used to repay the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase his business enterprise. \r\n\r\nJulius is very visionary, and he intends that in the near future, he will start adding value to his milk business through packaging the milk before selling and selling dairy products such as yoghurt. An improved income level will assure his family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, he will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":326.6,"image":{"id":1836310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-20T14:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-19T14:40:04Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.56,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2663.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4494.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4625.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4761.12},{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4900.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5043.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":5190.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":5342.57},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":5498.71},{"due_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":5659.41},{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5824.81},{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5995.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.56},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.04},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.13},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.74},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.86},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.53},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.26,"local_amount":1712.28,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1767.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459963},{"amount":94.47,"local_amount":8453.13,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":8725.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.63,"payment_id":681378377},{"amount":51.51,"local_amount":4640.68,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4790.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.7,"payment_id":696588059},{"amount":48.52,"local_amount":4503.1,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4648.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.14,"payment_id":711506350},{"amount":52.48,"local_amount":4771.17,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4924.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.2,"payment_id":731023186},{"amount":54.8,"local_amount":4950.25,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5109.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.89,"payment_id":752111337}],"funded_date":"2015-04-17T16:42:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":855704,"name":"Zaven","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zaven is constructor.

Because of how much she likes farming, she has even nicknamed her cows Maua and Mrembo, which makes her a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows.

Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques.

He owned multiple businesses and properties in Mexico and was very successful, when he suddenly became ill, and lost everything. He lost all his businesses and properties both in Mexico and the United States. However, being a single father, Gerardo knew he could not give up. \r\n\r\nAll of Gerardo\u2019s family contributed to help him rise again from his crisis; his son went to work, and Gerardo and his family moved in with his brother. Gerardo begin working as a private driver to pay his bills and take care of his family, sometimes working as much as 70 hours a week.\r\n\r\nHe has now relaunched the business named Tendenzy (http:\/\/www.tendenzy.com\/) and is planning to use this loan to launch his website to sell the large amount of inventory he has purchased in an effort to rebrand and restart the business. Gerardo and his family have had to learn to live a very frugal lifestyle, a huge shift from the previously lavish lifestyle they once lived. Gerardo is resilient, and willing to use what he can to start again. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Gerardo hopes to expand his online following and really use the brand he is creating in his packaging.

Meet Ronald, one of the most hardworking men on earth. He is 41 years of age, very hardworking and a go-getter. He is the proud father of four lovely children. He hails from Kegogi, a remote village in the Nyamira area of Kenya. This area has harsh weather conditions, and to survive you must have tough skin, but Ronald has defied all the odds and has been engaged in farming for the past fifteen years. His primary sources of income are maize, poultry, milk and animal farming. Ronald passionately loves farming and has even nicknamed one of his cows. Whenever he is milking his cow, he feels proud. He is content with the farming way of life. His biggest challenge in farming is irrigating his farm. <br \/><br \/>He is requesting a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes that he will use in pumping water from the river to his farm. Irrigation is used to assist in growing agricultural crops, maintaining landscapes, and re-vegetating disturbed soils in dry areas as well as during periods of inadequate rainfall.

The money he earned was used to start a clothing business and also he was loaning people in his community money with interest. The interest and profit he generated from the clothing business and loan business was used to establish the drinks and cement business.  Working 6 days a week and 13 hours a day, he earns about Le 3010000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. James requires a loan in order to buy vegetable oil, crates of assorted hard and soft drinks and packets of liquor drinks.  In the future James plans to provide quality education for his children, reinvest in his business and improve the standard of living of his family.

He is a dairy farmer whose main income source is from the milk he sells in the nearby local market . \n\nLike most businessmen, Wesley's aspiration is to scale his business. For Wesley to grow his business, he needs adequate capital for the expansion. His business being small makes it very hard for him to secure financing from mainstream banks. That is why he is appealing to Kiva lenders to invest in his business in form of a loan. \n\nHe plans to use the loan to buy a dairy cow. An additional dairy cow will provide him with more milk for sale and cushion him from milk shortages during periods when other cows are not on their lactation days.\n\nIncreased income from the investment will place Wesley in a better position to meet his family's basic needs.

Through your loan she will be able to buy good breeds of poultry that have high productivity and high resistance to diseases. Increased productivity will immediately translate to more income and improved living standards. Her crops will benefit from poultry manure, which has a high amount of nitrogen as compared to any other livestock manure. Norah will save more money by not having to buy fertilizer.

Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in the Nandi Hills area. Elizamer has good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market--the demand is very high. Being a visionary woman, she has always wanted to increase her poultry flock, so now she is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry.\r\n\r\nAccessing financial services for women is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising women like Elizamer can achieve their dreams and goals.\r\n\r\nElizamer believes that the key to increased egg production is proper feeding and good care. By ensuring that the poultry are fed well, she is guaranteed to reap the benefits.

for 5 years. She stitches to meet the expenses of her family. However, due to a lack of availability of resources she is unable to provide stitching facilities to more customers.\n\nFor this reason, she requested a loan of 40,000 PKR to Kashf Foundation to buy more spools of threads in different colors with packs of laces, zippers and buttons to create a means of increasing revenues. In this way she will be able to generate a healthier source of income for her family.

She works every day from 7 in the morning until 9 at night, with the aim of succeeding in someday building  the second story of her home, in order to separate the family space from the business space. Her medium-term goal is to succeed in having her children attend university, as today they are 12 and 10 years old.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first from Fundaci\u00f3n

Meet Asha, an ever-smiling young farmer from Litein County in Kenya who has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture. She is a proud owner of a small parcel of land on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. Her primary sources of income are selling eggs and milk, and through this venture, she has earned a decent income. She also engages in personal business in order to make ends meet. Asha passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cow. Although this humble woman has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. Asha is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. Through the loan she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This will help fully satisfy the demand. Through Juhudi Kilimo, which is a field partner, she attended training sessions and was taught the best financial management skills. This will help her save more money to repay the loan fully and to improve her living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":189.23,"image":{"id":1836686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-21T00:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-20T00:00:12Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.88,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.14,"local_amount":2240.15,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:34:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2397.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601463},{"amount":18.76,"local_amount":1607.59,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1720.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459973},{"amount":31.38,"local_amount":2709.75,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2899.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.22,"payment_id":681378393},{"amount":26.39,"local_amount":2292.54,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2453.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.36,"payment_id":696588070},{"amount":27.07,"local_amount":2423.1,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2593.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.2,"payment_id":711506364},{"amount":26.93,"local_amount":2361.5,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2527.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.62,"payment_id":731023195},{"amount":29.68,"local_amount":2585.49,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2766.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.48,"payment_id":752111352}],"funded_date":"2015-03-21T04:05:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Henry Goodman","image":null}},{"id":855958,"name":"Saudah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saudah is married with four children, three of whom go to school.

Meet Sibora, a 46 year-old, very hardworking, honest and ever smiling mother of 4 children. She lives in the Nandihills area of Kenya - an area that is close to the famous Rift valley of Kenya. Sibora passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past 24 years and has always managed to provide for her family. Her primary source of income has been crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets, but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. Sibora has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices in the recent past have been going up, so Sibora, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she knows that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure, and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling her milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also be selling to big dairy processing firms. Sibora said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural based loans and their interest rate is low and is on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Sibora hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children. She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":180.17,"image":{"id":1836735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-21T00:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-20T00:20:06Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.95,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sibora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1769.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1821},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1874.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1929.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1985.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2043.43},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2103.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2164.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2227.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2292.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2359.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2428.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.22},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.13},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.81},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.51},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.96},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.63,"local_amount":3875.03,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:34:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3910.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601467},{"amount":47.16,"local_amount":4317.36,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4356.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.33,"payment_id":681378397},{"amount":42.67,"local_amount":4050.7,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4087.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.89,"payment_id":711506368},{"amount":44.76,"local_amount":4135.25,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4172.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.73,"payment_id":752111355}],"funded_date":"2015-03-21T04:03:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Richard Neuman","image":null}},{"id":848802,"name":"Sevinjh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sevinjh Rasim is a 29-year-old married woman.

is a 36-year-old young woman, from the village, Mamati. She has four little children and a husband who is a private worker in the village and gets insignificant income. The family was exiled and gets persecution pension from the local government. \r\n\r\nAs the income wasn't enough to even cover the basic needs of this large family, Khatuna started a small agribusiness. She seasonally cultivates nuts and mandarin and generates a small income. To satisfy her children's increased needs, Khatuna is eager to start a trading business that will give her a chance to make a more stable income. \r\n\r\nSeveral times, Khatuna requested a loan from local financial institutions for her trading business startup, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because the creditors did not find the existing family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. According to LLC Micro Finance Organization Credo's (Credo) estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKhatuna requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program envisages provisions for business startups and re-startup credits, with soft conditions for the country's rural poor who were regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income and lack of access to credit products. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, she will purchase stocks of food products that she will sell with increased prices from her house. \r\n\r\nThe family's living conditions will significantly improve and the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of need. Katuna will be very grateful for having a chance to make better living conditions for her four children.

Sukanti is one of them who has taken a great role for her development and the group members' livelihood improvement. \r\n\r\nThe middle person standing in the row in the photo is Sukanti. She is about 40 years old and is living with her small family, as she has a husband and only one son. \r\n\r\nSukanti has been engaged with a variety store at her own home in Baramunda village since eight years ago. Through the concerned business she earns a monthly income of 9,000 INR. Her opinion is that the income is not sufficient to maintain her family, with sufficient surplus for a total investment in the business to materialize her dreams. So to get more and more income by expansion of her business, she planned to improve her business in the course of loan. With the loan, she will purchase different varieties of products like bangles, threads, face wash creams, clothes and other items concerning ladies for her store. She hopes to get more and more profit from her business expansion and save money for the construction of a house and to provide a better education to her son.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of her group are also smart at their professions, like vegetable vending, a saree business, a milk business, a Papad business and a breakfast store. With this loan, they hope to boost their livelihoods after disbursement of the loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1836355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase bangles, threads, face wash creams, clothes and items concerning ladies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhubaneswar,Odisha, India","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2015-03-21T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-20T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhunu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sajani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shantilata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sukanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Urbasi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":84000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":84000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-24T16:49:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":856142,"name":"Jose Adalberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jose de 49 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su esposa y sus dos hijos, el se dedica al cultivo de ma\u00edz y maicillo, su esposa le ayuda en las siembras, el tiene m\u00e1s de 20 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a esa  actividad la cual inicio con sus padres desde muy joven, comercializa sus productos en los pueblos aleda\u00f1os y con las ganancias que obtiene logra solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, el esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de insumos agr\u00edcolas como: fertilizantes, semillas, abonos, controles de plagas, herbicidas, etc. y mejorar el terreno y as\u00ed seguir con su trabajo que le genera buenos ingresos econ\u00f3micos.","en":"Jose, 49 years old, lives in his own home with his wife and two children.

small community of Panajxit. Panajxit is one of the many rural communities that surrounds the departmental capital of El Quiche, Santa Cruz el Quiche, in the western highlands of Guatemala. Other than small-scale subsistence farming, the people of Panajxit weave artisanal cortes and hupiles (skirts and blouses) to generate income to supplant the small earnings from agricultural pursuits. \r\n\t \r\n\tCecilia is a thirty-year-old mother of three and the president of the Trust Bank. She has been weaving colorful traditional skirts and blouses since she was 16 years old, almost half her entire life. Currently, Cecilia employs two women who help her weave enough skirts to reach the weekly demand from her clients in Santa Cruz el Quiche. She is reapplying for a loan to buy thread and dyes to maintain her current production of artisan textiles.

Western Highlands of Guatemala. A majority of the people who live there are descendants of the Maya Kachiquel and often only speak that language.\r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMujeres de Maria\u201d, composed of seven women is located here. There are seven ladies in the Trust Bank whose average age is 33 years. The Treasurer of the group is 29-year-old Estercila who is married and has two children. She is very pleased and proud that both of her children attend school in the town. Estercila had the opportunity to attend school until the 8th grade. However, she was not able to complete her studies due to unfortunate circumstances. Currently, Estercila, along with her husband, works hard to improve their standard of living. They want to be certain that their children face a brighter and more prosperous future.  Estercila buys and sells traditional clothing in the center of town. She is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase blouses in different styles, skirts, belts and cloths. This is an especially important time in Guatemala as the Easter holidays are fast approaching and potential customers will want to purchase new clothing. Estercila is hopeful that her loan will be funded by generous KIVA lenders.\r\n\r\nEducation is very important in the lives of Estercila and her friends in the Trust Bank. Each month, a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares practical information with the women in their own language about a variety of subjects that they can apply to their lives immediately. \r\n\r\nKIVA lenders are greatly valued by the \u201cMujeres de Maria\u201d Trust Bank. They will face a happier and more successful future armed with their education and small loans.

So far, she has been in this type of business for five years.\r\n \r\nSor would like to improve her living standards by having clean energy for household use. Because of her lack of capital, she is asking for a loan to build a biogas digester, under the National Biogas Program in partnership with HKL.

For electricity and water, Kadek spends 200,000 IDR per month.\r\n\r\nThe Melati Putih Group has received their new loan. The group expected to get a larger loan, but after they had an evaluation by MUK staff, the group received the same loan amount.\r\n\r\nKadek already has 2 sows and she will use her portion of the loan to purchase super quality feed. She must protect the health of her sows. Kadek is a piglet-seller in her village and also a farmer. She uses the pig\u2019s manure as a fertilizer in her garden. One sow can give birth to 8 \u2013 12 piglets. She hopes the sows can give birth safely and the piglets can grow healthy. She will sell the piglets for fattening or pig barbeque. She has a plan to save all the profit and use it for business capital later.\r\n\r\nOne of the members could not attend the meeting as a member of her family died.
