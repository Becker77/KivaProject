With that, she continues improving more each time on her live conditions.\r\n\r\nAlso, one should note the work of the Foundation of Paraguay which constantly monitors the training and checks in someway the demands, and at the same time encourages the women to fight to be able to overcome poverty.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Antonia is requesting this loan to buy various clothing, like jeans, shirts, t-shirts, and others, so that she can continue working and fighting each day to grow.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":1837093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Through this business, she earns a monthly income of Rs. 6,500. Her opinion is that, though this income is not sufficient to maintain her family, with sufficient surplus and total investment in the business, she will be able to materialize her dreams. <br \/><br \/>So, to get more and more income by expansion of her business, she planned to improve her business in the course of the loan. This resulted in taking the loan to purchase another sewing machine, cloth, more thread, and other related items from the nearest market after the disbursement of the loan. She hopes to get more and more profit from her business expansion, save money for construction of a house, and provide better education to her daughter.<br \/><br \/>The other four members of her group are also smart at their professions: vegetable vending, a milk business, snacks-stall business, and stationery business.

She tells us that she has been a part of Pro Mujer for six years, having joined at the invitation of one of the institution's advisors, as she was in a blocked situation and this kind of work interested her. She now has a business making wool sweatsuits, and says that she started the business several years ago, studying at a technical institution. After gathering capital, she decided to start a business.\r\n\r\nThe loan she will take out now is to increase her capital for buying wool wholesale, which she will get from the sellers in the city of El Alto, and later, after making the sweatsuits, she will sell them in her place of sales.

He and his wife live with her. Bikhosiyat also has three grandchildren. <br \/><br \/>At home, Bikhosiyat has been involved in sewing \"kurpa\" and \"kurpacha\" for more than ten years.

","en":"Carlos is a married man and the father of a 1 year old son. As the proprietor of a general store that sells a variety of products, he needs to increase his liquidity and his volume of sales as these positively impact his profitability. This business supports his family and he wants to offer them greater wellbeing. The idea for his business came out of the need to increase his income in 2012 - a time when he began with little capital but with many dreams to achieve. Little by little, these dreams have inspired him to be successful and to come up with ways to give his son a good upbringing. In the store, Carlos sells for cash and also has customers to whom he offers credit. He buys goods from suppliers in the city of Barranquilla, where he finds the best market prices, so that he can keep up with the competition in this business area. \r\nCarlos works 6 hours a day from Monday through Sunday. His greatest challenge is having enough business capital to buy wholesale. This is why he came to CrediKiva and requested his first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. He will use this loan to buy various goods wholesale and for cash, including clothes, women's accessories, personal hygiene products, cosmetics, etc. He is doing this to fulfill his dream of prosperity, which is to keep growing his business and to successfully use this loan.

Dali is one of them who has taken a great role for her development and their group members' livelihood improvement. \r\n\r\nThe person standing first person from the left, raising her hand in the photo, is Dali. She is about 40 years old and living with her family as she has a husband and three children. \r\n\r\nDali has been engaged on her own with a dairy activity at her own home in IRC village for 20 years. Through this occupation she earns a monthly income of 8,000 INR. Her opinion is that this income is not sufficient to maintain her family, with sufficient surplus for investment in the business so as to materialize her dreams. So to get more income by the expansion of her business, she planned to improve her business in the course of the loan to purchase another two high-breed cows and cow feeding items from the local market, after disbursement of the loan. After completion of the whole process, she hopes to get more and more profit from her business expansion and save money for the construction of a house and to provide better professional education to her children.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of her group are also smart at their businesses like milk business and tailoring occupations, and hope to boost their livelihoods after loan disbursement.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1837147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

Meet Flomena, a youthful 43-year-old mum, and a wise farmer whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in Koibarak, a remote village in Kapsowar. She is happily married and is blessed with an adorable family.\r\n\r\nShe has been practicing mixed farming for the last ten years and has gained significant experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops from her farmland.\r\n\r\nTo make ends meet and to make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Kapsowar area is highly populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is, she says: \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is very high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry.\r\n\r\nBeing a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, Flomena feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will be able to sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level.\r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry market to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she gains will be used in fully repaying the loan, changing her living conditions and securing her family's future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":197.38,"image":{"id":1837299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-21T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-20T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.89,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flomena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.81,"local_amount":2469.37,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:34:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2642.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601473},{"amount":26.38,"local_amount":2261.33,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2420.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459980},{"amount":27.06,"local_amount":2335.35,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2499.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.19,"payment_id":681378404},{"amount":25.53,"local_amount":2218.05,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2373.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.35,"payment_id":696588077},{"amount":26.15,"local_amount":2339.62,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2503.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.15,"payment_id":711506373},{"amount":32.21,"local_amount":2824.06,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3022.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.74,"payment_id":731023204},{"amount":28.35,"local_amount":2469.74,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2643.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.46,"payment_id":752111359}],"funded_date":"2015-03-24T18:38:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie B"}},{"id":857198,"name":"Zhyldyzbu","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0416\u044b\u043b\u0434\u044b\u0437\u0431\u0443 59 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0432\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c 2 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u0416\u044b\u043b\u0434\u044b\u0437\u0431\u0443 -

She has a secondary education.  She works as a cleaning lady, and this activity constitutes her family's main source of income.  She is also involved in animal husbandry; she started in this field 34 years ago when she bought her first livestock for 6,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has one horse, five cows and 25 sheep on her farm.  She receives a pension of about 4,863 som (KGS), and makes a salary of 5,829 som (KGS).

Gulchehra is 27 years old. She is married and a mother.  She is involved in the traditional art of embroidery and she works from home.  She embroiders Tajik decorative items by hand and only works using Tajik techniques.  She embroiders for long periods of time and her work appears very intricate.\r\n\r\nGulchehra is planning to turn one of her rooms at home into a small studio because, at the moment, she doesn't have a particular place to work.  She wants to perform small renovations, reorganize things, and buy some tools.  For all this, she needs money and she has applied for a loan.  She has gathered her savings, but she still needs a small amount of money to achieve her goals.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":560.23,"image":{"id":1838475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to turn one of her rooms into a studio and to buy tools.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursun-zoda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-03-21T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-20T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.21,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulchehra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":390.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":414.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":410.27},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":462},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":461.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":476.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":511.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":524.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":546.45},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":572.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":591.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":639.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.28},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.51},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.35},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.55},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.91},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.82,"local_amount":390.17,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:11:40Z","rounded_local_amount":393.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.09,"payment_id":649621650},{"amount":73.43,"local_amount":414.61,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":417.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.85,"payment_id":665101617},{"amount":72.67,"local_amount":410.27,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":413.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.84,"payment_id":681399726},{"amount":81.55,"local_amount":462,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:26:05Z","rounded_local_amount":465.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.22,"payment_id":696609806},{"amount":80.4,"local_amount":461.95,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":465.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.37,"payment_id":711525830},{"amount":80.69,"local_amount":476.4,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":480.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.66,"payment_id":731041594},{"amount":85.46,"local_amount":511.47,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:06:25Z","rounded_local_amount":515.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.18,"payment_id":752130557}],"funded_date":"2015-03-22T09:06:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":856465,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is 48 years old, married to Evans, and is blessed with five children.

Her business is to sell used shoes. She is a good mother, entrepreneurial, a good listener, with a good attitude, responsible and hard working. She sells on the street in the southern part of the city, which is characterized for its highways connected to the city, with an international airport and a tropical, warm climate, with a temperature which fluctuates between 19-35 degrees Celsius. Claudia is dark complected, with long, loose black hair, dark eyes, medium built, and short stature. Her native tongue is Guarani, which she speaks at home, and she also speaks Spanish as general knowledge and for her business.  (in the picture, she is standing up in the center, she is wearing a rose colored blouse and blue pants.) She shares her life with her children who are studying in school. They own their own house which has running water, electricity, and sewage. Her concern, to be able to have enough income to pay for her children's expenses, drove her to create a group of people with businesses such as jewelry sales, a neighborhood store, linens sales, food sales, cellular phone sales, motorized taxis and a hardware store;  to apply for a loan and improve their activities. Her business is to sell second hand shoes.  Her merchandise comes primarily from the European market. Clean, with slight imperfections and more original designs than the local ones, they come in a variety of qualities (first, second and third quality.) They arrive packaged in sacks of 25, 30, and 40 kgs. and are classified by gender and season (men, women, children, selected by summer and winter.) On the street, with the help of a two wheel cart, she visits the diverse fairs and markets in the city. \"I sell all the merchandise, people look for them and like them because of the price and the materials and designs...) she states. The advantage of this business is the sale of seasonal second hand shoes, the disadvantage is that she has a low inventory. Her dream is to open a shoe store, she wants to buy a lot of shoes of 40 kgs. in order to get a greater quantity and to generate better earnings.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to buy more land to cultivate.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mary\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 5.25 acres of land and purchase a total of nine solar lights.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1793528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-03-22T03:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-21T03:20:04Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph K","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackyline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jafred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geoffrey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Getrude N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":92890,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92890}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T03:18:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":856563,"name":"Analyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Analyn is a 24-year-old married woman and a mother of a four-year-old child, and she is from Ormoc City, Leyte.

With the profits from this coming season, Fred is planning to save more money for the future.\r\n\r\nA total of 7.5 acres will be planted by Fred's Group, and between them they will receive a total of 13 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1793550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, as well as a solar light.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-03-22T05:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-21T05:20:03Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Ambase","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nakitare","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madelide M","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shadrack L","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kelivine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sairus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":128960,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128960}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-19T15:12:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":856606,"name":"Elina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elina is a 48-year-old married woman and a mother of two grown-up children.
