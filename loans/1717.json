His business is the production and sales of stucco.\r\n\r\nHe is a good father, entrepreneurial, dedicated to his work, responsible, and hardworking. He operates his business in the 'Vichaya' community, located west of the Desaguadero River. This area has a variety of materials to be exploded. Work is done with gypsum and stucco, minerals which are exported to support the community. Camelidos are raised in the ranching industry, and the species of alpaca here stands out from other areas due to it high quality. The weather is cold and dry, and the temperature varies during the day between 0 and 12 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nAldo is dark-skinned with short black hair, brown eyes, a short stature, and a thin physical build. His native language is Aymar\u00e1 which he speaks at home, and he also speaks Spanish for general purposes and in his business. He lives his life along with his wife who makes a living in the same business as him, and with his children who study at school. They live in their own home built from adobe with a corrugated iron roof, and they have electricity. To get water, they have to go to a stream 10 minutes away from their home.\r\n\r\nAldo's business is the production and sales of stucco. The production includes the extraction of the rock and the weighing and packaging. The entire process is done manually, and in this area he has hired a helper. The product is sold at wholesale for the construction of homes and buildings. Aldo has his own vehicle to transport the stucco. \"I began in my occupation 7 years ago as an employee. Five years ago, I became independent and now I work independently...\" says Aldo. The advantage of his business is that he has transportation to make deliveries of stucco in any area of the city. The disadvantage is the lack of water in his home. His dream is to explode stucco in greater quantities, and buy a truck to transport it in greater quantities. He would like to buy firewood and fuel in order to explode stucco. This is Aldo's first loan with the institution in the 5 years he has been working independently in this occupation.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Aldo is requesting a loan to buy firewood and fuel in order to explode stucco in greater quantities and to buy a truck.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":910.93,"image":{"id":1837866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

Sasika is 28 years old and is living with her husband and her 4-year-old son. Her husband has been involved in vegetable and paddy farming for a long time. She got the idea of doing vegetable cultivation from her husband, so she gathered Anita and told her about her plan. Anita liked her idea and appreciated her. Sasika took the leadership of the group and started to cultivate vegetables and sell them in her village. She took some land for lease and started vegetable cultivation on a small scale. She started with a limited supply of vegetables like tomatoes and potatoes and grew to sell more than seven varieties like cucumbers, beans, carrots, and radishes. She has developed a very good relationship with her customers in the village as she sells fresh and high-quality vegetables. She likes the fact that she can cater to the needs of the people in her village. \r\n\r\nNow Sasika has a new idea of doing sugarcane cultivation, for which she has requested a loan to utilize for the resources necessary to do sugarcane cultivation.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Bramwel\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 6.25 acres of land and purchase a total of 12 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1793639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-03-22T13:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-21T13:40:04Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bramwel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Temutila N","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily Muronji","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stella M","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":112400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-19T18:34:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":856672,"name":"Jane's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane is 44 years old and has eight children.

She is 52 and lives in the city of Khujand, which is also known as the northern capital. It is an ancient and beautiful city with highly cultured people who have to this day preserved their ancient culture, habits and traditions. Rohat is one of these residents who are helping to preserve this culture. She sews \"kurpas\" and \"kupachas\" at home. These are quilted mattresses, the former used as a type of blanket and the latter as seating. Both are given to brides as part of their trousseau.\r\n\r\nThe warmer part of the year is beginning and along with it the wedding season. Rohat wants to take the opportunity to increase her working capital. She will use the loan amount to purchase fabric, wadding, needles, thread, other sewing accessories and a sewing machine. Since she doesn't have the means to buy these things on her own, she is seeking a loan with the hope that she will not be turned away.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":560.21,"image":{"id":1838525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy wadding, sewing needs and a sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-03-22T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-21T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.23,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rohat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":390.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":399.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":438.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":449.31},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":455.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":486.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":506.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":524.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":549.68},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":565.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":597.7},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":636.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.51},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.7},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.09},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.82,"local_amount":390.17,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":393.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.09,"payment_id":649621652},{"amount":70.69,"local_amount":399.12,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":402.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.82,"payment_id":665101619},{"amount":77.64,"local_amount":438.34,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":441.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.9,"payment_id":681399728},{"amount":79.32,"local_amount":449.31,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:26:05Z","rounded_local_amount":452.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.18,"payment_id":696609808},{"amount":79.35,"local_amount":455.98,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:30:39Z","rounded_local_amount":459.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.35,"payment_id":711525832},{"amount":82.46,"local_amount":486.81,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:07:35Z","rounded_local_amount":490.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.76,"payment_id":731041596},{"amount":84.7,"local_amount":506.97,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:06:25Z","rounded_local_amount":510.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.13,"payment_id":752130558}],"funded_date":"2015-03-28T13:25:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":856688,"name":"Ahmad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmad is a 22-year-old single man from Khan Younis city.

She has two daughters, ages six and three.  Her business is knitted petticoats.  She is a good mother, independent, enterprising, supportive, responsible, and very hard-working.  She conducts her business in the \u2018Senkata\u2019 area.  The area is known for its population, primarily immigrants from the highlands, young people seeking new opportunities, and the cold, dry climate with temperatures that vary between 0 and 12 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n\r\nSonia has a dark complexion, long black, braided hair, and brown eyes.  She is short and thin.  She wears traditional clothing (a brimmed hat, shawl and a traditional skirt). Her first language is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks with her family.  She speaks Spanish with the general public and for her business.  She lives with her life partner, a construction worker, and with her daughters.  The oldest goes to school, and the youngest is not yet school age.  They live in their own house, which is made of brick and cement and has a roof of metal sheeting.  They have running water, electricity, gas for the house, and indoor plumbing.\r\n\r\nHer business is making knitted \u2018enaguas\u2019 [petticoats].  The enagua is a women\u2019s underwear garment that is used over the underwear and under the typical skirts that retain the heat.  \u201cI started my knitting business for my Godmother, who was the one who taught me how to make things,\u201d she says.  The advantage of her business is that she can work in her own house, and she is able to take care of her small children.  The disadvantage is that she does not have fixed customers, and she needs to sell in an itinerant manner.  Her dream is to open an enaguas store. \r\n\r\nShe wishes to refurbish her workshop because water gets in during the rainy season, and it ruins the clothing.  This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the three years that she has been engaged in this business activity independently.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Sonia is requesting a loan to refurbish her workshop so that water does not get in and ruin her merchandise.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1837879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

These are people who have shown they are responsible with their payments, and who know how to manage their businesses. The group is coordinated by Rosa, who is 44 years old. She owns a grocery store and also sells second-hand clothing and cosmetics. Through these businesses she wants to improve her income and help more with household expenses. She began this business three years ago with her life partner's financial support. With the previous loans, she was able to expand her business, what has led her to request another loan for it. With this loan she will buy bales of second-hand clothing, cosmetics and basic grains. The other members are Miriam, 60 years of age, who has sold used clothing in her community for four years; and Pastora, 52 years of age, who owns a mini grocery store and also sells second-hand clothing.

from the Kericho area of Kenya she commands a lot of respect. For the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming, and because of her immense knowledge, farmers flock to her home to seek technical advice on the best techniques.\r\n\r\nAnnah has identified free space on her farm that she wants to fully utilize by keeping a good-quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture, and milk prices have been going up in the recent past. Annah, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this trend. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she knows that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure to boost the fertility of her farm. Selling her milk should never be a problem because there is a ready market, and she will also be selling to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nAnnah said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural loans, and their interest rate is low and is on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro-finance institutions. \r\n\r\nAnnah hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting to offer services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. She hopes that this loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":114.72,"image":{"id":1837707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-22T15:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-21T15:40:09Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.17,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.87,"local_amount":5322.18,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5508.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459984},{"amount":52.68,"local_amount":4875.91,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5046.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.17,"payment_id":711506378}],"funded_date":"2015-03-23T13:53:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joy Adams","image":1247614}},{"id":856729,"name":"Sherbano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sherbano is a married woman and the mother of four children.

She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has of farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to her heart; every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have a better time milking her cow and also feeding. \r\n\r\nA modern dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevents them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Emmy believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

Haja, Yemen. All of Abdullah's children are students and none of them are employed or able to earn money. \r\n\r\nAbullah is the sole provider of the family and works as a teacher in the public sector with a small salary. His salary is not enough to make the necessary expansions to his house. As a result, Abdullah applied for a loan of 400,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase construction materials to expand the house. This loan will help him to build extra rooms in addition to a large bathroom and expand the first one. In reality, his house lacks a suitable bathroom. The house is also without a kitchen and food is made inside a small room where some of his children live. \r\n\r\nAbdullah believes that this loan will improve the living conditions of his family very much. The house needs to a suitable and quiet place, but Abdullah's house is very small and crowded, so most of his children leave the house to read with their friends. Building extra rooms will create a good educational environment for Abdullah's children. Abdullah hopes to renovate all his house after making that necessary expansion.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1837702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

village in the Litein area of Kenya. Today, this humble mother of one child sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has about farming, commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart, and she is proud to wake up every day to milk her cow. \r\n\r\nAlthough she makes profits by selling milk, she lacks a proper dairy unit and is seeking a loan to build one. A good dairy unit provides a place where cows can relax, and also prevents them from coming down with diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather such as rain. \r\n\r\nAlice believes that through this loan, her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save the money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

She is a very dedicated dairy farmer, and she has nicknamed her cow \u201cMutune\u201d (cool cow). Dairy farming is close to her heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow, and that makes her very proud. \r\n\r\nAlthough Elosy makes profits through milk selling, she is faced with the problem of feeding her cow. She is requesting a loan to buy a chaff-cutter. A chaff-cutter is a mechanical device used to cut hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forages. Through the loan, her cows will not reject any part of the food, hence increasing milk production and Elosy's income level. All that Elosy waits for is the lenders' goodwill and kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":205.38,"image":{"id":1837772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a chaff-cutter.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-22T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-21T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.54,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elosy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.86,"local_amount":2473.95,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2655.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601480},{"amount":24.05,"local_amount":2061.48,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2212.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459988},{"amount":32.6,"local_amount":2805.41,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3011.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.13,"payment_id":681378410},{"amount":33.25,"local_amount":2881.93,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3093.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.37,"payment_id":696588084},{"amount":26.49,"local_amount":2364.21,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2537.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.09,"payment_id":711506381},{"amount":28.89,"local_amount":2525.03,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2710.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.57,"payment_id":731023211},{"amount":28.7,"local_amount":2492.39,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2675.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.38,"payment_id":752111367}],"funded_date":"2015-03-24T15:17:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":856874,"name":"Lillian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lillian is a 38-year-old married lady with four children living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

This is his story:\r\n\r\nNana is the chief carver for the king of the Ashanti. \"I draw inspiration from traditional kente cloth designs, from my family background, and from our rich Ashanti tradition. Some of my work for the king includes objects with 'gye nyame' (symbol for the supremacy of God), stools, staffs and other royal and ceremonial objects. My dream has always been to invest in my children's education. I am happy to say that this is now possible.\r\n\r\n\"As a Chief Carver, I can say that it is you who has made it possible for me to look after my children's school now that I am at my old age. So I am very grateful to all the people who are joining in this microcredit to assist me through this loan.

married and has two children. She has received secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, she raises livestock and grows farm crops, having launched this business in 1999 with a starting capital of 1,000 KGS. Thanks to Aisha's hard work, at present she owns a cow; she also grows beans at a land plot of 2.2 ha [5.5 acres]. In order to develop her business further, Aisha has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 50,000 KGS in order to buy mineral fertilizers and niter [saltpeter] to treat her soil and grow environmentally clean beans.

Su sue\u00f1o es construir un establo grande d\u00f3nde entren m\u00e1s cabezas de ganado, el desea realizar la compra de ganado vacuno y lechero para engordarlos y venderlos. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 1 a\u00f1o que desarrolla esta actividad de forma independiente. \nEs por esos motivos que Alvaro solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de ganado vacuno y lechero para engordarlo y cuidar a sus padres.\n","en":"Alvaro is a 21-year-old single man with no children, and his business is buying milk cattle to raise. He is resourceful, independent, patient, responsible, and very hardworking. \r\n\r\nHe runs his business in the Solata community, situated at high altitude adjacent to sacred Lake Titicaca. The community is known for still having its stone buildings. With the passage of time, the residents of this area have learned the most sacred ceremonies in order to live in peace and harmony with everything around them. Having inherited the ability to observe and keep alive the ancestral customs, they take part in ceremonies that are mystical and spiritual.\r\n\r\nAlvaro has dark skin, short black hair, brown eyes, short stature, and a thin build. His native tongue is Aymar\u00e1, which is spoken in the area, and he speaks Spanish because of the general culture and the business that he is in. He shares his life with his parents, who are elderly and don't work. They live in their own house made of adobe with a corrugated metal roof; they have electricity and well water. \r\n\r\nAlvaro's business is the sale of cattle. He is responsible for visiting the markets in the area in search of calves to fatten and sell. This activity takes all his time because his business is constant. \"I inherited this business from my family, as is the local custom. Now my parents don't work and I pay all the expenses,\" he says. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of his business is that he has a lifetime of experience; the disadvantage is the local climate, which does not make for abundant forage. His dream is to build a large stable to hold more head of cattle. He would like to purchase beef and dairy cattle to raise and sell. \r\n\r\nThis is his first lending cycle with the institution in the year that he has been running this business independently. For these reasons, Alvaro is requesting a loan for the purchase of beef and dairy cattle to raise and to take care of his parents."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1837979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase beef and dairy cattle to raise and to take care of his parents","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-22T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-21T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alvaro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-20T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-20T04:00:00Z","amount":292.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T04:00:00Z","amount":275.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T04:00:00Z","amount":296.94},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T04:00:00Z","amount":274.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T04:00:00Z","amount":346.14},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T04:00:00Z","amount":328.14},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T04:00:00Z","amount":335.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T04:00:00Z","amount":371.02},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T04:00:00Z","amount":373.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T04:00:00Z","amount":389.98},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T04:00:00Z","amount":412.36},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T04:00:00Z","amount":415.84},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T04:00:00Z","amount":455.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T04:00:00Z","amount":466.93},{"due_date":"2016-05-20T04:00:00Z","amount":486.78},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T04:00:00Z","amount":505.38},{"due_date":"2016-07-20T04:00:00Z","amount":528.95},{"due_date":"2016-08-22T04:00:00Z","amount":443.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.05},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.7},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.89},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.74},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.37},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.28},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.45},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":113.18,"local_amount":772.94,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:38Z","rounded_local_amount":776.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564561},{"amount":13.76,"local_amount":94,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":94.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046525},{"amount":52.72,"local_amount":360.07,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":361.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344345},{"amount":845.34,"local_amount":5772.99,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5798.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554561}],"funded_date":"2015-04-19T15:55:57Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":857043,"name":"Jocelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jocelyn is a strong-willed woman who pushes her ability when it comes to her piggery business.

He is enterprising, independent, with a good attitude, committed to his work, responsible, and very hardworking. His business developed in the area 'Tilata,' which is characterized by supplying 32 underground water wells in the city. The climate is cold and dry with a temperature that varies between 0-12 degrees Celsius during the day. Santos has a dark complexion, short black hair, brown eyes, short stature, and a medium physique. His mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1 which is spoken in his family, and he speaks Spanish for general culture and carrying out business. His life is shared with his mother who works in trade and his brother who helps in the business. They live in a house owned by their family, constructed of brick and cement with a tin roof. It has potable water, electricity, and a sewage system. His business is making and selling potato chips. The process begins with washing the potatoes to remove dirt, then they are peeled with an industrial peeler machine to cut into thin slices so they remain crispy. Once this process is finished they are fried in an industrial fryer. The whole process is done with his brother. \"I started my business because my family had experience in this business, had clients, and made good sales...\" says Santos. The advantage of his business is keeping a list of regular clients for weekly deliveries, the disadvantage is that he does not have his own vehicle to make deliveries. His dream is to get more customers and make sales to large supermarkets. He wants to renovate his kitchen to be able to produce hygienic (food safe) products of the best quality.

She has four dependent children. To support the family, she works very hard on her own rice farmland by growing and selling the crop to the local dealers and customers in the market. The net profit that she can generate is USD 3.00 a day, on average.

She earns her living selling traditional food. She is a good mother, enterprising, independent, patient, responsible, and hardworking. Her business is located in the neighbourhood of Villa Alegre in the south part of the town. It is an area known for its fine, sandy soil, and its sub-tropical climate with most rain falling in January and February. During the day the temperature varies between 21 and 35 C.\r\n\r\nPaulina is dark skinned and has long black hair which she ties back. Her eyes are dark and she is of short stature. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks at home, but she speaks Spanish for cultural and business purposes. Her husband works as a carpenter\u2019s assistant. Her three older children attend school, but the youngest is not yet of school age. They live in their own house made of bricks and cement with a corrugated sheet roof. They have water, electricity, and a sewage system.\r\n\r\nPaulina makes traditional food from the Santa Cruz area: majadito de charque (dried meat, rice, fried egg and bananas), sopa de remojada (soup made from bones), cogote relleno (stuffed chicken neck), groundnut soup etc. She works two shifts, one to cover the lunch hour and one the supper hour, Monday to Friday.\r\n\r\nShe said that she had other jobs but this is a business with regular daily sales and her customers always finish the food. Her big advantage is that she has a lot of cooking experience; her disadvantage is the number of competitors. Pauline\u2019s dream is to open a big popular restaurant. \r\n\r\nShe now wishes to expand her business by obtaining a loan so she can buy a hamburger cart so she can walk through the streets with it at weekends. This is her first loan with this institution in the four years she has had her food business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1838014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy a hamburger cart so she can walk through the streets with it at weekends","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-22T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-21T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-20T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":368.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T04:00:00Z","amount":329.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T04:00:00Z","amount":343.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":361.51},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":376.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":391.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":408.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":420.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.53},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.68},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.3,"local_amount":368.7,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":379.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214420},{"amount":49.32,"local_amount":328.77,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":338.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564562},{"amount":51.55,"local_amount":343.65,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":353.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046526},{"amount":54.23,"local_amount":361.51,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":371.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344346},{"amount":56.53,"local_amount":376.88,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":387.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554562},{"amount":58.68,"local_amount":391.17,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":402.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468666},{"amount":61.25,"local_amount":408.35,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:13:59Z","rounded_local_amount":420.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296521},{"amount":63.14,"local_amount":420.97,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":433.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076751}],"funded_date":"2015-03-23T06:45:39Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":857020,"name":"Samoeurn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samoeurn, 36, is a married man who lives in a small community of Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia.

She has two children from her marriage: a son who is 27 years old and a daughter who is 25.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, Mavjudakhon decided to start making some money by turning a favorite activity into a business.

Nonetheless, she has always had the strength to overcome them and get ahead with her children. \r\n\r\nTeresia is a smallholder farmer from Kerugoya, in the central region of Kenya. On the farm, she practices mixed farming. She keeps dairy animals and grows maize and vegetables. She has two years of experience in farming. \r\n\r\nTeresia is seeking a loan to expand her horticulture farm. She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output. \r\n\r\nLoans for smallholder farmers with little, irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations like Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Teresia. \r\n\r\nThrough a group of 10 members called Songa Mbele, Teresia has access to loans from Juhudi Kilimo for income-generating assets. These loans use the group-based savings as collateral. According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Teresia, because the institution believes that women, too, are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":351.76,"image":{"id":1838361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to expand her horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-23T00:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-22T00:00:04Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.42,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.68,"local_amount":3879.71,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3926.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601481},{"amount":41.16,"local_amount":3741.99,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3786.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459989},{"amount":42.57,"local_amount":3885.35,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3931.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.17,"payment_id":681378411},{"amount":42.99,"local_amount":3950.04,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3997.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.46,"payment_id":696588085},{"amount":40.73,"local_amount":3855.88,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3902.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.68,"payment_id":711506382},{"amount":42.96,"local_amount":3983.59,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4031.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.86,"payment_id":731023212},{"amount":94.25,"local_amount":8681.61,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:01Z","rounded_local_amount":8785.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.25,"payment_id":752111368}],"funded_date":"2015-03-24T16:10:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":857187,"name":"Asma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asma is a 40-year-old woman.

Therefore he has considered buying a piece of land, but unfortunately does not have sufficient money to undertake this purchase, so he is requesting a loan that he will use to buy a piece of farmland. Domingo dreams of being able to build a cement block house so that he can provide his family with greater comfort.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":466.78,"image":{"id":1838132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy land for growing bananas and coffee.
