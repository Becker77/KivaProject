Her husband has been working in a public sector organization for many years, and he is responsible to fulfill the needs of the family. Zamreen is also providing sewing services and earning income to contribute with her husband to manage the household. \r\n\r\nShe needs different kinds of goods, e.g., needles, threads, pieces of clothes, and machine oil for her business purpose, but due to insufficient financial means she is unable to purchase these accessories. Therefore she has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her to purchase these accessories and also help her to increase her monthly sales and profit by providing better sewing services. Zamreen is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

Therefore Ameer has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her husband to buy all these commodities and help him earn the maximum profitable income to manage their household and business. \r\n\r\nAmeer is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":341.94,"image":{"id":1838450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She lives with her partner and has four children who are 12, 10, 4, and 1. She is enterprising, determined, responsible, very hardworking, and a good mother.\r\n\r\nShe works in the Convipec neighborhood of the '3000 Plan' zone, a place characterized by its immigrant residents: Aymar\u00e1s, Quechuas, and Guaran\u00edes. It is located toward the south of the city, where they settled and initiated a lot of commerce, and it has a warm, tropical climate with day temperature ranges between 18 and 36 degrees Celcius. \r\n\r\nVanessa has a dark complexion, long black hair that she keeps tied up, dark eyes, and medium build. Her first language is Spanish, and she also knows Guarani from her family. (She is standing, second from the left, wearing a black tanktop and white shorts.)\r\n\r\nShe lives her life with her partner, who works in construction, and their four children who help out with the business by carrying the empty and filled boxes. The two older ones are in school, but the younger ones are not yet school age. They live in their own house, which is made of brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof. It has running water, electricity, and plumbing.\r\n\r\nHer dreams of improving her business led her to join a bank of people with jobs such as selling snack foods, selling sports clothes, running a neighborhood store, a butcher shop, a video store, selling food, and gypsum handicrafts, so that she could request a loan and expand her activities. She sells soda for a living and commits to buying ice to refrigerate her soda and keep it cold. Her customers know her and know that her business is the only one of its kind.\r\n\r\nTo continue her business, she wants to open a neighborhood store to earn more income and help cover her children's costs. \"I decided to expand my business, opening a neighborhood store.

She is happily married and together with her husband, they have two children. Yuli owns a stall that sells mobile airtime credits and mobile phone accessories. She joined Ruma almost a year ago and was introduced to Ruma by a Ruma sales executive who came to her stall. She decided to join Ruma because she wanted to expand her business using technology. Yuli is a hardworking woman and her community sees her as a trusted mobile provider. \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Yuli needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits to her community, so her community can stay connected with their loved ones, no matter how far apart they are. Yuli\u2019s goal towards Ruma in the near future, is to serve as an e-commerce business for her community, using Ruma\u2019s latest product called Mapan. As seen in the photo, Yuli is the one who is standing in her stall.

She is married to Felizardo, an OFW, and has two children, one of whom is in High School and the other one in Elementary Level. She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment the family income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs and to send her children to school. \r\n\r\nChona operates a small general store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store that sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 1,000 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan, which she will use to buy grocery items such as rice, canned goods, instant noodles, biscuits, soda and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are her family's source to meet their daily expense and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nChona hopes to maintain and grow her business and to improve their quality of living. She desires to always have a harmonious and happy family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1838492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She decided to save her money to start a business.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she will now take out is to increase her capital (buying meat at whole sale price), which she will obtain from sellers in the city of El Alto and then sell in her shop. This work allows her to generate income to support her family economically. She lives with her partner and has three children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes most about Pro Mujer, she responds that she enjoys the ease of obtaining the loans that the institution offers.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900.09,"image":{"id":1838149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy meat at wholesale price.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2015-03-23T06:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-22T06:00:01Z","loan_amount":4650,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Primitiva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhovana\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mabel Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carola\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":31796,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":4650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2118.97},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2330.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2393.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2459.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2526.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2595.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2738.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2813.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2889.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2968.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3293.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.89},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":359.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":369.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":389.94},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":411.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":422.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":434.12},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":481.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":309.89,"local_amount":2118.97,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-23T12:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2125.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650950408},{"amount":340.88,"local_amount":2330.92,"processed_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2338.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665057810},{"amount":709.78,"local_amount":4853.36,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4869.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681355665},{"amount":369.47,"local_amount":2526.36,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2534.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696565897},{"amount":379.58,"local_amount":2595.52,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:59:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2603.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711481834},{"amount":389.94,"local_amount":2666.36,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731000360},{"amount":400.55,"local_amount":2738.88,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2747.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752088605}],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T14:21:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":857331,"name":"Jeanne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeanne is 30 years old.

We\u2019d like you to meet one of Ruma's agents, Finny. Finny lives in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. She lives there with her husband and her two daughters. \r\n\r\nFinny owns a stall that sells female outfits and mobile airtime credits. As a woman, she realized that it\u2019s really important for her to help her husband increase their income so they can save more money for their children\u2019s education.

is 33 years old and is married. He lives in an Ashkali community and like most there, has always lived under poor conditions. <br \/><br \/>In order to earn a living for his family, Azem had been working by transporting goods for others for a fee.

These members are: Severiana, who sells clothes, shoes, perfumes, garlands, toys, accessories and other items; Miguel and Norma, who make a living selling clothes; Luis, sells soft drinks; Concepci\u00f3n, a seamstress; Ernestina, who works selling costume jewellery; Ana, who sells decorative items; Mar\u00eda, sells perfumes; Mar\u00eda Yaneli, sells cosmetics; and Mar\u00eda del Carmen, who makes a living a selling snacks.\r\n\r\nSeveriana is a mother to one seven-year-old girl, and one 18-year-old man, whom she supports financially. Severiana is best-known as Seve, and she has always worked hard in order to give her family the best that she can by supporting her husband. \r\n\r\nSeveriana received her first loan from VisionFund M\u00e9xico (previously Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad) ten years ago, and used it to buy cellophane, wire, coloured sheets, wax, and other items in order to produce garlands and other products. Later on, Severiana had the opportunity to start another business, this time selling clothes.\r\n\r\nThanks to her hard work and initiative, Seve\u2019s life has changed and she is proud of everything that she has achieved. Today she also sells perfumes, toys and accessories. Each one of Seve\u2019s loans has helped her to keep her businesses stable, buying merchandise or the necessary materials for making products. \r\n\r\nSeve has used her profits to remodel her house, change her furniture and give her children an education. In the future, Seve would like to have her own shop where she can display all of her products. In the meantime, she needs to prepare for the local town festivals that are approaching as it will be a good sales opportunity. Seve wants to buy trousers, skirts, blouses, t-shirts and shirts for her business.\r\n\r\nSeve says, \u201cI am grateful to Lidia Galicia, our loan advisor for some time, who has given us talks on how to make good use of our loans and to invest them in productive activity. Part of our success is because of Lidia.\u201d\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in Severiana\u2019s garden. In it, part of the stove, common to many houses in the region is visible.

Apart from receiving farming inputs, he is also purchasing a solar light as part of his loan, which is very exciting to him as he will now be able to have light during dark hours for his children to be able to study. With the profits that he gains from this year\u2019s harvest, he plans to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nAbraham and his group will receive a total of 13 solar lights, as well as input loans of maize and fertilizer to plant a total of 7.75 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1791565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-03-23T17:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-22T17:40:13Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abraham","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Desmah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wamalwa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":131160,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131160}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-20T21:20:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":857515,"name":"Sarou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A local farmer from Banteay Meanchey province, Sarou is 57 years old.

All of her older children are independent, and the youngest son lives with Ainagul. She has a secondary education and has been involved in animal husbandry and farming for many years. Thanks to her back-breaking labor and capable work, Ainagul achieved significant successes in developing her business and started to earn a monthly profit of 10,000 som (KGS), inclusive of her pension. Today Ainagul's farm contains 3 cows, 20 sheep and also 4.0 hectares of her own land, where she grows beans for sale. Ainagul's earnings are very low and are not enough for a decent life. In order to further develop her business, Ainagul requested a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy 12 sheep. Ainagul plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing the livestock headcount on her farm."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1824159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase 12 sheep in order to invest in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ur-Maral village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-03-23T18:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-22T18:20:06Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ainagul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2016-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2017-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-24T13:46:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":857525,"name":"Touch","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Touch is 55 years old, the mother of three children and lives in Kandal provence.

child. Nasyikat has a secondary education and has very good references from her neighbors. To provide the primary income for her family, she has been involved in animal husbandry since 2010. Her farm contains 6 cows and 100 sheep.

years old, married and raised 2 children. In search of a source of income for her family, Halnisa started her own business in fattening up livestock in 1985 with an initial capital of 50,000 som (KGS) used to buy livestock. She was able to develop her business to  have a monthly profit of up to 15,000 som (KGS). Today, her farm contains 3 cows and 15 sheep.

Currently, since there isn't a room for him to read for his classes, he has to leave the house everyday and spend a lot of time finding a suitable space to study.  \r\n\r\nThis loan will allow Mabkhot to provide his family with better living conditions and make the home more spacious and comfortable."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1838872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Islamic Finance"],"use":"to purchase construction materials to expand his house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Haja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2015-03-23T22:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-22T22:20:06Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mabkhot","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2016-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2016-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2016-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2016-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2017-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2017-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-25T12:14:01Z","rounded_local_amount":12547.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650499763},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-25T12:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":12547.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665378636},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-29T12:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":12547.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681273474},{"amount":1224.98,"local_amount":262500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-21T12:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":263496.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696483398}],"funded_date":"2015-04-21T21:54:24Z","paid_date":"2015-08-21T12:14:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Li","image":null}},{"id":857636,"name":"Ahmad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmad is a 44-year-old father of one son.

Ahora que est\u00e1 a punto de iniciar la \u00e9poca de siembra de ma\u00edz que es la base de la alimentaci\u00f3n durante todo el a\u00f1o, los hombres salen temprano al campo a preparar la tierra.  \nRigoberto es un joven muy trabajador, desde peque\u00f1o sus padres lo motivaron a trabajar el campo y criar animales. Ahora, a sus 25 a\u00f1os de edad y con la dicha de tener a su propia familia, las actividades que aprendi\u00f3 de sus padres le ayudan a ofrecer mejores oportunidades a su esposa y a sus dos peque\u00f1as. \nDurante la semana, Rigoberto trabaja como alba\u00f1il en su propia comunidad, pero en casa tiene becerros, cerdos y borregos que cuida durante algunos meses para despu\u00e9s vender. A pesar de que tiene m\u00e1s a\u00f1os de experiencia, fue hace 10 a\u00f1os que comenz\u00f3 la actividad de manera independiente.  \nTodas las ma\u00f1anas desde muy temprano antes de irse a trabajar Rigoberto prepara la comida y agua para los 20 animales que tiene actualmente. Adem\u00e1s, su esposa tambi\u00e9n lo apoya estando al pendiente.

El apoyo permitir\u00e1 a Rigoberto a mantener a sus animales en las mejores condiciones para obtener m\u00e1s ganancias a la hora de venderlos. \nPensando en el futuro, le gustar\u00eda tener 15 cerdas y dejar de comprar lechones. \u201cSon animales que se reproducen m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido y en una sola camada puedo tener 15 cerditos. Tambi\u00e9n se venden mucho m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido\u201d coment\u00f3 Rigoberto.\n\nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Te\u00f3fila y Laura quienes invertir\u00e1n en su tienda de abarrotes y Leticia en pollos. \n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en las escaleras del quiosco del municipio, cerca tambi\u00e9n se encuentran el palacio de gobierno, una fuente, la plaza y la iglesia cat\u00f3lica.\n","en":"The community where the \"Gorri\u00f3n Dorado\" group is located is very peaceful and its inhabitants are very hard-working. Now that the corn planting season is about to begin, which is the nutritional base for the whole year, the men leave early to the countryside to prepare the land.\r\n\r\nRigoberto is a very hard-working young man. Since he was young, his parents encouraged him to work in the countryside and raise animals. Now, at 25 years old and having his own family, the work he learned from his parents helps him to offer better opportunities to his wife and their two little ones. \r\n\r\nDuring the week, Rigoberto works as a bricklayer in his own community, but at home they have young bulls, pigs and lambs that he cares for during some months to later sell them. Despite having more years of experience, it was 10 years ago that he began this work independently.  Every morning from very early, before leaving to go to work, Rigoberto prepares the food and water for the 20 animals that he currently has.  In addition, his wife also supports him, keeping an eye on them. Rigoberto is fascinated by raising animals and says that he isn't very satisfied by being employed \"with my own business, I am more free and I can make use of more of my time.\"\r\n\r\nCurrently, Rigoberto needs capital to purchase feed for all of his animals. \"I have finished all the fodder and corn that I had accumulated, so I need a loan.\" The support will allow Rigoberto to maintain his animals in the best condition to get more earnings at the time to sell them. \r\n\r\nThinking of the future, he would like to have 15 sows and stop buying suckling pigs. \"They are animals which reproduce faster and in only litter, I can have 15 piglets.

Adriana and Vincente will invest in raising young bulls and Gilberta in her grocery store. \r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken on the stairs of the municipal kiosk, also near where the government palace, the large plaza, and a Catholic church are located."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2052.57,"image":{"id":1825345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 5 sheep.

ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, arboles de algod\u00f3n y sorgo lo que indica que la mayor\u00eda de los habitantes se dedica a trabajar en el campo.\n\nLos integrantes del grupo se dedican a una actividad distinta que les ayuda a ofrecer mejores condiciones de vida a su familia: Mar\u00eda y Lucina se dedican a la venta de dulces; Jos\u00e9 e Irais, a la cr\u00eda de cerdos; Elia, a la venta de muebles; Mar\u00eda Elena y Alicia, a la venta de comida; Maricela, a la venta de ropa y accesorios; V\u00edctor y Rosa, a la venta de mojarra y Santa, a la venta de carne. \n\nEl gusto por los animales de granja es lo que dio pauta a que Irais  iniciara su actividad hace 5 a\u00f1os. Afortunadamente cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo quien le ayud\u00f3 a construir los chiqueros para los animales y a veces le ayuda a ba\u00f1arlos cuando regresa del trabajo. Antes de empezar con los quehaceres del hogar, alimenta a los cerdos. En su tiempo de experiencia, Irais perd\u00edo una cerda justo despu\u00e9s de parir 9 lechones, en aquella ocasi\u00f3n, sus hijos tambi\u00e9n le ayudaron a cuidar de los peque\u00f1os animales aliment\u00e1ndolos con biberones. \n\nEl apoyar a su esposo con los gastos de la casa, la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos y tener un peque\u00f1o ahorro, satisface a Irais quien est\u00e1 orgullosa de ser capaz de ganar su propio dinero y a la vez estar al pendiente de su familia. Tambi\u00e9n agradece que la estabilidad del negocio se debe a los pr\u00e9stamos de VisionFund M\u00e9xico que ha ocupado para comprar alimento especial y suero para los animales, que es justo en lo que invertir\u00e1 el nuevo pr\u00e9stamo. \n\nMirando hacia el futuro, a Irais le gustar\u00eda comprar otra cerda para incrementar el n\u00famero de animales, pero tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda comenzar a vender tacos de carne adecuando un espacio en su casa lo que le permitir\u00e1 incrementar sus ganancias y los beneficios para su familia. \n\nTodas las integrantes del grupo se muestran agradecidas por la oportunidad de recibir los pr\u00e9stamos a pesar de vivir en una comunidad muy alejada ya que les han ayudado a mejorar sus negocios o iniciar otras actividades. \n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el negocio de do\u00f1a Maricela quien adecuado un cuarto en casa como local pare la venta de ropa, Irais viste un su\u00e9ter de color gris.\n","en":"Traveling to the community where the \"Barahunda\" communal bank is located you can appreciate the fields of sugar cane, cotton bushes and sorghum that indicate that the majority of people work the fields. The members of the group have different businesses that offer better living conditions for their families: Mar\u00eda and Lucina work selling sweets; Jos\u00e9 and Irais raise pigs; Elia sells furniture; Mar\u00eda Elena and Alicia sell food; Maricela sells clothing and accessories; V\u00edctor and Rosa sell fish (mojarra) and Santa sells meat. <br \/><br \/>Her love for farm animals gave her the direction for Irene to begin her business 5 years ago. Fortunately she had the support of her husband who helped her build the enclosures for the animals and sometimes helped her clean them when he came home from work. Before starting the housework she feeds the pigs. In her experience over time Irais lost a pig just after it gave birth to 9 piglets. Her children also helped her on this occasion to feed the piglets with milk bottles. She helps her husband with the household expenses, the education of her children and she also has some savings. <br \/><br \/>This satisfies Irais who is proud of being able to earn her own money and at the same time be there to care for her family. She is also grateful to the loans from VisionFund M\u00e9xico for the establishment of the business which she has used to to buy special feed and serum for her animals, which is exactly what she will do with the new loan. <br \/><br \/>Looking to the future Irais wants to buy another pig to increase the number of animals and she would also like to start selling meat tacos adapting a part of her house which would allow her to increase her income and benefit all her family. <br \/><br \/>All the members of the group have demonstrated their gratitude for the opportunity of receiving loans in spite of the fact of living in an isolated community as it has helped them improve their businesses or start new businesses. The photo was taken in Maricela's business where she has adapted a room in her house as a place to sell clothing.

Since she was a girl Diana watched her mother and grandmother making sweets like cocadas (coconut candy), jamoncillo (candy made with milk, sugar and ground pumpkin seeds), dulce de leche and pastries that they went out to sell in the evening or the next morning. <br \/><br \/>The dedication of both women inspired Diana to follow in their foot-steps. \"I like to make sweets which is a business that has been a source of income for many generations in my family\".

El inter\u00e9s por aprender y mantenerse actualizada con cursos tambi\u00e9n es otro atributo que le ha ayudado. \n\nCon las ganancias de la est\u00e9tica, recientemente Arcenia tuvo la oportunidad de abrir una peque\u00f1a tienda donde vende botanas, galletas, dulces y refrescos, principalmente.

At first, she rented a shop in the community center, but she says, \u201cAfter overcoming some obstacles, and thanks to the loans, I have my own shop\u201d.  It is the unconditional support of her husband and children throughout all of this time that has motivated her to overcome the difficulties and continue working. \r\n\r\nDespite having a strong personality, Arcenia recognizes that customer service is essential for the stability of her business, and her interest in learning and keeping herself up to date by taking courses is another attribute that has helped her.\r\n\r\nRecently, Arcenia had the opportunity to open a small store with the earnings from the salon, where she sells mostly snacks, cookies, sweets, and soft drinks.  She has also installed two small video game machines that she charges the neighborhood kids a fee to play. The loans from VisionFund Mexico have provided her with the capital to strengthen both activities.  On this occasion, she needs to invest in materials for her salon, such as scissors, talcum powder, conditioners, razors, coloring, and peroxide.\r\n\r\nNothing makes Arcenia as proud as knowing that thanks to her efforts she was able to give her oldest children an education; and she is still supporting the youngest, who is currently attending high school. It is precisely for him, and to keep demonstrating her support for her husband that she wants to keep working and improving her businesses, and her next objective is to increase the variety of merchandise in her store.\r\n\r\nThe six group members are thankful for the opportunity to receive the financial support that will help them to keep growing their businesses.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken in Luz\u2019s house; the ladies are standing in front of the table where the Cyber Caf\u00e9 computers are placed.

Two years ago, despite having a steady job, she began attending workshops for women entrepreneurs given by the government. In her first class she learned to create embroidered muslin purses, decorated with acrylic paint; in the second, to make fantasy jewelry; and in the third, to bake desserts. On the three occasions, just after finishing the workshops, Teresa began selling the products she was making, offering them to her girlfriends, neighbors, and even to the patients in the clinic. \r\n\r\nHer business has grown, thanks to her effort and dedication, but in the loans from VisionFund Mexico, she has found the economic support for purchasing all the materials and ingredients that she needs most. On this occasion, Teresa wants to re-invest in flour, milk, eggs, and butter for the desserts, as well as muslin, brushes, and crystals for her handicrafts. \r\n\r\nTeresa feels proud and fulfilled by being able to use her knowledge to produce a few more earnings that will ultimately serve to support her husband and her two teenage children.  Teresa\u2019s dream is to be able to open a pastry shop at home, and she will keep saving part of her earnings in order to achieve it.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken at Francisco\u2019s house.

Each one devotes him or herself to an occupation in order to generate  income to provide for their families. Mar\u00eda sells bread and food; Alejandro, sandals and umbrellas; Juana, coffee, bread and tamales; Tomasa, groceries; Aurora, cosmetics and footwear; Grisel, clothing; Ra\u00fal, oranges; and Tirso repairs and sells watches, and offers backyard cleanup services.\r\n\r\nJuana\u2019s family plants and grows coffee, an occupation she only participates in seasonally. It was the pleasure she took in a good cup of coffee accompanied by bread that motivated her to devote herself fully to the sale of bread.  Mornings, she hurries to complete all the household chores, because at 4 P.M. she goes to the bakery to load the loaves into her basket and begin her route throughout the communities. She carries about 150 loaves daily, which sell in only three hours.  Her husband is engaged in the same occupation, but he travels to the villages that are farther away, on his motorcycle.\r\n\r\nThe loans from VisionFund Mexico have helped Juana to improve her occupation; now she no longer travels throughout the communities on foot, but has purchased a tricycle.  She needs the new loan to purchase bags, more bread, and a new basket.

Cada uno de los integrantes desempe\u00f1a una actividad distinta como medio de vida: Graciela, se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de postres y venta de productos naturistas; Inocencia, Teres, Eva, Aurelia y Mar\u00eda, a la venta de calzado por cat\u00e1logo; Petra, a la venta de antojitos; Felipe, a la venta de fruta; Jazm\u00edn, a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos; Emelia, a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos y servicio de sastrer\u00eda; Mirelia, a la venta de comida, perfumes y ropa y Yessenia, a la venta de tacos. \n\nHace 15 a\u00f1os Graciela aprendi\u00f3 a elaborar manjar, arroz con leche, empanadas, risue\u00f1as, donas, pasteles y gelatinas. Su abuelita, quien recuerda que ten\u00eda un saz\u00f3n sensacional, fue quien le ense\u00f1\u00f3 el arte de la reposter\u00eda. Los pasteles los hornea s\u00f3lo por pedido, pero el refrigerador de su casa siempre est\u00e1 repleto de todo tipo de postres, preparada para vender en cualquier momento que alg\u00fan cliente llegue a su casa. Graciela tambi\u00e9n vende de manera ambulante y cada que acude a dejar el pago de su pr\u00e9stamo, por ejemplo, lleva postres en un molde de pl\u00e1stico y regresa a casa con el molde vac\u00edo. Con sus ganancias y ahorros hace un a\u00f1o Graciela tambi\u00e9n comenz\u00f3 a vender productos naturistas. \n\nLa satisfacci\u00f3n de apoyar a su esposo con los gastos de la casa es la mejor motivaci\u00f3n para Graciela y a pesar de que sus hijos le han pedido que deje de vender y se ofrecen ayudarla econ\u00f3micamente, ella sigue con sus actividades. A Graciela le agrada lo que hace y m\u00e1s a\u00fan le hace sentirse \u00fatil. \n\nElla agradece cada uno de los pr\u00e9stamos que ha recibido de VisionFund M\u00e9xico ya que le han permitido comprar refractarios, charolas, domos, una batidora, adem\u00e1s de ingredientes para la elaboraci\u00f3n de los postres. El nuevo pr\u00e9stamo lo invertir\u00e1 en harina, leche, az\u00facar, aceite, durazno, fresa, pi\u00f1a, zanahoria y vasos desechables pues la vacaciones se aproximan y con ellas el incremento de la venta durante el viacrucis del viernes santo en las calles de la comunidad.\n\nA pesar de que sus hijos son mayores, Graciela sigue pensando en ellos. Junto con su esposo ha planeado dedicarse tambi\u00e9n a criar y vender mojarra para dejar un patrimonio a sus hijos. \n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en la calle de la comunidad.

The group was named after its representative, Graciela, who is known as \"Chela\".  Each of the members works in a different business activity: Graciela makes desserts and sells natural products; Inocencia, Teres, Eva, Aurelia and Maria sell shoes by catalogue; Petra sells snack foods; Felipe sells fruit; Jazmin sells cosmetics; Emelia sells cosmetics and has a sewing business; Mirelia sells food and clothing; and Yessenia sells tacos.\r\n\r\nGraciela learned to make foods like rice pudding, turnovers, pastries and gelatins 15 years ago.  She remembers her grandmother fondly as the one who taught her the art of baking.  Cakes are made only on an order basis, but her refrigerator at home is always full of all kinds of desserts that are ready to sell at any given time to any customer.  Graciela also works as a street vendor, and every time she comes to make a payment on her loan she brings in plastic containers with desserts, but returns home with empty containers.  With the profit she earned and part of her savings, Graciela also started to sell natural products.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of helping her husband with the household expenses is Graciela's greatest motivation.  And despite the fact that her children have asked her to retire, as they are willing to help her economically, she continues with her activity.  Graciela enjoys what she does and, even moreso, feeling useful.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful for the loans received through VisionFund Mexico which have allowed her to buy pots and pans, ovens and a mixer, as well as the ingredients to make desserts.  The new loan will be used to buy flour, milk, sugar, oil, peaches, strawberries, pineapple, carrots and disposable cups.  Holiday time is approaching and sales will increase over Good Friday in the streets of the community.\r\n\r\nAlthough her children are now adults, Graciela continues to think about them.  She and her husband are planning to raise and sell \"mojarra\" (crappie fish) to leave assets to their children.\r\n\r\n*The picture was taken on a street in the community.  Graciela is the one holding a plastic container with desserts.  There is one non-member in the picture who is the mother of Maria Guadalupe (who signed the authorization).\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":1836132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy flour, milk, sugar, oil, peaches, strawberries, carrots and cups.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tres Valles, Veracruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-03-23T23:20:36Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-22T23:20:36Z","loan_amount":3200,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Inocencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa Aurora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipe ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jazmin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yessenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":48000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":6046.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769288},{"amount":800,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":12092.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649764047},{"amount":800,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:25:27Z","rounded_local_amount":12092.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597571},{"amount":800,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:20:02Z","rounded_local_amount":12092.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682140962},{"amount":400,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6046.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768105}],"funded_date":"2015-03-24T15:45:57Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T17:55:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":858425,"name":"Los Girasoles Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La comunidad donde se conform\u00f3 el grupo Los Girasoles cuenta con la magn\u00edfica vista de una presa que cubre una gran parte del territorio lo que ha permitido que se formen peque\u00f1as islas a las cuales s\u00f3lo se tiene acceso con lancha particular, chalupa o \u201cpasajeras\u201d como les llaman los habitantes.\n\nLos integrantes del grupo desempe\u00f1an una actividad distinta como medio de vida.

sembrad\u00edos de ca\u00f1a, pl\u00e1tano y ma\u00edz, vendedores de fruta a la orilla de la carretera y de vez en cuando algunas palabras en mazateco que inundan el aire. \n\nLos miembros del grupo desempe\u00f1an distintas actividades como medios de vida para sacar adelante a su familia: Francisca se dedica a la cr\u00eda de marranos, servicio de molino y venta de abarrotes; Alejandra a la venta de lencer\u00eda, cosm\u00e9ticos y carne de pollo; Mayte y Mar\u00eda  a la venta de tamales; Teresa, a la venta de comida y servicio de sastre; Josefina, a la venta de tamales y refrescos;

ropa y calzado por cat\u00e1logo y Jos\u00e9, a la venta de verduras. \n\nDesde hace 14 a\u00f1os, Francisca se dedica a la cr\u00eda y venta de puercos, su actividad principal, pues vio la necesidad de apoyar a su esposo con los gastos de sus dos hijos y de tener un ingreso propio. Pronto, utiliz\u00f3 sus ahorros para comprar un molino y rentarlo a sus vecinos adem\u00e1s de comenzar a vender masa. \n\nNuevamente, Francisca utiliz\u00f3 sus ganancias para emprender otro negocio. Viendo la necesidad de las comunidades m\u00e1s alejadas y de dif\u00edcil acceso, comenz\u00f3 a comprar productos b\u00e1sicos por mayoreo y formar peque\u00f1as despensas para distribuir los fines de semana acompa\u00f1ada de su esposo. \n\nFrancisca necesita comprar m\u00e1s ma\u00edz para sus animales y una marrana con el objetivo de tener m\u00e1s lechones en algunos meses. Ella se siente satisfecha por la actividad que tiene durante todos los d\u00edas de la semana y agradece el apoyo de los pr\u00e9stamos que le han permitido mantener sus negocios, la mercanc\u00eda y animales suficientes. Las ganancias tambi\u00e9n le han ayudado a mejorar sus condiciones de vida: ha renovado los muebles de su hogar y ha podido pagar con mayor facilidad los gastos de educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. \n\nLas ganas de salir adelante contin\u00faan presentes en Francisca y ya piensa en otra actividad, le encantar\u00eda vender antojitos los fines de semana despu\u00e9s de la venta de despensas. \n\n*En la imagen, las integrantes posando en el jard\u00edn de la oficina de VisionFund M\u00e9xico.

Francisca raises pigs, runs a mill and sells groceries; Alejandra sells lingerie, cosmetics and chicken; Mayte and Maria sell tamales; Teresa sells food and has a sewing business; Josefina sells tamales and soft drinks; Mayra sells food; Felipa sells auto spare parts, weaves and sews; Susana sells cosmetics; Yomali sells clothing and shoes by catalogue; and Jose sells vegetables. \r\n\r\nFor 14 years Francisca has been raising and selling pigs, which is her main business.  She felt the need to support her husband to cover the expenses of their two children, and wanted to her own income.  Soon, she used her savings to buy a mill to rent out to neighbors and she started selling dough.\r\n\r\nThen Francisca used her profits to start another business.  Seeing the need of the most remote communities, where access is difficult, she began to buy basic goods, wholesale, and started putting together small packages to distribute on weekends with her husband.\r\n\r\nFrancisca needs to buy more corn for her animals and a sow to have more piglets in a few months.  She is satisfied with the activity she has every day of the week and is grateful to the lenders who have allowed her to keep her business running by having sufficient merchandise and animals.  The profit she has earned has improved her living conditions: she has bought new furniture for her home and been able to pay for her children's education much easier.\r\n\r\nThe desire to get ahead is ever present in Francisca's mind and she is already thinking about a new business.  She would love to sell snack foods on the weekends after delivering the packages.\r\n\r\n*The picture of the members of the group was taken in the garden of the VisionFund Mexico offices.  Francisca is wearing a black top and standing behind Maria who is in a toffee-colored top.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4700,"image":{"id":1835669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy corn and a sow to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Loc.
