Norah has defied all the odds and has been engaged in farming for the past five years. Her primary sources of income are crops and animal farming. Norah passionately loves farming. She is contented with the farming way of life. Norah is a very enterprising woman, and although she never had formal employment, she has always worked hard on her farm and she has always assured her parents of a decent meal. The Nyamira area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why she is seeking a loan to buy seedlings for fruits and vegetables to start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business. \n\nBeing a woman and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Norah feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising women like her.

Meet Lucy, 34 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Michai, a remote village in Kitale. She is happily married and is blessed with adorable children. \r\n\r\nShe has been practicing mixed farming for the last eleven years and has gained a great deal of experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Kitale area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 65,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman seeking to access funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved and that she will be able to buy more poultry. As a result of the loan, she will sell more eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry market to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, permanently change her living conditions, and secure the future of her school-going

Her business involves selling secondhand clothes.  Selmira is a good mother who is enterprising, optimistic, responsible, hardworking, and has a good attitude.  She conducts her business in the town of Sacaba, a rural area that is known for its growth and its business and productive potential.  Located in a semi-tropical valley, Sacaba is where the sale of food is abundant, varied, and is always served with \u201cchicha\u201d (a fermented corn beverage).  The weather is mild throughout the entire year.  In winter, the temperature range varies between 1-24 degrees Celsius.  During the summer, the temperature varies between 10-19 degrees Celsius with strong rains.  <br \/><br \/>Selmira has a dark complexion, long black braided hair, brown eyes, short stature, and a thin physique.  She dresses fashionably.  Her native language is Quechua, which she speaks in her town, but she also speaks Spanish as part of the general culture and to conduct business.  In the photo, she is seated in the middle and wearing a black sweater and holding a light-blue fleece jacket.  Selmira shares her life with her partner, who works for a metalwork company.  They have a son who is a baby.  She and her family live in an adobe house with a metal sheet roof.  Their house has well water, electricity, and sewage services.  Her drive to succeed has resulted in her becoming the leader of a Communal Bank that includes businesspeople who sell perfumes, manage a tire repair shop, provide mobile phone technical services, sell soft drinks, sell traditional skirts, sell ice cream, and make empanadas.  They have joined together so that they can request a loan and improve their business activities.  <br \/><br \/>Selmira sells secondhand clothes such as trousers, turtlenecks, blouses, shirts, T-shirts, and other garments.  She conducts her business as a street vendor by going to different fairs and markets in the city.  Selmira begins her work very early in the morning, which is when she must choose which clothes she will take with her to the place where she will sell for that day.  Her mobile vending post includes a table, an umbrella, and two plastic sheets to cover the clothes.  She carries a mix of clothes and the customers choose what they want from the piles.  The advantage of her business is that she can look after her son while she is working.  The disadvantage is that there is a great deal of competition.  \u201cThere is a lot of competition in my business, but my sales are still good and I have regular customers,\u201d says Selmira.  Her dream is to have a house of her own.  She wants to buy a variety of secondhand clothes to offer and sell in bulk.  This is Selmira\u2019s second loan cycle with Emprender and she has managed an independent business for two years.    <br \/><br \/>For the reasons previously mentioned, Selmira is requesting a loan so that she can buy a variety of secondhand clothes that she can offer and sell in bulk.  As a result, she can provide for her son\u2019s welfare."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4350,"image":{"id":1833812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy a variety of secondhand clothes in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-24T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-23T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":4350,"lender_count":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Selmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhaneth Aleja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Marleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rusber","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines Teresina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-13T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-11T04:00:00Z","amount":3364.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T04:00:00Z","amount":3409.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T04:00:00Z","amount":3533.41},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T04:00:00Z","amount":3662.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T04:00:00Z","amount":3795.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T04:00:00Z","amount":3933.47},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T04:00:00Z","amount":4076.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T04:00:00Z","amount":4224.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.9},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.35},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":530.99},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":570.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":591.12},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":982.25,"local_amount":6774.14,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6787,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564541},{"amount":512.35,"local_amount":3533.41,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3540.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046506},{"amount":530.99,"local_amount":3662.02,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3668.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344326},{"amount":1120.67,"local_amount":7728.8,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":7743.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554544},{"amount":1203.74,"local_amount":8301.63,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":8317.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468650}],"funded_date":"2015-04-20T06:11:27Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":855081,"name":"Vilma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Vilma de 54 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica a la venta de ropa, calzado perfumer\u00eda en diversos barrios de  la ciudad.

For the past eight years, Benard has been earning a decent income from poultry farming. However, the demand is overwhelming and he wants to increase his poultry, but the biggest challenge is lack of funds. He is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. Poultry farming has become one of the most important aspects of agriculture in Kenya because it creates business opportunities for entrepreneurs and it\u2019s a kind of business that can never dry up. Poultry farming is a less strenuous activity that is profitable. Many poultry farmers find a sense of fulfillment having hens all over their homestead. The hens lay eggs that can be consumed or sold. If taken seriously, poultry farming has the potential of being a big business because the demand for poultry products is always high. With your loan, Benard is going to make more income that will enable him to take care of his family's expenses. As times keep getting harder, Benard is doing all he can do to ensure that his family's basic needs are met."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":301.47,"image":{"id":1838953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-24T04:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-23T04:40:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.69,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2477.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2549.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2623.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2700.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2779.57},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2860.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2944.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3030.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3119.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3210.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3303.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3400.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.31},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.53,"local_amount":6171.47,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:34:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6503.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601490},{"amount":60.58,"local_amount":5309.74,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5595.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.1,"payment_id":681378420},{"amount":62.26,"local_amount":5660.37,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5964.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.43,"payment_id":711506392},{"amount":104.41,"local_amount":9237.21,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":9733.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.16,"payment_id":752111377}],"funded_date":"2015-03-24T16:29:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":857696,"name":"Davit","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Davit is 58 years old and married from the village of Doesi.

She is married and has two children, aged 9 and 6 years; both are school-going children. She has one additional dependent who lives with her to be fostered.  \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Kadiatu Umarr established her textiles business. She began her business because she dropped out at primary level due to the death of her father. Her mother was not financially strong enough to pay for her school, so she therefore joined her mother in business and later got married. Her husband gave her some amount of money to start her own business, and she has now established it to the present business.  \r\n\r\nWorking six days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 1,751,000 SLL every month from this business.

With the loan from Kiva, she would like to pay workers who harvested maize. The profits from the business will be used to pay school fees of her children and to improve their welfare.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

In this area, most of the peoples are in the poorer community. A person in their community has a particularly small business occupation only. Undoubtedly, they all belong to small businesses but their ambition is higher than their current status. The income they get from this is only hand-to-mouth for them. Mrs. Narmada, about 33, is a woman from this area. She is standing first from the right hand side with her hand raised in the photo. She is married and lives with her husband and only son who is three years old. \r\n\r\nMrs. Narmada is engaged in a small business. She earns a monthly income of Rs. 8,000 INR from this business. According to Narmada, this small income is not at all sufficient to meet the requirements of her family as well as her social livelihood. Due to this situation, she was in search of a credit source and Mahashakti introduced its work in the same area. Narmada, along with four other members, formed a group named Rasmita. So she wants with this loan to purchase more and more quantities of sugar, wheat, dal, spice items, biscuit items and other grocery shop requisite items for the expansion of the business.

His business is located in Vichaya province, which is characterized by having an Aymar\u00e1 demographic. In these lands of the \"Eagle men,\" many treasures stand out such as a Franciscan temple, build in 1560 and declared a National Monument, which has a stockpile of important canvases of paintings from the 18th century, and more.

He shares his life with his partner who works making stucco and with their child who is a baby. They live in their own family house made of adobe with a metal sheeting roof and which has electricity. To get water, they go to a stream that is about 10 minutes away by walking. His business is making stucco, which is a paste of fine grains made up of lime powder, pulverized marble, and natural colors, which hardens through a chemical reaction when the calcium carbonate of the lime is in contact with carbon dioxide, and is used mostly to whiten walls and roofs. His work consists of breaking up the rock itself all the way to making the final product, work that he does every day of the week during the daytime. \"I began this work by inheritance from my father who also works in the same business...\" he says. The advantage of his business is that he works with his partner. The disadvantage is that the stream is far away. His dream is to have his own land where he can get the rocks. He wants to purchase clay and manure to produce stucco.

She lives there with her husband and her only child. \r\n\r\nNur owns a stall that sells mobile airtime credits. As a woman, she realized that it\u2019s really important for her to help her husband increase their income, so they can save more money for their child\u2019s education. That\u2019s why she decided to join Ruma. \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Nur needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits to her community, so her community can stay connected with their loved ones, no matter how far they are apart. \r\n\r\nNur\u2019s goal with Ruma in the nearly future is to serve as an e-commerce business for her community, with Ruma\u2019s latest product called 'Mapan'. \r\n\r\nAs seen in the photo, Nur is the one who is standing behind her own stall.

His fatherly love has been enough to show him that he needs to work hard to help his children get ahead with excellent values and education. George is a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who hails from Kerugoya, a rural town in Kenya. He is a family man, and he has a lovely family that he really loves and cherishes. Gilbert and his wife work as a team supporting each other, and have practiced mixed farming for the past five years. \r\n\r\nGilbert always says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming, and it runs in my blood.\u201d Because of the liking that he has for farming, he has even nicknamed one of his cows, which makes him a very proud farmer, especially when he is milking his cows. Through his dairy cow, he is able to get between 5-10 liters of milk a day, and this helps him support his family. \r\n\r\nGilbert practices crop farming, but he has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements; that is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, he will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that he will use to greatly improve his crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure him a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. \r\n\r\nGilbert is very visionary, and his goal for the season is to boost his crop production and be able to get more crop output than last year.

We\u2019d like you to meet one of PT Rekan Usaha Mikro Anda's (Ruma) agents, Kiki. Kiki lives in East Serang, a suburban area located about two hours' drive from Jakarta, the capital city. She lives there with her husband and her two children. \r\n\r\nKiki owns a stall where she sells daily consumer products and mobile airtime credits. As a woman, she realized that it\u2019s really important for her to help her husband increase their income, so they can save more money for their children\u2019s education.

One of them has a beauty salon, another a soda fountain, and the third one has a small bazaar. They have great desire to continue with their productive activities because they are head of household who support their homes. They demonstrated an excellent payment history in their last credit. They are all Nicaraguan, with many years  of residence in Costa Rica. One of the members, Mrs. Sandra, is married with two daughters and a son, who are studying and they show a good academic record. Mrs. Sandra has taught her children the importance and the good habit of studying to achieve a better future. She has a beauty salon in the community where she lives, one of the few, and has been able to get different certifications in this area. She cuts hair, does hairstyling, nail polish, hair coloring and other treatments for personal care. Her daughter helps her in the afternoons, and she wants to learn like Mrs. Sandra because she has set a good example for the good service she provides. She needs a loan to buy a better washbasin for hair and products to be able to service her clients more efficiently. The washbasin she currently has is on the verge of falling apart. She chose Fundacion Mujer for the low interest rate and fast service they provide. Mrs. Sandra dreams of remodeling her salon, move to a larger location, and be able to buy new equipment to service a larger number of people and convert her salon into the most modern and favorite of people. This is possible if she is helped with this loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1835407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy merchandise and washbasin for hair.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"San Jos\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2015-03-24T18:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-23T18:20:16Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estebana Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":120393.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":122199.82},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":124032.82},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125893.31},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":127781.71},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":129698.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":225.4,"local_amount":120750,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-20T12:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":120823.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666210363},{"amount":228.78,"local_amount":122561.25,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":122635.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681351461},{"amount":232.21,"local_amount":124399.67,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:59:11Z","rounded_local_amount":124475.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696781550},{"amount":235.7,"local_amount":126265.66,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-24T12:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":126342.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":713908380},{"amount":239.23,"local_amount":128159.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-19T12:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":128237.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731625110},{"amount":238.68,"local_amount":127863.77,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-08T13:10:16Z","rounded_local_amount":127941.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752084093}],"funded_date":"2015-03-25T03:51:06Z","paid_date":"2015-12-08T13:10:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Virginia Contreras Smith","image":1715363}},{"id":855141,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":556.86,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase machinery and products to sell.

Poultry farming is economical and feasible since it doesn\u2019t require much land space. Francis is projecting returns that are sustainable over a long period of time. With the success of the first phase of his plan, he will secure a second loan to purchase more chickens to increase his sales volume. Francis takes pride in belonging to his tribe. People from the Nyanza region are well known to like chicken products, especially meat. Many homesteads keep poultry for subsistence. With the extra income from poultry farming, Francis will comfortably meet the high farming expenses that cripple small-scale farmers across the country.

The above picture presents to you Lilian, a very hardworking mother and ambitious go-getter who is 29 years of age and hails from the Chuka area of Kenya, a rural town on the slopes of the famous Mount Kenya. Together with her handsome husband, they support each other as a team and have been doing mixed farming for the past 20 years. Through all those years, she has been able to take care of her family and pay school fees for her children. \r\n\r\nAlthough this humble mum has been making profits, not everything has been \u201ca bed of roses.\" She has been facing financial challenges and, because the Chuka area has a ready market for cereals, she is seeking a loan to buy cereals to be able to improve her income level. Lilian\u2019s upbringing was challenging and she has been facing many economic problems, but this ever-smiling mum has been making great improvements.

The residents works planting, cleaning, shucking and shelling corn.  They use part of the harvest for their own consumption, and the rest is sold.\r\n\r\n\"El Llanito\" is a group made up of very responsible men and women.  Among them are elderly individuals, but that does not impede their ability to work in their businesses.  The name of the group makes reference to the area where the group's representative lives and where they meet to make their payments, a little flat area. \"Everyday you could see animals grazing and women watching their children as they played soccer\" says the groups leader.  The members and their jobs are: Mar\u00eda, selling chickens; Modesta, restaurant; Celia, raising and selling cows; Jos\u00e9, Sandra, Berenice, Margarita, selling sheep; and Martha, selling pigs.\r\n\r\nSandra is the youngest.  She is 24 years old and is married to Giovani who works in construction.  Currently, they do not have children but they hope to start saving and find stability so that she can offer their future children a better quality of life. A year ago, Sandra received her first loan through VisionFund Mexico, and started raising and selling sheep. She started with nothing but the loan allowed her to purchase animals.  Today, she only has four sheep but she hopes to purchase more with this new loan.  The coyotes in the region are the biggest challenge for Sandra as they can cause her to easily lose her animals.
