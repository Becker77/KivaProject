Their businesses include commerce in various goods with the sale of Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), firewood, and soaps.

En consecuencia, junto a su pareja han conseguido que sus cultivos le sean muy rentables y con esas ganancias educaron a su hija en Lima (ciudad capital), pagando tambi\u00e9n su estad\u00eda y alimentaci\u00f3n mientras estudiaba. Irene comercializa sus productos en el mercado de mayoristas de la ciudad, donde todos los mi\u00e9rcoles por la tarde (en \u00e9poca de cosecha), vende las papas m\u00e1s grandes entre 30 y 50 soles el saco; las medianas, las guarda en su dep\u00f3sito, esperando que los otros compradores de la zona coste\u00f1a la visiten. A Irene le gusta sembrar este tub\u00e9rculo porque aunque sea de mucha inversi\u00f3n, siempre recupera y gana, cuyos ahorros viene reuniendo para comprar otros terrenos de su cultivo. \nEste es su quinto pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, por lo que se compromete y aconseja a sus compa\u00f1eros de grupo a seguir pagando puntualmente sus cuotas, siendo ella la tesorera de su banco comunal. El dinero que viene solicitando lo piensa invertir en la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos y funguicidas para su pr\u00f3xima siembra de papas.","en":"Irene is 47 years old, she is an industrious woman and lives with her husband.  Her only daughter lives and works in another city. Irene works planting potatoes in her own farm and due to the experience gained over the years, she has mastered the necessary agricultural techniques. Consequently, working together with her spouse, they have managed to have profitable crops and have used their earnings to pay for their daughter\u2019s education in Lima (capital city), including room and board. Irene sells her products in the city\u2019s wholesale market, where every Wednesday afternoon (during the crop season) she sells the biggest potatoes for about 30 to 50 soles per sack; she keeps the medium-sized potatoes, hoping to sell them to other buyers visiting from coastal areas. Irene likes to plant this tuber because in spite of the high investment required, she always recoups it and makes a profit; she has been saving to buy more potato fields. This is her fifth loan with MFP, encouraging a personal commitment and advising her fellow group members to continue making payments on time, since she is also the treasurer of the community bank. She is thinking of investing her loan in buying chemical fertilizers and fungicides for her next potato crop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carlos Morales, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":392167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buying fertilizers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-22T04:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3034.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717288}],"funded_date":"2009-09-22T10:46:31Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carlos Morales","image":263787}},{"id":142668,"name":"Shola","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shola is 40 years old and she is married with 4 children.She sells detergent in retail to her customers in Lagos state, Nigeria.

They have one child who is currently going to school and also helps out with the business as part of their daily chores. Their other six children are already working.\n\nRosemarie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1992 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income with her rice business. Now she earns an average monthly income of 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) from her business activities.\n\nRosemarie is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of 29,500 PHP was used to fund the operations of her rice business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 16th loan, in the amount of 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use on her farming activities. Rosemarie is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\n\nRosemarie is shown in the accompanying photo with her stockpile of rice grains that she sells.\n\nAbout NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable).

He lives with his wife Eugenia, also 47, and their two beloved children, to whom he wants to give a better quality of life. When he was a boy, Carlos' parents taught him everything he needed to know about farming. Over time he took charge of more and more of his parents' land. Now he has a large area under cultivation, where he grows cofee and bananas to sell in the market in the city of La Merced. What he likes most about his work is cultivating the land where he grows food for his family. It has taken him 12 years to get to where he is today. What he considers most difficult is protecting his crops from the insect pests that reduce his harvest. One day he would like to buy himself a car so that he can transport his produce. this is the third loan Carlos has had from MFP. He has always been very punctual with his repayments and hopes to remain so. He is trusted as a member of his communal bank.

They live in a fishing area in the Lambayeque province that is located 20 minutes outside the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe has worked for six years preparing and selling wholesale papas rellenas [stuffed potatoes] and tortas de choclo [a sweet corn cake] which are typical dishes in this area that are generally served as appetizers.  She prepares these products in her home and then distributes them to restaurants and food stands in her area.  Additionally, she works selling beer out of her home.  Her husband is a fisherman and with both of their incomes they are able to support their family.\r\n\r\nCarmen Rosa would like to purchase more supplies to expand her production and increase her profits. She would also like to acquire more beer to expand her sales business.  In order to achieve her goal, she has found it convenient to request her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 2000 soles.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a very responsible woman and very devoted to her family.  Her greatest desire is to see her family make progress and enjoy a greater quality of life.  Everyone who knows her considers her to be someone who is very friendly and who can be counted on.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":615663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of supplies to expand her business producing and selling appetizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Jos\u00e9 -

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M. is 36 years old and lives with his common-law wife in his home in the Ocucaje district, along with a son who is 2 years old and a daughter who is school-aged.  He has worked as a taxi driver on routes from Ica to La Venta or Ocucaje for about 8 years for the transport company Virgen del Carmen in the city of Ica.  The vehicle he has belongs to his brother, who is a policeman and lives in the center of the city.  His wife does seasonal work in agriculture; she is currently not working since she must care for her small son.  Edilberto is not indebted to any financial institution.

Despite the amount of walking and the collections she must do to find clients (who are usually her family and neighbors), she enjoys her work very much, since it\u2019s nice and comfortable to do it during the extra time she has available, because she also has to care for her grandchild since her daughter is working.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

El arduo trabajo que Justina realiza en su chacra, ha hecho que sus cultivos sean muy productivos y abundantes. Sus productos los lleva a vender a la ciudad de San Francisco, donde obtiene buenos precios por sus plantas de cacao, caf\u00e9 y frutas c\u00edtricas, ya que tiene clientes muy fieles, quienes le compran todo al por mayor. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cuidar sus sembr\u00edos de la plaga de insectos que pueden afectar sus plantaciones. Lleva 35 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus productos, porque que el transporte de veh\u00edculos es muy escaso por esta parte de la ciudad y por ello solicita el cr\u00e9dito para poder comprar triciclos y carretillas para trasladar sus productos.

Justina has worked very hard on her farm and therefore her crops have been abundant and productive.  She takes them to sell in San Francisco where she gets the best prices for her cacao plants, coffee and citrus fruit since she has loyal customers who buy all wholesale.  What she most likes about her work is protecting her plantings from the insect infestations that can affect the crops.  \r\nShe has been farming for 35 years and what she considers the most difficult is transporting the products because transport vehicles are few and far between in this part of the city. That is why she is requesting a loan so that she can buy cargo tricycles and carts so that she can move the products.  She plans on working with the same effort in the future since she wants her children to become professionals.\r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with MFP and she made her previous payments punctually so as to pay off the loans.  She hopes that you will help so that she may continue progressing and she thanks the lenders for supporting her in her work.  She will use the 1,000 new sols to buy carts and cargo tricycles so that she can transport her harvest.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":871053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy carts and cargo tricycles to transport her harvested crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-18T21:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":84.41},{"due_date":"2011-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":88.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":90.73},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":94.91},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":96.73},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":101.69},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":105.81},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":108.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":113.1},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":115.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.65},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.23},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.02},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.59},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.27},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.14},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.68},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.57},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.65,"local_amount":84.41,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:34Z","rounded_local_amount":86.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851343},{"amount":33.23,"local_amount":88.59,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":90.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666533},{"amount":34.02,"local_amount":90.73,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":92.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621682},{"amount":35.59,"local_amount":94.91,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":97.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835764},{"amount":36.27,"local_amount":96.73,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:55Z","rounded_local_amount":99.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245523},{"amount":38.14,"local_amount":101.69,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:29Z","rounded_local_amount":104.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385575},{"amount":39.68,"local_amount":105.81,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":108.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098645},{"amount":40.57,"local_amount":108.2,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:30Z","rounded_local_amount":110.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712870},{"amount":42.41,"local_amount":113.1,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-17T08:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":115.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201973},{"amount":43.44,"local_amount":115.83,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":118.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097763}],"funded_date":"2011-09-19T22:10:05Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:48:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":340175,"name":"Alex","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alex lives in Kampala, Uganda.

She was scared to go into business alone, \u201cBut then I realized: Times are changing and now women do have the opportunity to run their own businesses. I knew it would be hard but I knew I could do it,\u201d recalls Diana. \r\n\r\nAnd Diana did not have to go it alone. Propelled by the help of Women\u2019s Initiative (a San Francisco-based training center for women entrepreneurs) and MISBA (a network of small businesses in the Mission neighborhood), she launched a small jewelry and repair shop in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District neighborhood. Diana affectionately named it \u201cDiju,\u201d after a combination of her name and her husband\u2019s name, Juan. Diana\u2019s friends and family gathered together and helped furnish her shop. Together they built countertops and cabinets out of beautiful, dark wood and filled the cabinets with delicate silver and beaded necklaces, rings and earrings. \u201cI feel so grateful to have had so much help and support. I was never alone in this,\u201d she beamed. \r\n\r\nDiju Jewelry gained recognition in the community and business flourished. \u201cI feel so proud to own my own successful business outside of my home country.\u201d By 2010, Diana\u2019s business had grown to the point that she needed to purchase more merchandise. She knew she could increase her profits if she had more merchandise to sell, but she didn\u2019t have the money to purchase the inventory up front\u2014a plight common to many small businesses.\r\n\r\nA loan officer from Opportunity Fund was venturing through the Mission, catching up with local shopkeepers and getting to know new local business owners. When she passed through Diju Jewelry, Diana explained her business\u2019s needs and together they came to the conclusion that a microloan would do just the trick.  \u201cOpportunity Fund made everything so easy. Anytime I was confused or had a question, I just asked my loan officer and she helped me so much,\u201d said Diana. \r\n\r\nDiana repaid her first loan in no time and raised her FICO score from 633 to 654! When she applied for a second loan this fall, Opportunity Fund was delighted to continue building a relationship with her and approved her for another loan. With $5,000, Diana will buy a new security system and increase her inventory. \r\n\r\nThe future of Diju Jewelry is bright. Diana hopes to attend an artisanal school and expand her expertise about jewelry design and repair.

She has worked in agriculture since she was very young, growing bananas and citrus fruits on a few hectares of land which she farms in rotation. When she harvests the fruit, she stores it in her house, packages it, and sends it to market in the city. She also grows coffee, which is seasonally very profitable. Bananas, on the other hand, are always inexpensive but never fail to provide good income.

The members of this group live at the entrance of Piedra Menuda, an area of Nindir\u00ed, which allows them to have greater accessibility to move from their buying and selling locations.\r\n\r\nThe group leader is the young Yuly Hern\u00e1ndez W., who is 19 years old and has very low economic resources, but because of her dreams of continuing her education and being able to attend university, she decided to open a business with her father. As a result, she started selling clothes, which she distributes within her community and at the university. In the near future, she wants to have her own store.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, this young woman needs to reinvest to buy clothing for adults, because in her business, she needs to have many new lines of fashion in shirts, blouses, pants, stocking, and underwear.\r\n\r\nOne of the other members is the young Martha Isabel S. S\u00e1nchez, who is 24 years old, is married to Dar\u00edo Garc\u00eda, and has a small business selling clothes.

Shaiym lives in a rural town. Together with her husband, she has raised four children. Her husband is engaged in trading at the market. As for the children, the elder sons, who are 34 and 29, make their living by working as taxi drivers. A daughter, 26, is a seamstress. The youngest son, 22, is a welder. \r\n\r\nAbout 10 years ago, Shaiym got an idea to start raising cattle. She consulted with her husband and children and they decided to give this idea a try and purchased some sheep and a cow. After a short period of time, they understood that this was an excellent business as it was profitable and economical. Since that time, Shaiym has received a lot of profit as she has been selling milk daily and selling sheep when needed. \r\n\r\nHaving these children, Shaiym is already a happy mother and could easily spare herself from any kind of concerns or problems. However, she has been the one who has brought these children up to be hardworking young people. Now Shaiym is 56 years old. She is actively occupied with increasing the total population of her cattle and sells 15 liters of milk per day. This brings her around $105 per month. Moreover, all her children strive to help their mother after work to take care of cattle. Shaiym does not have any difficulties dealing with her livestock. Shaiym needs a loan to buy one more cow. \r\n\r\nShaiym\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nAsel, 22, is married. Her husband is a welder. Asel raises livestock and sells milk. She needs this loan to buy two or three sheep.\r\n\r\nAigul, 40, has three children. Her husband works at a construction site. Aigul tailors woolen shoes and sells them at a fair. Aigul hopes to buy some sheep with this loan.\r\n\r\nRapat, 30, is the wife of a taxi driver. Rapat works as a seamstress. She has applied for this loan to buy one calf. \r\n\r\nShaiym and her partners have some savings to add to the loans to be able to make their purchases.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious, socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept: People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

This also encouraged her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in the year 2002 in order to have start-up capital for her proposed business.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the capital to invest in a general store, she bought different items to sell.  Loans continued, and she was able to add a food-vending business and a pig-fattening business.  She knows that this can help her earn money and realize her dreams. She was able to earn a minimum of $43 a month and saved most of it for her children.\r\n<p>\r\nHer previous loan of 17,000 PHP was used as working capital for her business. That amount was returned to NWTF-PD in full and on-time without any delay. She is currently on her 13th cycle loan, requesting 19,000 PHP, which will be used to buy additional items to sell in her general store.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of the community who has earned respect through  a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":434652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He is married and has a one year-old child and has only been a member of the Yoff credit association since February 2010. Mr V. has sold rosaries for a living since 1999; but in 2009 he accompanied this activity by becoming a caretaker at a local school. His holy teacher suggested he choose this business activity once he had finished his rosary-making apprenticeship. He is seeking a 50 000 FRS loan to purchase different colour thread and beads in order to enlarge his inventory of rosaries and widen the choice for his customers. His aim is to increase his profits in order to help his father and brother to meet everyday costs and to help with his family's health and nutritional needs. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":531530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"boost stock levels","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-04-27T21:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"El Hadj ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":8333,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":10216.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790924},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":8333,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":10216.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971359},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":8333.99,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":10217.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708643},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":8333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-24T08:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":10216.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922676},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":8333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-02T11:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":10216.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189191},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":8333.35,"processed_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-23T12:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":10216.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484615}],"funded_date":"2010-04-28T00:06:53Z","paid_date":"2010-11-23T12:00:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Danielle Treharne","image":null}},{"id":200849,"name":"Blanca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa Sra.

She is married and has a daughter. For more than 20 years, Saodat has had her own business. She embroiders the national skull-cap for men and women. Saodat produces various types of the national skull-cap, so she has many clients and usually there are many orders. Her daughter helps her with the business. \r\n\r\nSaodat sells the skull-caps to her own customers, who are always in expectation of the new goods. Thus her business is stable, allowing Saodat to contribute significant income into the family budget. \r\n\r\nToday, Saodat requests 7500 Somoni. The loan is required for purchasing the fabrics for embroidering the national skull-cap. Saodat thanks all supporting her and promises to pay the loan on time.     \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a being key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At times she relies on the economic assistance of some of her children, but this is a small help, because the home where she lives is rented and the rent is very high, and her youngest child is still in school.

The loan that she requests will be invested in the purchase of firewood, corn, limes and corn flour.  The loans that she has received have helped her a lot because she has been able to provide for her family.

children. \nJulia has always been a storekeeper and makes her living through sales. She decided to start a convenience shop in her house that was successful for many years. Unfortunately, she had to close it because her mother got sick and she had to care for her. Her mother is 91 years-old and needs a lot of attention, and because Julia is the only single sibling she has the responsibility of caring for her.

C., 28, has had her grocery store for two years now.  She stocks food and basic needs items in a space in her home, located in Lourdes Col\u00f3n, La Libertad department.  She lives there with her family, which is made up of her husband and two children, 9 and 4 years old, who are enrolled in the local elementary school.  Carlota requests funds hoping to help her business grow.  She will buy items like:  bread, eggs, basic grains, larger amounts of soft-drinks (which are her best sellers).  A grocery store is a very profitable business and she always makes good profits, as long as she is well stocked.  She hopes, therefore, to be able to buy all the necessary merchandise that will allow her to increase her sales.  Carlota has always dreamt of providing for her children a better life than the one she had; sufficient reason to work very hard every day to improve her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Many years ago, Betty started a business making cleaning products and soaps with the fresh scent of strawberry, apple, watermelon and peach.  In the beginning her business did well.  But then the supermarkets started to appear and sales fell because she couldn't compete.  After that, Betty began a new business preparing typical Peruvian dishes.  She's been running her new business for 3 years now, and her customers frequent her small restaurant for the delicious meals she prepares.   The busiest days are the weekends, when she sells every meal she prepares, making this a very good business.  Going forward, she would like to have another business that will generate more income, so she is considering opening a small general store in her home.   This is Betty's 13th loan with MFP and she has complied with all of her payments.  As a leader in her group she sets a good example.  With the new loan, she will purchase ingredients to prepare her meals, as well as a display case for her new general store.  In this way she hopes to diversify her income and economic situation.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Charnes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":596809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase ingredients to prepare the meals she sells, as well as a display case for the small general store she is opening in her home.

17. She sells used clothes in the Nyamasaria slum, where she also lives. All her children are in school, but as a widow (her husband died in 2006), she is supporting her family herself. Her business is the source of all her income and the highest cost for her is transporting her goods. She would like Kiva lenders to know that her living standard is probably lower compared to theirs, that food security is weak and that it is hard to send her children to school due to lack of funds. She is asking for 30,000 Kenyan Shillings to buy more clothing stock. \r\n<P>\r\nRose recently joined the K-MET volunteer Community Health Worker (CHW) group in Kisumu, Kenya. As a CHW she will be trained by K-MET and will begin visiting members of her community who are sick with a variety of illness. Her work will include distributing Nutriflour (a vitamin enriched flour produced by K-MET) to malnourished patients, providing reproductive health education, referring patients to local clinics and hospitals, and providing basic health care.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

She is a young divorced woman with one child in her care, who is at school. Cyrielle lives alone with her child and covers the child's expenses. Cyrielle has only been to primary school. About four years ago she started selling kitchenware (ice-boxes, plates, bowls, seals and plastic washing baskets) through the distribution system. This activity generates income that Cyrielle uses to cover the upkeep and education of her child. Cyrielle buys her products in Nigeria and Togo, two countries which border B\u00e9nin. She is an old client of ALID\u00e9 who repays her loans without problem. Much in demand from her customers, Cyrielle's ambition is to strengthen her capital and expand her display of goods; this will allow her to meet the ever rising demand. It is the reason for which she is applying for a fourth loan from ALID\u00e9. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

From here to Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda, it is a one-hour drive.\r\n\r\nThelesphore is the leader of this group, which consists of eight members; this group is called Intambwe.

This income will enable him to educate his children and provide for the basic needs of the family.\r\n\r\nHis main challenges have been lack of technical knowledge on disease and pest control, lack of storage facilities and proper markets for his products.

Zafarjon is 37 years old. He is married and has 3 children. Zafarjon is the sole breadwinner and his only income comes from the cultivation and sale of large livestock at the local market. Every year, he buys young heifers from the farms in adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife and children and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers.  Zafarjon would like to expand his business, as the income from his existing herd isn't enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase additional young cattle. To do this, he needs to invest an additional $1000 USD in his business. Zafarjon has applied for a loan for this amount from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Nutrients and chemical fertilizers are needed throughout the process. Currently, Francisco is having difficulties getting into the market with his product due to the fact that he doesn't have enough organic matter to incoporate into the soil.

She lives with her husband and children in the K\u00f4k\u00f4 district, in Koutiala prefecture (Region of Sikasso).  For societal reasons, she did not go to school.  She soon got interested in revenue-generating work, something she learned from her mother.  After having tried several kinds of work unsuccessfully, she ended up five years ago opting to sell firewood.  It should be noted that Fatoumata has 20 years of experience in the commerce of various goods.  Firewood is one of the essential elements for women in Mali when preparing food.  \r\n<p>\r\nConcerned about building a sizable stock of firewood in anticipation of the off-season, when firewood shortages are crucial, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is now on her first individual loan.  \r\n<p>\r\nMs. Fatoumata envisions using this loan to buy two truckloads of firewood from rural producers around Koutiala.

Desde peque\u00f1o se dedica a la siembra y al cuidado de sus cultivos agr\u00edcolas, por lo que aprendi\u00f3 las t\u00e9cnicas de esta actividad que ahora realiza con mucha precisi\u00f3n. Alejandro sabe c\u00f3mo y cu\u00e1ndo sembrar la papa, arveja y ma\u00edz, por eso muchas veces sus vecinos le piden consejo para sus cultivos y esto lo reconforta y anima a seguir compartiendo sus conocimientos. La dificultad de Alejandro es en el momento de la comercializaci\u00f3n de sus productos en el mercado, pues tiene problemas de audici\u00f3n y no habla muy claro, adem\u00e1s su esposa es analfabeta y se limita a cuidar los productos mientras \u00e9l se esfuerza en hacerse entender con sus clientes. Pese a esta discapacidad tiene planes de surgir, por ello piensa comprar una motosierra para talar \u00e1rboles de su chacra y poder vender le\u00f1a, gener\u00e1ndose as\u00ed un ingreso adicional. Este es su octavo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, demostrando ser un cliente muy responsable y que le gusta asistir a todas las reuniones de su banco comunal para estar enterado de los acuerdos de su grupo. El dinero que solicita lo invertir\u00e1 en la comprar 20 sacos de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos, calcula que le costar\u00e1 un aproximado de 2300 soles, con el resto del dinero comprar\u00e1 bolsas de arvejas (semilla). ","en":"\r\nAlejandro is 43 years old, he is a very noble and hard working man who lives in his own home. Since he was little he has spent time planting and taking care of his crops, so he was able to learn all the techniques of this activity, and now he does it with great precision. Alejandro knows how and when to plant potatoes, peas and corn, so many neighbors ask for his advice for their crops. This has reassured and encouraged him to continue sharing his knowledge. \r\n\r\nAlejandro's difficulty; however,  is in selling his products at the market as he has trouble hearing and speaking very clearly, besides this, his wife is illiterate and simply looks after the goods as he strives to understand their customers. Despite his disability, he has plans to grow his business, so he plans to buy a chainsaw to cut trees from his farm to sell as firewood, thus generating additional income. \r\n\r\nThis is his eighth loan from MFP and he is proving to be a very responsible member. He likes to attend all meetings of his community bank in order to be aware of all the arrangements made for his group. The money he is requesting is for the purchase of 20 bags of chemical fertilizers, the cost is estimated to be approximately 2300 suns, with the rest of the money being used to purchase peas (seed).<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariana Hungria, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":352994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing fertilizer and seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-16T15:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3020,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734051}],"funded_date":"2009-07-16T19:45:56Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Hungria","image":null}},{"id":126291,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Our featured entrepreneur is a young and active vendor of <i>balot<\/i> (incubated 18 day old duck eggs).

They live in Maricaban, Pasay City.\r\n\r\n<p>Julita sells small spare parts for bicycles and motorcycles, as well as small industrial supplies. Her store is not large but since it is located on one of the city\u2019s busy streets she is always busy attending to customers. She laments that she can\u2019t have quality time with her children anymore, so she has hired two assistants to tend to customers. Julita now earns a net income of close to P300,000.00 a month.\r\n\r\n<p>Her loans from the cooperative and profits earned from her business have helped her to expand her store. She was also able to buy a family vehicle. In the future, she hopes to be able to establish another store in a different location. Julita is now teaching her children the value of hard work at a young age, as she wants them to inherit her business skills.   \r\n\r\n<p>Julita is currently applying for a loan in the amount of P50,000.00 for the expansion of her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>About CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

They all have high competition to face so they put great effort into their work in order to obtain good results.\r\n\r\nThe funds will be used to innovate and, in some cases, to increase stock merchandise and ingredients; some will repair work tools in order to obtain better income for the support of their families and the wellbeing of their children, who are the motivating force behind their wanting to continue working.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":505625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"For vehicle maintenance and repair","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-03-16T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Primitivo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Javier Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leidy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernardo Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":12875,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1221.31},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1235.56},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1249.98},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1264.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1279.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1294.26},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1309.31},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1324.61},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1340.06},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1356.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.49},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.54},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.6},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.98},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":898.16,"local_amount":6250.74,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6265.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673420},{"amount":430.15,"local_amount":2993.58,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3000.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707477},{"amount":134.29,"local_amount":934.6,"processed_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:37Z","rounded_local_amount":936.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151890998},{"amount":192.55,"local_amount":1340.06,"processed_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1343.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151890999},{"amount":194.85,"local_amount":1356.02,"processed_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-02T08:35:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1359.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631358}],"funded_date":"2010-03-31T08:09:35Z","paid_date":"2010-09-02T08:35:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":188605,"name":"Homero","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El joven Homero G\u00f3mez es soltero y vive solo en su hogar, el labora para una empresa de noticias y publicaciones diarias, desde hace 5 a\u00f1os, y esta tramitando este cr\u00e9dito para la construcci\u00f3n de una barda en el frente de su casa para mayor seguridad, ya que por razones de trabajo su casa esta sola en el transcurso del d\u00eda. \n\n","en":"Young Homero G\u00f3mez is single and lives alone in his home.
