She is blessed with two children. Shehas been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years. On her farm, Susan grows maize, has a dairy cow, and keeps poultry. She sells milk, eggs, and maize. When she is not farming, she engages in some personal business to help supplement the income she earns. Despite her low earnings, farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction. \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" she says. Susan's biggest challenge is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. For a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Susan formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports small rural farmers. She is seeking a loan to buy a dairy cow and is planning to become a full-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. With this loan, Susan is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, good health, and a good

Alice also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Alice's Group will be able to receive a total of 13 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 8.75 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1795169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-03-25T03:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-24T03:00:04Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Biliah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Redempta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wycliffe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Theresa N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice L","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maxwel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan A","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maxmillah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":150690,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150690}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-02T17:39:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":858183,"name":"Ma.

She is the oldest, and so the responsibility of supporting the family rests on her shoulders.\r\n\r\nPhumla, together with her sister have identified a business opportunity that will help improve their family\u2019s lives. Phumla sources empty bottles from local pubs as well as neighbourhood shops, after which she cleans the bottles, packs them and sells them to a recycling firm where they are weighed and priced accordingly. \r\n\r\nShe needs a loan to buy four large containers that can hold much more bottles compared to the sisal sacks that the business currently uses. In addition, part of the loan will also help secure transport as they will be able to hire a pick-up truck for delivering to the recycling plant. \r\n\r\nPhumla is passionate about her community. She is smart and ambitious and hopes to create channels for her community to benefit through this project. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":87.51,"image":{"id":1839667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy four large containers for washing bottles for recycling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Freedom Park, Soweto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":445,"posted_date":"2015-03-25T05:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-24T05:00:11Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.64,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phumla Patience","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZAR","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.74,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T18:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":352.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.43,"payment_id":711660349},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:06:51Z","rounded_local_amount":352.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731164792},{"amount":26.96,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":352.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.21,"payment_id":752252554}],"funded_date":"2015-03-25T07:10:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Revie","image":692978}},{"id":858509,"name":"Virgen De Guadalupe Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Virgen de Guadalupe  est\u00e1 en el 4\u00ba ciclo  del programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres, tambi\u00e9n forman parte del programa de eliminaci\u00f3n de la pobreza, con el cual pueden conocer su situaci\u00f3n de vida, para poder ir mejor\u00e1ndola.\nUna de las integrantes es la Sra.

However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past 10 years. She is an early riser who goes to her farm to earn a living. Jane has space on her farm to use for dairy farming, so she respectfully requests a loan to buy a dairy cow. \r\n\r\nKapsowar is an area that has a large population and there is a high demand for milk. Jane, being an enterprising person, wants to take full advantage of that need and earn extra income. She hopes that this loan will allow her to change her standard of living and expand her milk-selling business. Jane plans to open a very large milk-selling business in the nearby shopping center and to package milk. She wants to be economically empowered.

On the farm, she grows vegetables that she uses for both consumption and sale. This business has enabled her to raise nine children. Alice's own upbringing was so difficult that she never had the privilege of attending school. \r\n\r\nAlice is seeking a loan to venture into commercial poultry farming. With the loan, she will acquire a brood of hens that will lay eggs for food, sale and hatching. This business is projected to significantly increase her income. The birds will also bring life into her home, as they will be free-range and scratch the earth for bugs. The money from the investment will enable Alice to afford basic needs and save up for the future.

day, lenders! We\u2019d like you to meet one of Ruma's agents, Sakroni. Sakroni lives in East Serang, located about two hours from Jakarta, the capital city. Sakroni owns a stall that sells daily consumer products. Sakroni just joined Ruma at the end of last year. He decided to join Ruma because he wants to expand his business more in technology. \r\n\r\nSakroni has become an agent for Ruma\u2019s layaway product designed for lower income communities called \"Mapan.\" Mapan enables customers to save up, little by little, by depositing change at agents and as their balance grows, it allows customers to make major asset purchases like housewares, appliances, and school supplies for their children.  \r\n\r\nAs a Mapan agent, Sakroni is responsible for processing deposits from customers into their Mapan accounts as well as receiving orders from customers who want to buy products listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Chutzorop is a small community, near Chichicastenango, where the principle language is the Mayan dialect of \u201cKiche\u201d. Spanish is not spoken by many in the village. \r\n\r\nCatarina, a member of the Trust Bank, is a 41-year-old married mother of 10 children who range in age from 3 to 23 years. She is beginning her 3rd loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. Neither she nor her husband - who is a farm laborer - have ever had any formal education, and they both work hard to support their large family. They are very pleased that 5 of their children have completed their studies and graduated. \r\n\r\nCatarina has a textile business and sells in the local market held twice a week. She makes colorful and ornate traditional blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d, belts or \u201cfajas\u201d, shawls or \u201cchalines\u201d, and cloths or \u201ctsutes\u201d that she also sells by the dozen at the wholesale level. Because of the success of her business, Catarina has two employees who help her keep plenty of inventory on hand. She is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase various colors and textures of high-quality thread as well as other supplies for her business.\r\n\r\nCatarina and her friends in the \u201cChutzoropense\u201d Trust Bank understand the value of education and know that their children need to be in school in order to enjoy a better and more prosperous future. Participating in the \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of Friendship Bridge (small loans + non-formal education), the ladies learn about many useful and relevant subjects from a Loan Officer in their own native language at their monthly meetings. \r\n\r\nThe ladies in the \u201cChutzoropence\u201d Trust Bank are greatly aided by the \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of Friendship Bridge. Kiva investors play a large role in funding these life-changing loans. We look forward to providing a follow-up report on Catarina and her friends in the Trust Bank in the rural area of Chutzorop, Guatemala.

","en":"Yolanda, age 36, is the owner of a store located in the city of Barranquilla.  She sells snack foods, provisions, and general household goods.  Yolanda started her business 10 years ago, following the tradition of her parents and almost everyone else in her family who work as merchants.  As she was growing up, Yolanda saw the benefits of having a store, such as being able to attend to her family and meeting her household obligations.  In addition, she could generate an income to support her family, which consists of her husband and her two young children (ages 1 and 2).  She had no doubts about starting this business.  Today her main customers are women with families who purchase with cash.  Yolanda works every day from 7:00 A.M. to 9:00 P.M.

They all live in Bilwi, Puerto Cabezas. They organized six months ago with the purpose of working in solidarity to access loans in Pana Pana to have the opportunity to improve their small businesses, improve their incomes and improve the quality of life for their families. Bismona is a Miskito community of the Autonomous Region of the North Caribbean Coast ( RACCN ).\r\n\r\nAndrea Isaura is a member of the solidarity group. She is an optimistic 30-year-old of Miskito ethnicity. She is married and has a 3-year-old son. Her husband works informally as a taxi driver. She established a small grocery store 3 years ago in the hallway of her wooden, tambo-style home with the goal of having her own source of income and to help with household expenses. She is requesting her third financing to buy basic grains and Chiver\u00edas dairy products, among other products. With the previous loan granted by Pana Pana and funded through KIVA, she was able to diversify her products and now also sells baked beans, vegetables and provisions. She dreams of owning a used clothing store and expanding her small store.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the loan previously granted by Pana Pana and funded by KIVA, along with financial support from her husband, allowed Elsa Juana, coordinator of the solidarity Group Bismona, to slowly build 6 rooms of wood to rent. She is still engaged in peddling beauty products and has diversified her products to offer articles covered in gold and steel.

By using a cash and credit system, he works every day starting at 8:00 A.M. and ends at 4:00 P.M.  He buys his goods at stores in the city that offer competitive prices.  His goals are to increase his business sales and purchase a house in the future.  <br \/><br \/>Belisario is currently applying for a Kiva loan, his first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use the money to buy jeans, sweaters, sweatshirts, earrings, and various women\u2019s accessories since women are his main customers.  This investment will provide new capital that will allow him to broaden his purchases so that he can sell more, which is his main goal."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":270.55,"image":{"id":1835355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to buy jeans, sweaters, sweatshirts, earrings, and various women\u2019s accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-03-25T19:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-24T19:40:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.86,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belisario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":89328},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":90758},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":93481},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":96285},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":99174},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":102149},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":105213},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":108370},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":111621},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":114969},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":118418},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":120234}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.51},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.35},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.65},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.73,"local_amount":89328,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":93186.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649571930},{"amount":36.3,"local_amount":90758,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":94678.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666497295},{"amount":37.39,"local_amount":93481,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":97519.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681350408},{"amount":37.04,"local_amount":96285,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":100444.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.47,"payment_id":696560680},{"amount":37.61,"local_amount":99174,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":103458,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.06,"payment_id":711475424},{"amount":40.36,"local_amount":102149,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":106561.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.5,"payment_id":730994299},{"amount":39.26,"local_amount":105213,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:22:25Z","rounded_local_amount":109757.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.83,"payment_id":752082262}],"funded_date":"2015-04-22T21:08:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":858735,"name":"Jesusa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jesusa is 55 years old and married with four children.

Workers can become heavily indebted to money lenders who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. \n\nFor this reason Litan is asking for your assistance to help him circumvent loan sharks. He has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem in repaying them since the loan payments were automatically deducted from his paycheck. He is seeking a 10,000 PHP loan to pay for his children\u2019s educational expenses.\n\nLitan wants for his children to complete their schooling and have a better future. He looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. \n\nCCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force and equip them with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness, and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.\n\nCCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers such as Litan before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and after-work hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line

She works hard to augment their income to pay for their daily household needs and the schooling of her children.\r\n\r\nSusan has been running a direct selling business for 11 years already. She sells beauty products, generic medicines, and dish-washing soaps. Her regular customers are her neighbors, friends, family, and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,500 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her sustain her business, she is requesting a PHP 35,000 loan, which she will use to pay for goods to sell at her retail store, including personal beauty items such as lotion, face and body powder, and whitening soaps, as well as generic medicines and dish-washing soaps. Filipinos prefer to buy branded personal goods for their good quality, while they are given to buying generic medicines instead of the branded ones for economic reasons. Susan is thanking God and you in advance for a good return of her investment and for the financial help that will be given to her, for it will surely help cover their daily needs and her children's education.   \r\n\r\nSusan aims to grow her business and send her children to the best schools. Her dream is to see her children become professionals someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1840331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

","en":"Nazgul is 43 and married with four children. She has a specialist high school education and has been working in agriculture for 20 years as a source of income for her family. She started her business with 8,000 KGS and currently brings in a good income.

She was not making enough money to care for her daughter. Then Bianca received her first Kiva loan. This solved her working capital problem, and she was able to serve more customers and earn more income. This allowed her to take her daughter to nursery school, which made her very happy. Bianca then accessed a second loan which she used to finance a trading booth at a new location. She has successfully repaid both loans.\r\n\r\nBianca\u2019s business has grown and become more successful. She has set up two additional outlets and employs three people to help with her business. It makes her very happy to have a positive impact in her community by providing a good service as well as jobs. \r\n\r\nBianca\u2019s third loan will help her to continue to scale her business. She will be able to operate her outlets more efficiently with the additional capital to service customers.

Now it\u2019s time for us to introduce you to one of Ruma\u2019s new agents, Yusuf. Yusuf lives in Indramayu, a city located about four hour\u2019s drive from Jakarta. Yusuf is happily married and together with his wife they have a 3 year-old son. As the main source of income, Yusuf owns and manages a small stall that sell mobile phone sim cards, mobile phone airtime credits and utility bill payments service to his community. Yusuf just joined Ruma last month because he wanted to improve his business and he was excited to learn more about mobile technology from the Ruma mobile application. \r\n\r\nNow, Yusuf has become an agent for Ruma\u2019s e-commerce for lower economic communities, called 'Mapan'. By serving Mapan to his customers, Yusuf will be able to receive orders from customers who want to buy products that have been listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer orders, Yusuf will simply send an SMS message in a format to an SMS center; the customer will pay him and a Ruma agent will come to his stall to collect the money.
