She looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. <br \/><br \/>CCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.<br \/><br \/>CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers such as Emilia before starting their daily work routine.

in North Lebanon. He is currently engaged but lives alone, having lost his parents when he was younger. Growing up without financial support, Said quickly learned how to manage his income and make ends meet right after he graduated from school. Today, he is hoping he can start his own family and provide his future wife with good living conditions. \nIn late 2013, Said started running his own business. He opened a coffee shop in a busy street of the camp where he has little competition. He sells soda, juice and sweets to loyal customers who see him as a responsible young man planning for his future. \nHe is asking for a 3,083,000 Lebanese pounds loan for the first time from Kiva partner Ibdaa.

Cathierin works as a seamstress, sewing clothes according to the company's or client\u2019s requirements. She uses a sewing machine and other stitching machines and hand-stitches hems and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Cathierin is meeting family expenses without having access to savings or credit. Workers can become heavily indebted to money lenders who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Cathierin is asking for your assistance to help her circumvent loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem with repaying them since the loan payments were automatically deducted from her paycheck. She is seeking a loan of 10,000 Philippine pesos to pay for the expenses of her child's baptism.\r\n\r\nCathierin hopes that her family will always be healthy and happy. She looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. \r\n\r\nCCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force, equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site-development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring these skills, which are necessary for finding quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness and providing decent shelter, food and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development and Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\nCCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers such as Cathierin before they start their daily work routines. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and after-work hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1840493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for baptismal expenses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-03-26T00:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-25T00:20:04Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cathierin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1261.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187288},{"amount":56.26,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2522.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536319},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2522.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017534},{"amount":56.24,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2522.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313951},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1261.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522669}],"funded_date":"2015-03-26T01:42:18Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Pike","image":2004103}},{"id":855364,"name":"Roeun's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Living in a house located in the Koh Sotin district of Kompong Cham province, Roeun is 31 years old and married.

His fatherly love has been enough to show him that he needs to work hard to help his children get ahead with excellent values and education. \r\n\r\nPeter, 46, is a smallholder farmer in the Kitale area of Kenya. In the past twenty years, he has bred more than one dairy cow and sheep and has developed his farm. He has also planted and sold a variety of crops. He says the secret to his success is thinking of farming as a way to make money, not just as a traditional way of life \u2013 adopting new technologies and methods, crop diversification, record-keeping and good planning also help. \r\n\r\nPeter was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that his family faced. However, he never gave up and he has been practicing farming. Because of how much he likes farming, he has even nicknamed one of his cows \u201cMaua\u201d (flower) which makes him a very proud farmer, especially when he is milking his cows. Through his dairy cow, he is able to get between 5-10 liters a day, and this helps him support his family. \r\n\r\nPeter also practices crop farming, but he has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements, and that is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, he will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer, and pesticides that he will use to greatly improve his crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques; using high-quality seeds will assure him of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. \r\n\r\nPeter is visionary, and his goal for the season is to boost his crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year. All this can be achieved through lenders\u2019 help and goodwill. Peter believes that through the loan, he will turn around his family life and be able to give his child a solid educational background. This loan will be Peter\u2019s way out of poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":190.17,"image":{"id":1840510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy farm implements","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-26T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-25T04:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.71,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.86,"local_amount":2473.95,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:34:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2651.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601503},{"amount":23.74,"local_amount":2034.66,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2180.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460008},{"amount":27.32,"local_amount":2354.35,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2523.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.15,"payment_id":681378435},{"amount":21.46,"local_amount":1918.11,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2055.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.92,"payment_id":711506407},{"amount":54.36,"local_amount":4759.95,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5101.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.17,"payment_id":731023232},{"amount":31.72,"local_amount":2759.49,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2957.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.47,"payment_id":752111391}],"funded_date":"2015-03-27T09:31:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":858870,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is a 46-year-old married woman and a mother of four children from Leyte, Philippines.

She is an entrepreneurial woman who has been making a living farming for the last two years, in an attempt to give her family the best. She does so through her friendly manner and the good way in which she manages her finances. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kitale, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Metrine is happily married and together with her husband, blessed with one lovely child. For the past two years, she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been growing maize and a variety of food crops. Metrine has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. <br \/><br \/>Although she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Metrine mobilized other women in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy another motorbike. Metrine is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge; hence she has suffered so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables, and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price and through this loan Metrine is going to achieve her dream and goals. <br \/><br \/>Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Metrine feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical, because Metrine will never suffer losses due to delays in delivery of produce to the market and also, she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market, hence increasing her income level. Metrine is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping with farmwork. With your loan, Metrine will improve her living conditions and assure her child of a secure future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":359.01,"image":{"id":1840535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy another motorbike for timely delivery of produce to the market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-26T06:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-25T06:40:01Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Metrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1759.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1811.26},{"due_date":"2015-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1864.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1918.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1974.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2032.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2091.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2153},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2215.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2280.68},{"due_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2347.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2415.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2486.54},{"due_date":"2016-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2559.21},{"due_date":"2016-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2634},{"due_date":"2016-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2710.98},{"due_date":"2016-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2790.21},{"due_date":"2016-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2871.75},{"due_date":"2016-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2955.68},{"due_date":"2016-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3042.06},{"due_date":"2016-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3130.96},{"due_date":"2016-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3222.46},{"due_date":"2017-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3316.68},{"due_date":"2017-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3413.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.97},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.41},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.18},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.97},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.79},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.63},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.39},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.31},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.25},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.22},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.22},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.31},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":115.28,"local_amount":10247.33,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:34:10Z","rounded_local_amount":10590.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601504},{"amount":233.73,"local_amount":21665.08,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:42Z","rounded_local_amount":22390.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10,"payment_id":711506408}],"funded_date":"2015-04-19T13:55:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":858891,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria earns a living offering printing and photocopying services.

She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in paying it back since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day.

Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.<br \/><br \/>** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine.

She uses a sewing machine and other stitching machines, as well as hand-stitching hems and linings.<br \/><br \/>One of the main dilemmas of employees like Melitona is meeting family expenses without access to savings or credit. Workers can become heavily indebted to money lenders, who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. <br \/><br \/>For this reason Melitona is asking for your assistance to help her circumvent loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem in repaying them, since the loan payments were automatically deducted from her paycheck. She is seeking a 9,000 PHP loan to pay for her pawned ATM card.<br \/><br \/>Melitona wants to manage her own \"sari-sari\" store (variety store). She looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. <br \/><br \/>CCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.<br \/><br \/>CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers before starting their daily work routine.

Meet Everline, who, with her partner, has become a very good smallholder farmer. They didn't just get together romantically; they joined their hands in improving their farm to create financial strength for the home that they share. She is happily married and has been practicing mixed farming for the last 14 years and has gained so much experience. \r\n\r\nTo afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling eggs and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has also been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Kitale area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable. She stated that what she like best is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high. \r\n\r\nShe lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman, she finds that accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry sales to other markets. This will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children.

They have no access to savings or credit, a situation that makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Winson is asking for your assistance to prevent him from being exposed to any loan sharks. He has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative, and he had no problem in returning it back since the loan payment is being deducted every payday. He looks forward to your positive response, and any help from you will surely be of great help. \r\n\r\nHe will use the loan primarily to redeem the pawned deed of their house. \r\n\r\nWinson wants to be successful someday. He desires to give his family a better future through all his hard work. He meets up with his co-fellowship** members to share stories of his work.\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services. \r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meeting for the factory workers before they start their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1840596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to redeem the pawned deed of his house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-03-26T14:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-25T14:20:12Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Winson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1307.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636187295},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2615.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536326},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2615.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017541},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2615.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313958},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2615.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522676},{"amount":58.32,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2615.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711432918},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1307.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954197}],"funded_date":"2015-03-26T19:17:12Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T13:32:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":858953,"name":"Melody Women Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In 2014, Melody Women Group joined Hand in Hand Eastern Africa in order to be trained, especially in enterprise development and financial management.

He is married to Gregornia, a homemaker who manages their household, and has two children. He has a retail store to continually provide for his family\u2019s daily personal and household needs.\r\n\r\nManuel operates a small general store. In the Philippines, a sari-sari store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. He earns profit by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from his general store, he is also a dealer of natural and organic products. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help him continue operation of his business, he is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan which he will use to buy grocery items such as corn, rice, canned goods, noodles, sugar, and cooking oil. With part of the loan, he will also pay for natural and organic juice and capsules to meet orders from his clients. He is positive this will boost his income as he expands his business. He is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given him, for it will surely cover their everyday needs and the schooling of his children.\r\n\r\nManuel aims to grow his business to improve their status in life. He wants to give his children the best education possible and see them become professionals someday. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1840606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Meet Grace from the Nandi Hills area of Kenya, an area that is very fertile. Grace is 33 years old and a proud mother of four lovely angel-looking children, whom she really adores and cherishes. \r\n\r\nAside from doing a side hustle business, Grace is a hardworking farmer who has been farming for the past seventeen years. She has gained so much experience through those years of farming. Grace practices mixed farming, that is, she grows maize and keeps dairy cows. Through these activities she has been able to earn a decent and honest income. Because of the passion she has for farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows Lelgina. She really enjoys taking care of her dairy cows. \r\n\r\nAlthough Grace has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious mum. She needs to increase her land. She is respectfully requesting for a loan to buy more land.

Today, Nina already has a dairy cow with a calf and 6 sheep, also grows beans and sells milk on a daily basis. Nina tries to find any opportunity to earn money for her family, but because her earnings are not enough for a decent life, she decided to develop her business and requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) from the Bai-Tushum Bank to buy cows for fattening up and resale.

Her husband needs to do maintenance on his taxi, because the current condition of his taxi is not good. It requires more maintenance charges on daily basis. Due to insufficient financial means, her husband is unable to do maintenance on his taxi. Therefore, Nargis has applied for Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan, Nargis's husband can afford the maintenance cost easily. This will enable him to provide the better transport facilities to earn a profitable income.

When you ask, he\u2019ll tell you his most valuable asset is his farm. But it wasn\u2019t always this way. For a long time, Oyugi\u2019s farm couldn\u2019t even sustain his family. In 2013, he heard about Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance institution that serves smallholder farmers. And from that day, life has never been the same. Oyugi is happily married and, together with his beautiful wife, he is blessed with five lovely children. For the past 30 years, he has been practicing mixed farming and his primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. He sells milk and farm produce to his neighbors and to the local market. However, he has been facing one big problem and that is the timely delivery of his products to the market. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike that would solve his transportation problem. Keera is located in a very remote area that has a poor road network and the terrain is very bad. The only mode of transport is a motorbike. This loan will be of great help because it will allow Oyugi to transport his farm products to the market and deliver them in a timely manner. Milk and vegetables are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market in order to fetch high prices.

With the loan from Kiva, she would pay workers who harvested maize. The profits from the business will be used to improve her welfare. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

 is 46 years old; she is a married woman.  She deals in a business selling animals. She buys animals (baby goats and calves) at low prices, brings them up, and then sells them out in the market at higher prices. She makes enough through her business to contribute to the family income.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

With the loan from Kiva, he would like to pay workers who harvested maize. The profits from the business will be used to renovate his house.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She is married with two children, who are one and three years old and do not yet go to school. She is a farmer and has been growing maize for the past 10 years. Her husband is a businessman. With the loan from Kiva, she would like to pay workers who harvested maize. The profits from the business will be used to increase her savings.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Due to a lack of money, she could not continue with her studies. She is a single mom, but fortunately, the child's father helps with some expenses. Wendy currently lives with her mother and her siblings. From the age of 16, Wendy started selling clothing door to door in the townships. She has approximately 8 years of doing this work.

He currently grows oranges on nine acres, and his farm is his main source of income. He is also a commercial driver, which provides him additional income to support his family. It is clear that Gibridu is enterprising and hardworking. \r\n\r\nHowever, he still finds farming challenging because of the high financial costs of maintenance. In particular, he has to hire many labourers to weed, prune and harvest the crops. He also has to purchase important agricultural inputs such as fertiliser and insect traps. Without such inputs, the crops are susceptible to being attacked by fruit flies and will not grow well. \r\n\r\nA loan will allow him to purchase these essential inputs and help increase his yield significantly, and his profits would far exceed the capital he needs to invest in his farms now.

The profits from the business will be used to pay school fees of her children and improve her welfare.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.
