The climate is dry and cold, with a temperature that varies between 0 and 12 degrees Celsius (32 and 54 degrees Fahrenheit) during the day.

They live in their own home\u2014an adobe house that has a corrugated iron roof, electricity, and a well water.\r\n\r\nHis business is selling cattle. He is in charge of visiting the livestock shows in the area looking for calves to fatten them and then sell them. This occupation takes up all of his time because his business is nonstop. He says that \"selling cattle is an ancient occupation that is being practised a lot in this area \u2026\" \r\n\r\nThe advantage of his business is his lifetime experience in the field, and the disadvantage is the area's climate, which causes a shortage of fodder.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to build a big stall where he can fit more cattle. He wants to purchase beef and dairy cattle to fatten and sell.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan cycle with the institution in 11 years that he has been following this occupation independently.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Jhonny is requesting a loan to purchase beef and dairy cattle to raise and sell for the best price.

What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers, selling these items with a little profit. Her products include men and women\u2019s pants and other similar products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options that Elisa offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her to continue operating her business, Elisa is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will utilize the loan to buy bed sheets, women's clothes, pants, rejuvenating sets and bleach to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as her business expands.\r\n\r\nElisa hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for more than eight years, and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She also makes and sells rugs for her additional profit. She earns a minimum of Php 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Estelita would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell.

Her business is located in the Plan 4000 neighborhood, characterized by its urban distribution, having a ring-like structure. It was the first city in the country that had a master plan and an industrial park which established the urban development in its initial and modern stages. It has a warm, tropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 22 and 35 degrees centigrade. \r\n\r\nSara has dark skin, is short, has long brown hair that she ties back and keeps highlighted, brown eyes, thin physique, dresses fashionably, her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for the business she does. She lives her life in the company of her parents who work. They live in their own house made of brick and cement with a metal sheeting roof that has water, electricity and sewer services. Her business is making and selling traditional breads such as cu\u00f1ap\u00e9 (a small roll made of yucca flower with cheese) , empanada de arroz (a baked good with rice and cheese), zonzo (mashed yucca mixed with cheese and made into a stick shape then baked in the oven), bizcochos de trigo (hard rolls made of wheat flour), salte\u00f1a (light dough made of wheat, filled with meat, potatoes, boiled eggs, and vegetables, and baked), a business that she began a year ago from her house, making a small investment. She also bakes vanilla cakes and chocolate pastries that use ingredients easy to find in the market. As she recovered her capital, she invested in her bread sales. \"The bread of Santa Cruz is characterized as being very flavorful, one adds a lot of milk and ingredients...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she does it in her house and doesn't have to go to another site.  The disadvantage of her business is that she doesn't have the production capacity to sell in bulk, due to having a small oven.  Her dream is to have a large bakery and sell in bulk to the neighborhood stores. She wants to purchase an industrial oven and a cylinder of gas to expand her business. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 1 year she has been doing this work.  \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Sara asks for a loan to purchase an industrial oven and a cylinder of gas to sell bread to neighborhood stores in bulk.

She runs her business in the Los Chacos neighbourhood of the Plan 3000 area. It\u2019s a rural area known for its groups of all kinds of manufacturers and wholesale distributors who deliver their products to the different markets of the town. The climate is tropical and very wet, with a temperature range of 22-35C throughout the year.\r\n\r\nMargarita is dark complexioned with long black hair that she wears tied back. She has brown eyes and is of small stature. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks with her family, and she also speaks Spanish for cultural and business purposes. In the photo she is sitting on the first seat on the right and is holding her baby. Her partner works in construction. They live in their own house built of bricks with a corrugated metal roof. They have electricity and get their water from a well.\r\n\r\nMargarita\u2019s wish to expand her business and improve sales led her to form a communal bank of business owners. The members of the group have business such as selling breakfasts, selling food, making ice cream, selling soft drinks, selling fruit, selling traditional baked food, selling flip flops, selling secondhand clothes, and selling cleaning products. They wish to obtain a loan and make their businesses more prosperous. \r\n\r\nMargarita sells traditional food. She uses meat, vegetables, and other items in the dishes she makes such as locro carretero cruce\u00f1o (soup made from dried meat cut into pieces, yucca and egg), chicharr\u00f3n de taitetu (fried wild pork), majao encapao (minced dried meat, boiled bananas, and rice), locotos rellenos (peppers stuffed with meat and onions) etc. She sells the dishes in the streets every day of the week pushing a 2-wheeled cart holding the pans full of food until she finds a shady spot with seats. Then she starts selling the food.\r\n\r\nShe goes to certain areas where she finds her customers and makes her sales. The advantage of her business is that her regular customers seek her out; the disadvantage is that she doesn\u2019t have tables and chairs. Margarita\u2019s dream is to have a restaurant where she can sell larger quantities of food. She wishes to buy tables and chairs for her new fixed premises and improve the service she offers her customers. Then she will increase sales. This is Margarita\u2019s second loan cycle in the four years she has been running her business. She is seeking a loan to buy tables and chairs so she can better look after her regular customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5225,"image":{"id":1841026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy tables and chairs for the regular customers at her food stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-27T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-26T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":5225,"lender_count":173,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica Vanes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Reina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocio Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faviola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-21T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":5225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-05T04:00:00Z","amount":2367.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T04:00:00Z","amount":2316.76},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T04:00:00Z","amount":2358.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T04:00:00Z","amount":2401.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T04:00:00Z","amount":2445.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T04:00:00Z","amount":2490.09},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T04:00:00Z","amount":2535.41},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T04:00:00Z","amount":2581.55},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T04:00:00Z","amount":2628.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T04:00:00Z","amount":2676.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T04:00:00Z","amount":2725.08},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T04:00:00Z","amount":2763.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T04:00:00Z","amount":2832.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T04:00:00Z","amount":2876.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.58},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":336.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":348.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":361.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":367.99},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":374.68},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":381.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":388.45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":395.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":401.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":417.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1725.75,"local_amount":11890.4,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":11924.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564568},{"amount":729.4,"local_amount":5025.5,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":5039.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046532},{"amount":756.18,"local_amount":5210.08,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5224.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344352},{"amount":2013.67,"local_amount":13874.02,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:09Z","rounded_local_amount":13913.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554567}],"funded_date":"2015-04-21T20:44:40Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":859622,"name":"Ma.

His wife is unemployed and his children have both graduated from school, education being a priority despite the financial instability the family is going through due to the surrounding environment. \nAfter 32 years of experience in the photography business, Mustapha succeeded in preserving a respectable reputation among his clients which encouraged him to have his son help him in the studio. \nHe is asking for a 2,569,000 Lebanese pounds loan to buy a new professional camera that will improve his work quality, keep his customers satisfied and hopefully attract new customers with the summer season approaching. A new equipment will make his work easier and allow him to expand by accepting more and more projects inside the camp which will increase his family's income.

She is a single mother of a 6-year-old child and a 1-year-old child.  Her business is the making and selling of chorizo sausage.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, enterprising, active, patient, responsible and hard-working.  Her business is carried out in the area \u201cMutualista,\u201d a central area that accommodates commercial buildings, universities, schools, many people and all types of businesses.  It has a warm, tropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 18 and 35 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nCarmen is dark-complexioned, short, thin, with brown eyes and long black tied-up hair. Her mother tongue is Guarani which she speaks with her family and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for the business that she is in. (In the photo she is in the centre, dressed in white and she has some papers in her hand.)\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her children.  The older one is starting school and the younger one is still a baby.  They live in a rented room made of brick and cement with a sheet-metal roof.  It has potable water, electricity and a sewer system.  Due to expenses and family necessities, she formed a bank of people with businesses such as food sales, vegetable sales, sale of second-hand clothing, sale of perfumes, sale of cleaning supplies, plumbing services and clothes-cleaning services in order to request a loan and to improve earnings.\r\n\r\nHer business is the making and selling of \u201cbeniano\u201d type of chorizo.  It is made with thin meat intestine, ground beef, ground pork, bacon, onion, chili peppers, vinegar, garlic, cumin, salt and pepper.  The procedure that she follows is:  she washes the intestines; in a frying pan she fries the onion with garlic; then mixes all the ingredients and with the help of a funnel she puts the ingredients inside the intestine; with a thread she ties the sides giving it the appropriate dimensions for a serving. \u201cI learned this recipe from my family.  Then I dedicated myself to this occupation as a way of life and because I can take care of my children and work,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that her recipe is very popular and on the weekends she sells chorizo wholesale for family barbecues.  The disadvantage is that she doesn't have sufficient capital to make a greater quantity of chorizos and increase her sales.  Her dream is to open a store to sell chorizos and sausages.  She wishes to be able to buy the ingredients for making chorizos wholesale.  This is the second sequence of loans with the institution in the 3 years that she has been carrying out this activity.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Carmen is asking for a loan to buy ingredients for making chorizos to sell wholesale and to open a sausage store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":1841085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to make chorizos to sell wholesale and to open a sausage store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-28T03:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-27T03:00:01Z","loan_amount":3350,"lender_count":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorenzo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jiovanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yelusi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-21T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-06T04:00:00Z","amount":1760.14},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T04:00:00Z","amount":1762.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T04:00:00Z","amount":1794.35},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T04:00:00Z","amount":1827},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T04:00:00Z","amount":1798.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T04:00:00Z","amount":1947.81},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T04:00:00Z","amount":1928.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T04:00:00Z","amount":1963.53},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T04:00:00Z","amount":1999.27},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":2035.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T04:00:00Z","amount":2072.71},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T04:00:00Z","amount":2110.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.68},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":261.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":261.94},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.7},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285.99},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":296.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.89},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1040.51,"local_amount":7143.76,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":7189.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564569},{"amount":826.52,"local_amount":5674.66,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5711,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046533},{"amount":577.19,"local_amount":3962.8,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3988.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344353},{"amount":905.78,"local_amount":6218.78,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":6258.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554568}],"funded_date":"2015-04-01T20:11:56Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rita","image":null}},{"id":859811,"name":"Felicidad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felicidad is 55 years old and married with eight children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by farming bananas in the Philippines.
