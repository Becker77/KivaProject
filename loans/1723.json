Her youngest son still lives at home and helps her with the housework.  Zhamila has a secondary level education and for many years, she has owned an agriculture business.  Today, Zhamila has two cows, six sheep, as well as 1.0 ha of land where she raises watermelon and corn.  Additionally, Zhamila has a place at the bazaar where she sells fruit including apples, persimmons, grapes, and mandarin oranges.  Her businesses bring in a monthly profit of 20,000 som (KGS), which is not enough to lead a decent life.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, Zhamila decided to expand her business and applied to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to buy cattle as well as fruit to sell at the bazaar.  Zhamila plans to use her future profits from the loan to further develop her

Her children are all adults.  Currently she receives a pension and has a cattle business.

With the profits from this coming season, Emily is planning to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nA total of 2.25 acres will be planted by Emily's Group, and between them they will receive a total of four solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1795444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, as well as a solar light.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-03-28T13:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-27T13:40:05Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pauline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dickson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":43820,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43820}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-29T10:47:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":859943,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is 32 years old, married, and has three children.  \r\n\r\nShe is in the agricultural business, raising pigs in the Philippines.

She is happily married, and together with her handsome husband, they are blessed with a lovely family. \r\n\r\nFor the past 20 years Hellen has been involved in mixed farming. Hellen has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good-quality dairy cow. \r\n\r\nDairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices have been going up in the recent past, so Hellen, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she knows that she will get not only milk from the cow but also manure, and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling her milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also be selling to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nHellen said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural-based loans, and their interest rate is both low and on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. \r\n\r\nHellen hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to add value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her children and ageing parents."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":291.84,"image":{"id":1841887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-28T15:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-27T15:20:05Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.08,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.21,"local_amount":5692.65,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5838.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"payment_id":681378441},{"amount":59.53,"local_amount":5397.85,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5536.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.68,"payment_id":696588106},{"amount":53.28,"local_amount":4977.01,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5104.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.23,"payment_id":711506414},{"amount":53.85,"local_amount":4926.94,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5053.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.1,"payment_id":731023237},{"amount":56.89,"local_amount":5171.07,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5303.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.79,"payment_id":752111396}],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T15:38:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":859972,"name":"Antonieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Antonieta is a married woman with four children.

She loves her family, which is the primary reason she fights every day and generates sustenance to survive. Today, this humble mother sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has of farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to Racheal's heart. Every day she wakes up to milk her cows, and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through selling milk, she lacks a proper dairy unit so she is seeking a loan to build one. Through the loan she will have a humble time milking and feeding her cows. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevents them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Racheal believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she will have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit. \r\n\r\nWith her drive and ambition, Racheal sees herself generating employment through hiring someone to help her in her dairy business.

Her tenacity and perseverance has enabled her to strive tirelessly, always looking for a way to get ahead. Her major sources of income are selling eggs, growing crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves poultry farming and when asked what is most enjoyable about poultry farming, her response was \u201cfeeding my poultry.\u201d She sells eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market. Because of high quality eggs, customers have been streaming into her compound and the demand has been overwhelming. To be able to meet the demand she is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan she will buy quality breeds of poultry that have high productivity and hence, satisfy the demand that is there. The increased income level will be used to improve her living conditions. She plans on expanding her business to other towns. Other than increased profits, she will also benefit from the poultry manure, which will be used in her vegetable garden to increase productivity. Increased profits will make her business flourish and provide a secure solid education for her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":218.93,"image":{"id":1841951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-28T18:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-27T18:20:06Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.77,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2477.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2549.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2623.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2700.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2779.57},{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2860.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2944.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3030.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3119.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3210.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3303.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3400.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.31},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.97,"local_amount":5159.72,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:34:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5422.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601511},{"amount":62.56,"local_amount":5498.29,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5777.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"payment_id":681378444},{"amount":29.03,"local_amount":2646.32,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2780.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.21,"payment_id":711506417},{"amount":53.71,"local_amount":4796.68,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5040.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.11,"payment_id":731023239},{"amount":11.89,"local_amount":1055.52,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1109.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.17,"payment_id":752111399}],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T11:56:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Richard Neuman","image":null}},{"id":860020,"name":"Manuela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manuela is 59 years old and married with three children.

Hasta el d\u00eda de hoy, sigue utilizando los cr\u00e9ditos para comprar m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda como pan, huevo, leche y productos enlatados y seguir ofreciendo un buen servicio.  \n\nHace poco, Alberto tambi\u00e9n invirti\u00f3 en un molino que renta a las personas de su comunidad para ganar un poco de dinero extra cada que sus vecinos necesitan moler ma\u00edz. Ambas actividades van avanzando a pesar de la competencia, su principal reto, pero Alberto a\u00fan sue\u00f1a con tener una panader\u00eda exitosa y dar empleo a otras personas. \n\nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo est\u00e1n muy agradecidos con Kiva y VisionFund M\u00e9xico por la oportunidad de invertir en sus negocios: Elisa invertir\u00e1 en pollos; Rogelio, en una tienda de abarrotes; Valentina, en borregos y pollos y N\u00e9stor, en escobetas.\n\n*En la imagen: los integrantes de pie frente al quiosco en el centro de su municipio, don Alberto viste una chamarra verde*\n","en":"In a community with traditions from the Mazahua culture, a group formed called \u201cLa Caba\u00f1uela\u201d in honor of Alberto's home which is made completely from wood. \r\n\r\nHe is a responsible and hard-working father, dedicated to his family. Although only two of his six children currently are still in school, his work in the countryside and in building houses helped him to bring food to the house, despite never really liking to work for other people. \r\n\r\nYears ago, Albert undertook his own business, opening a bakery. A few months later, the lack of support and capital caused him to close it. \"Then, I learned about VisionFund M\u00e9xico and it was a great hope for me because the loans have a very good interest rate.\" Later, he began to sell sweets, snacks and soft drinks. With a base in hard work and the following loans, the little table that Alberto installed to hold his sweets became a grocery store with a great variety of products. To date, he continues using loans to purchase more merchandise such as bread, eggs, milk, and canned goods and to continue offering good service. \r\n\r\nA little while ago, Alberto also invested in a mill that he rents to people in his community to earn a bit of extra money each time his neighbors need to grind corn. Both activities are advancing despite the competition, his primary challenge, but Alberto still dreams of having a successful bakery and employing other people. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are very grateful to Kiva and VisionFund M\u00e9xico for the opportunity to invest in their businesses. Elisa will invest in chickens, Rogelio in a grocery store, Valentina in sheep and chickens, and N\u00e9stor in hand brooms.\r\n\r\n*In the image: the members are standing in front of the kiosk at the center of their municipality.

She is a 49-year-old woman who has been a farmer for 10 years. She is based in Endebes village, where she has a one-acre farm and a small house made out of earth, with two habitable rooms. On the farm, she grows vegetables that she uses for both consumption and sale. This business has enabled her to raise three children. Irine's own upbringing was so difficult that she never had the privilege of attending school. She is seeking a loan to venture into commercial poultry farming. <br \/><br \/>With the loan, she will acquire a brood of hens that will lay eggs for food, sale and hatching.

She fights for her future with her own hands, and she does not expect anyone to give anything to her. \r\n\r\nShe is from Siongiroi, Kenya, a community not known for farming, but she is earning a living through agriculture. For the past five years, she has been practicing mixed farming. Because of the experience she has, she commands a lot of respect from her fellow farmers, and she is regarded as a mentor. \r\n\r\nThe income from milk, eggs, and maize selling have allowed her to earn a good income. To earn extra income, Betty engages in a small personal business. Betty passionately loves dairy farming. Milking and feeding her cow makes her very proud. Through selling milk, she has seen very good returns, and the demand for milk has been expanding. \r\n\r\nThrough extensive use of her mobile phone, she has been receiving orders from customers, and then sending text messages to her customers when milk is ready for collection, and because of using this, she has had a comparative edge in her dairy business. \r\n\r\nDemand has been overwhelming, and she needs an extra breed of cow to satisfy fully the demand. Betty requested a loan, which she will use to buy a quality dairy cow. She wants to buy a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce rich, creamy milk. The dairy cow will be producing between 15-20 liters of milk a day. The increased milk production will translate to more income, and Betty will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children. This loan will permanently change Betty\u2019s living standards."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275.31,"image":{"id":1841970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a quality breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-28T19:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-27T19:00:07Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.51,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.38,"local_amount":4808.4,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4931.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.25,"payment_id":681378445},{"amount":104.67,"local_amount":9776.3,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:44Z","rounded_local_amount":10026.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.37,"payment_id":711506418},{"amount":53.87,"local_amount":4928.39,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5054.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.1,"payment_id":731023240},{"amount":56.88,"local_amount":5170.64,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5302.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.79,"payment_id":752111400}],"funded_date":"2015-04-19T19:13:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":857700,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2457.25,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"increase her capital and buy a large amount of rice that she\u2019ll resell to earn more.

She keeps dairy animals and grows maize, bananas and vegetables. She has fifteen years of experience in farming. Lilian is seeking a loan to expand her horticulture farm. <br \/><br \/>She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output. Loans for smallholder farmers with little irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Lilian. <br \/><br \/>Through a group of 15 members called Kaibu, Lilian has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. <br \/><br \/>In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Lilian because the institution believes that women too can be actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":308.64,"image":{"id":1842028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To expand her horticultural farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-28T19:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-27T19:40:11Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.97,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.57,"local_amount":4415.5,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:34:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4466.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601512},{"amount":37.9,"local_amount":3445.76,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3485.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460011},{"amount":42.61,"local_amount":3891.64,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3936.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.2,"payment_id":681378447},{"amount":43.03,"local_amount":3956.75,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4002.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.49,"payment_id":696588109},{"amount":40.8,"local_amount":3864.25,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3908.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.71,"payment_id":711506420},{"amount":45.27,"local_amount":4199.71,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4247.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.93,"payment_id":731023242},{"amount":46.49,"local_amount":4284.64,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4333.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.64,"payment_id":752111401}],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T15:48:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Marie Phillips","image":1667620}},{"id":860088,"name":"Sonya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sonya lives in Vanadzor city of Lori region.

He shares his life with his wife, who works as an oral surgeon, and with his sons who are college graduates. They live in their own house that is built of cement and brick with a metal roof, and they have potable water, electricity, and gas.\r\n\r\nHis business is the manufacturing and sale of metal furniture, such as chairs, hangers\/racks, desks and other items. He works in his home for the shop and for the sales. He says, \"I started my business because I knew how to work with metal, then my sons helped me to manufacture and sell.\" The advantage of his business is that it is known because it is his own house and he has been in business for a long time, and the drawback is the competition. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to increase production in order to offer a greater amount and variety of furniture. He wants to purchase work materials such as metal tubing, wood, coverings, glue, welding electrodes, and other items used in his business. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in the 30 years that he has been in this business. For these reasons, Jhenry is requesting a loan to buy materials to make metal furniture and increase his production and offerings."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":529.39,"image":{"id":1842242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials to make metal furniture and increase his production and offerings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-28T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-27T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhenry Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-23T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-06T04:00:00Z","amount":356.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T04:00:00Z","amount":500.13},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T04:00:00Z","amount":503.27},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T04:00:00Z","amount":525.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T04:00:00Z","amount":555.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T04:00:00Z","amount":559.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T04:00:00Z","amount":614.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T04:00:00Z","amount":624.42},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T04:00:00Z","amount":647.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T04:00:00Z","amount":686.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T04:00:00Z","amount":710.43},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T04:00:00Z","amount":715.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.88},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.49},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.03},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.21,"local_amount":356.56,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:43Z","rounded_local_amount":358.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564572},{"amount":73.27,"local_amount":500.36,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":502.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046536},{"amount":73.65,"local_amount":503.04,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":505.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344356},{"amount":76.93,"local_amount":525.37,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":527.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554571},{"amount":81.37,"local_amount":555.68,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":558.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468672},{"amount":84.31,"local_amount":575.77,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:01Z","rounded_local_amount":578.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296527},{"amount":87.65,"local_amount":598.58,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:24Z","rounded_local_amount":601.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076755}],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T12:33:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Urry","image":1670999}},{"id":860141,"name":"Safya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Safya is a 51-year-old widow from a village near Ramallah City, West Bank, Palestine.

She has to advance her little savings in addition to this loan to buy the cattle. \r\n\r\nShrimati Bhuli, along with her group, has requested a loan of 36,000 INR from which Shrimati Bhuli's part will help her to buy a buffalo. Shrimati Bhuli is thankful to Kiva for this support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1841997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy a buffalo for milking","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Sonepur, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2015-03-28T21:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-27T21:40:07Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shrimati Bhuli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kamini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kamalini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":36000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T01:24:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":860243,"name":"Wilfredo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cAMANECER 15 DE AGOSTO\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Santa Ana, perteneciente a la provincia de La Convenci\u00f3n y departamento de Cusco.\n\nEl socio Wilfredo  se dedica al negocio de carpinteria, el socio hace trabajos como sillas, puertas y ventanas, el socio trabaja desde las 8.00 a.m hasta las 5:00 p.m,el socio ya tiene varios a\u00f1os en este negocio y el va muy bien, el sue\u00f1o del socio es ampliar el negocio de carpinteria.El socio solicita el cr\u00e9dito para comprar madera y herramientas.\n\nEl socio est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.\n","en":"This member belongs to the communal bank \u201cAmanecer 15 De Agosto.\u201d  The bank is located in the district of Santa Ana, belonging to the province of La Convencion and the department of Cusco.\r\n\r\nThe member Wilfredo works as a carpenter.

This is true for Sarah, who is based in the Siongiroi area of Kenya. She has been practicing mixed farming for the past 10 years. She has managed to earn a decent income. Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d \r\n\r\nSarah sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet the demand. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow; it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10-20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit margins and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. \r\n\r\nSarah is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling, and also to start selling dairy products such as yogurt.

He starts his work by casting the fishing nets at dusk and then collects them at dawn every day of the week. The most common varieties he catches are silverside, mauri (a small catfish), ispi (a tiny sardine-shaped fish), and trout, among others. \"I inherited the family business. I have my fishing boat, which needs maintenance,\" he says.\r\n\r\nHe has the advantage of having many years of experience, but the disadvantage is that there are seasons in which fishing cannot be done.  \r\n\r\nHis dream is to build a brick house. \r\n\r\nHe wants to buy a new fishing boat because the one he owns doesn't meet the minimum safety requirements for his work.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan cycle with the Institution in eight years that he has been following this occupation independently.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Moises is requesting a loan to purchase a fishing boat to do his job.
