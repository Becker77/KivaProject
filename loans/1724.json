Su vida la comparte con su esposo que trabaja como chofer y con sus hijos que estudian en la escuela, viven en una casa propia construida de adobe con techo de calamina que cuenta con agua de pozo energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y alcantarillado. La necesidad por ayudar con los gstos econ\u00f3micos a su familia la llevo a buscar una segunda actividad laboral y formar una banca de personas con negocios como; venta de productos de aseo personal, venta de verduras, venta de art\u00edculos de librer\u00eda, venta de comida, venta de desayunos, venta de ropa de segunda mano y transporte p\u00fablico como mototaxi, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y mejorar sus actividades.

Esta es la 4 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 5 a\u00f1os que viene desarrollando esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Herminia solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de un carrito para vender pollo frito por las noches y contar con 2 actividades.\n","en":"Herminia is a 33 year old woman. She is married and has 2 sons, aged 9 and 18. Her business is selling organic flax seed juice. She is a good mother, enterprising, independent, stable, has a good attitude, responsible and very hard working. She runs her business in the southern part of the city. It is an area characterized by informal businesses and manufacturing. It has a climate that varies during the day between 18-25 degrees celsius.\r\n\r\nHerminia has dark skin, long black hair that she wears braided, brown eyes, short stature, and a medium build. She dresses in traditional clothing  (hat, shawl and skirt), and her mother tongue is Quechua, which is spoken in the area. She speaks Spanish in the general culture and for business. She is the fifth in the line from the left. She is wearing a skirt with a cream colored sweater and a white and purple checked apron. She shares her life with her husband, who works as a driver, and with her children who go to school. They live in their own house built of Adobe with a metal sheeting roof it has water from an electric well and plumbing. The need to help with her family's household expenses led to her seeking a second work activity and to form a bank of people with businesses such as selling personal hygiene products, selling vegetables, selling bookstore items, selling food, selling breakfasts, selling second hand clothing, and public transportation such as a motorcycle taxi, so that they could ask for a loan and improve their activities. Her business is selling flax seed juice. Flax is a seed from the flax plant. her preparation method is putting the ground flaxseed in a container, adding 1 \u00bd cups of boiling water, and stirring it with a spoon. She adds lemon juice and lets it sit to add the sugar. Later she fills her thermos and sells it. She sells as a street vendor to merchants and vendors with sales stalls, who are her regular customers. \u201cI started my business out of the need to work. i know the market and its needs,\u201d she remarks. The advantage of the business is that she has regular customers. The disadvantage is the weather changes because she has to get around to find customers. Her dream is to open another business selling food to work in the evenings. She wants to buy a little cart to sell fried chicken. This is her 4th loan cycle with the institution in the 5 years that she has been doing this activity.  \r\n\r\nThese are the reasons that Herminia is asking for a loan to buy a little cart to sell fried chicken in the evenings and have 2 activities. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4025,"image":{"id":1842286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a little cart to sell fried chicken at night and have 2 activities.

She is 56 years of age, very hardworking and a go-getter. She hails from Ndalu, a remote village in the Kitale area of Kenya. This area has harsh weather conditions and to survive, you must have tough skin, but Esther has defied all the odds and has been engaged in farming for the past five years. Her primary sources of income are crops and animal farming. She also gets some income through personal business. Esther is contented with the farming way of life. \r\n\r\nEsther is a very enterprising woman, and although she never had formal employment, she has always worked hard on her farm and she has always assured her children and family of a decent meal. The Kitale area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why she is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Esther feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising women like her. Esther is well disciplined with finances and she plans that through the accumulated profits, she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children. Please help Esther so that her horticulture farming can

is 37 years old, married and a mother of 4 school-age and preschool-age children. She has a college education and works as a school principal. In search of a source of income for her family, Parizat started her own business in farming and animal husbandry in 2000. Thanks to Parizat's hard work, her farm currently contains 2 cows, 10 sheep and 2 horses. She grows clover and safflower on 1.18 hectares of land. Seeing additional income in agriculture, Parizat requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the Bai-Tushum Bank to buy a bull and to cultivate her land.

Her store specializes in folkloric dancing apparel and accessories, but she carries attire and accessories for all other major Mexican holidays. \r\n\r\nMs. Socorro began dancing folklorico at the age of 5 and has not stopped performing since then. Although folkloric dancing is less popular here than in her native Mexico, her passion for this dance transcends all borders. Her passion for this dance, the joy she experienced every time she performed and her desire to expose others to his beautiful tradition is what ultimately inspired her to open her own shop. Her products bring a cultural awareness to entire communities and to generations that were previously unattached or simply unaware of the beauty of folkloric dancing and other traditions; this is why she ultimately loves her job and what she does. \r\n\r\nAs a veteran folkloric dancer herself, she knew how difficult it was to not only find specific products she needed for the traditional Mexican dance, but also for those products to be of high quality. When she first began, her biggest challenge was finding these high-quality products at good prices, but as a connoisseur, she quickly identified which vendors would meet her high standards. Her biggest challenge now is finding the capital to purchase inventory to meet her growing demands. With Kiva funding, Ms. Soccoro will be able to obtain the inventory she needs to secure contracts with schools, recreational parks, and other organizations that will help her not only continue to fuel her passion, but also allow her business to keep growing.

","en":"Seyilkan is 61 years old, a widow and has grown and independent children. Just like many other families in rural areas, Seyilkan has been involved in fattening up livestock and in farming since 2000. Today, Seyilkan's farm contains 4 cows, 30 sheep and 1.20 hectares of land, where she grows potatoes. Her monthly profit amounts to about 8,000 som (KGS), but this money is not enough for a decent life. This is why, to continue expanding her business, Seyilkan requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the Bai-Tushum Bank to buy 3 calves and 10 sheep. Seyilkan plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing her livestock headcount and improving her family's welfare."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1455,"image":{"id":1840766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy 3 calves and 10 sheep in order to increase her income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Taldy - Bulak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-03-29T08:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-28T08:20:03Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.86,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Seyilkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":485},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":485},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":485},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":485},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":485}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":485,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:42:08Z","rounded_local_amount":30221.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649514224},{"amount":485,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:50:15Z","rounded_local_amount":30221.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995981},{"amount":462.14,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:05:41Z","rounded_local_amount":30221.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.86,"payment_id":752025872}],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T19:32:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":860384,"name":"Jonabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jonabel works hard to support her family.

She and her husband are raising three children.  Aizada has a secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities which constitute her family's main source of income.  She started in this field 16 years ago when she first bought livestock for 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has one cow and ten sheep on her farm.  She also grows beans on four hectares of land.  Aizada makes a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS).  In order to further grow her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy a heifer and increase her cattle headcount.  She is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further increase her number of domestic

Este es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 4 a\u00f1os que se dedica a esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Yoselin solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de ropa de beb\u00e9 por mayor para abrir una tienda y vender sus propios tejidos.\n","en":"23-year-old Yoselin lives with her husband and her 3-year-old son. She runs a business selling baby clothes. She is a good mother who is kind, friendly ever-smiling and who gets on well with her customers. She set up her business by selling her goods in the street in the '16 de julio' area, which is a strategic area with plenty of business, where you can see products made by small and medium-sized businesses. It represents the city's typical commercial and industrial production. It has a cold, dry climate with a daytime temperature which ranges between 0 and 16 degrees centigrade and it is at an altitude of 4,070 metres above sea-level. Yoselin has a dark complexion, long dark hair which she wears tied up, brown eyes and a small, slim frame. Her mother tongue is Aymara, which she speaks with her family, but she speaks Spanish outside the home and for her running her business. She shares her life with her husband (who works as a taxi driver) and her baby son. They live in the house which her husband owns. It is made of stone, with a corrugated meta roof, and has drinking water, electricity, gas and a sewerage system. She works selling clothing and baby products such as: bibs, tights, booties and other things. She sells her goods in the street as she does not have a shop. She goes to different fairs and markets in her city each day to sell her goods. \"I started my business selling sandals and I then noticed that baby clothes were more popular and so I changed\", she comments. The best thing about her business is that sales are consistently good because there are always plenty of babies. The worst thing is transport strikes, because she brings the clothing from another city and it is difficult to get around. Her dream is to open a baby clothes shop and to weave woollen clothing by machine. She wants to buy baby clothes wholesale to increase her stock, have a better range of goods to offer and boost her income. This is the 1st loan cycle for her business in her 4 years with the institution. This is why Yoselin is seeking a loan to buy baby clothes wholesale so she can buy a shop and sell her own textiles.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":571.59,"image":{"id":1842313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She married Leoncio with whom she had 5 children, of whom four are dependent on her. Her husband was a bricklayer but when he was working on building a house, he died over a year ago, leaving Teodocia responsible for their children. She had to work in all sorts of jobs such as growing flowers, working on farms, laundry, etc. but as her primary work, she raised pigs, but she has sold them since the food prices went up. Over a year ago, she began to work selling vegetables during the early mornings, where she resells to wholesalers. The loan that she is requesting is to purchase more merchandise and get more income to cover family expenses and school costs for her four children.

She is a good mother, enterprising, patient, committed to her work, responsible, and very hard-working. Her business is located in the \"Plan 3000\" zone, a place characterized by its productivity where there are microbusinesses in areas such as tailoring, design, and crafts, which imitate foreign products to sell them in the principal local markets. It is the most populated zone in the city, and has a warm tropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 18-35 degrees centigrade. \r\n\r\nLilian has dark skin, long dark hair she keeps tied up, dark hair, is short, has a robust physique, her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family and she speaks Spanish due to general culture and for the work she does (she is seated, second from the left, wearing a pink blouse and holding a black bag in her hands). She shares her life with her partner who works as a driver and with their children who are students. The youngest is still a baby and in her care. They live in their own house build of brick and cement with a roof of metal sheeting and which has drinking water, electricity, and sewer services. The need to supply her family with the indispensable basics brought her to establish a bank with people whose work is selling t-shirts, selling baby diapers, selling cosmetics from a catalog, selling eggs, selling women's shoes, selling ice cream, selling wallets. and selling costume jewelry, to ask for a loan and strengthen their businesses. Her business is selling traditional dishes such as majadito de charque (dried meat, rice, fried egg and fried plantain), chicharr\u00f3n de taitetu (fried wild pigs \"taitet\u00fa\"), sopa de man\u00ed (soup with a base of peanuts), locotos rellenos (peppers, chopped meat, onions) and more. She does this work for lunch time all the days of the week. Her second job is selling meat. She goes to the municipal butcher 2 times per week to purchase meat in bulk to sell it in her butcher shop.  Both jobs take all her time and cover a large part of the family expenses. \"I began my business selling meals due to having to cook for my family, which is large. Later I opened a butcher shop to stock my food business...\" she says. The advantage of her businesses is that they are complementary and both have constant customers. The disadvantage is the demand in the market. Her dream is to expand her butcher shop and open a large restaurant. She wants to purchase meat in bulk to sell in her butcher shop and also to cook at her food stall. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 1 year she has been doing this work. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons Lilian asks for a loan to purchase meat to sell in her butcher shop and also to cook and sell at her food stall.

Her business is located in the \"Plan 3000\" zone of the city, an area characterized by settlement of migrants such as Ayorea tribes native to the area and miners relocated from the west who took the place as their own and in the following generation began manufacturing and trade in all areas. It has a warm and very humid tropical climate, with a temperature that varies during the day between 18-35 degrees centigrade. \r\n\r\nYaquelin has dark skin, long black hair she keeps tied up, dark eyes, is short, has a thin physique, her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks with her family and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for the work she does (she is the second from the right, wearing a black tank top and blue pants, holding a girl in her arms). She has her life alongside her partner who works in construction, and their children. The three older ones go to school, the youngest is a baby. They live in their own room build of brick and cement with a roof of metal sheeting which has drinking water, electricity and sewer service. Her dream of improving herself and the need to feed her children brought her to form a bank of people with businesses such as making and selling woven wallets, selling blouses, selling empanadas, selling buttons, selling pork, selling telephone accessories, and a bakery, to ask for a loan and improve their businesses. Her business is selling soft drinks. It is 8 in the morning and she can be found at her sales point for the past half hour, she still continues selling soft drinks with ice. Her customers are people who pass by the place and at this time they begin to consume her products. Her business is protected from the sun with two umbrellas, one for the business and the other for the customers. She also has chairs around for the tired customers. She does this all outdoors and from Monday to Sunday because on the weekends there are fairs in the place and the people continue coming around. \"My business prospers continually because the customers are constant and the heat of the place makes them come for refreshment at any time...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she works without a break for the whole week and offers her customers a product that matches the climatic conditions. The disadvantage is that there is a lot of competition with alternative products such as juices and ice cream. Her dream is to have a complete store with soft drink sales and basic pantry items. She wants to purchase basic pantry items to open a neighborhood store and cover other needs.

Ni Nengah, who has a barn that measured two by 1.5 metres, can now enlarge it to four by 1.5 metres. She can sell her pigs to a big buyer and she can set aside money for saving and daily needs. \r\n\r\nDuring this last loan period, one group member resigned and was replaced by a new member. The Mutiara group has requested its third loan and intends to continue its business. For this loan, the group has asked for a larger amount. \r\n\r\nAfter having been evaluated by MUK, the group will receive an increased amount. This time, the group will manage pigs for pig barbeque, which can be sold every two months. \r\n\r\nNi Nengah will use her portion of the loan to purchase four local piglets and feed. She will also give the piglets traditional foods. \r\n\r\nShe plans to sell the pigs after two months and buy new piglets. The price for local pigs is more stable than for superior piglets at this time.

She is a native of another municipality where she grew up working in the coffee fields and cultivating staple grains from the time she was a child.

She works on Saturdays and Sundays in the town and neighboring communities. She travels into town twice monthly to buy the merchandise.  Also during the week Sara sells atol (drink made from corn), enchiladas, toast, cassava, bread and other snacks. The money she earns helps support her family.  Generally she works alone but sometimes her daughter helps her with sales in the community. Sara also sells underwear from catalog, and together with her husband, she works the land and raises livestock on a small scale.\r\n\r\nSara is requesting a loan to buy 2 heifers and to buy clothing for all ages.  She plans to continue to get good financial results for her family.  On the land where they have their home they have pasture grass, thanks to the fact that there is a source of water nearby.  With this loan, they will also buy cattle feed.\r\n\r\nSara dreams of buying more cattle to increase their stock.  This way, they could produce more milk and have more to sell to the community.

She is single and has three children ages 6, 9 and 12. Her business is the sale of empanadas. She is a good mother, an entrepreneur, patient, friendly, responsible and very hard-working. She runs her business in the area 'Plan 3000' which is known for the origin of its population, the Aymar\u00e1s, the Quechuas and the Guaran\u00edes that moved to the southern part of the city. Migrants from all over the country settled in this place and started a large trade. It has a warm tropical climate with a temperature that varies between 18 and 36 degrees Celsius during the day.\r\n\r\nNair has dark skin, long brown hair that she wears tied up, brown eyes, short in stature, and has a robust physique (she is on the right-hand side in the red shirt). Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish with the general public and in her business. She lives her life together with her children that are in school. They live in their own space made of brick and cement with a metal roof, and they have potable water, electricity, and gas. \r\n\r\nThe group's desires to get ahead have brought them to form a group of people to request a loan to strengthen their businesses. There are businesses such as selling baby clothes, selling leather purses, transportation services, selling vehicle batteries, selling food, a hardware store, selling breakfast foods, and selling second-hand clothing. \r\n\r\nNair's business is the sale of fried empanadas including: ham and cheese, cheese, shredded beef, pork, dulce de leche, sauteed meat, seafood, and mixed. The menu changes by day depending on the ingredients at the time. Her daily work consists of preparing and baking delicious empanadas to then sell as a street vendor in different markets and trades in the area. At night she is a manicurist. She works in a beauty salon taking care of the hands of her clients. She states, \"I work both jobs every day to make money for my children's expenses.\" The advantage of both jobs is that the schedules do not cross, and the downside is that she works every day of the week without rest.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to open a food stall and open a beauty salon. She would like to invest in both activities by buying flour and kitchen supplies like oil and other items at wholesale, and also buy a manicure set with nail clippers, cuticle cutters, nail polish remover, lotions, oils, and other items in order to push forward with both businesses and become independent. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in the four years that she has worked both jobs.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons Nair is requesting a loan to buy kitchen supplies for her empanada business and manicure material for her second job."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4375,"image":{"id":1842368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy kitchen supplies for her empanada business and manicure material for her second job.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-29T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-28T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":4375,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nair","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Walter Guillermo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edwin Navor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-24T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":2259.53},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T04:00:00Z","amount":2300.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T04:00:00Z","amount":2342.52},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T04:00:00Z","amount":2385.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T04:00:00Z","amount":2428.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T04:00:00Z","amount":2472.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T04:00:00Z","amount":2517.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T04:00:00Z","amount":2563.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T04:00:00Z","amount":2610.26},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T04:00:00Z","amount":2657.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T04:00:00Z","amount":2706.14},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T04:00:00Z","amount":2755.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":335.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.62},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":360.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":367.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":394.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":401.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1354.48,"local_amount":9288.15,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":9292.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564577},{"amount":714.78,"local_amount":4901.49,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4903.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046541},{"amount":1121.69,"local_amount":7691.85,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":7695.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344361},{"amount":782.24,"local_amount":5364.07,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":5366.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554576},{"amount":401.81,"local_amount":2754.44,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2755.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468677}],"funded_date":"2015-04-14T13:56:50Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Urry","image":1670999}},{"id":860508,"name":"Maria Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria Victoria is a 47-year-old married woman and a mother of two children from Ormoc City, Leyte.

She resides in the Kitale area of Kenya. She has seven lovely and adorable children whom she really values and treasures. She always refers to them as \"her heartbeat.\" \r\n\r\nJane has been farming for the past 25 years and through hard work and determination, she has been able to support her family and always provide a plate of food for them. Her main sources of income come from milk, poultry, crops and a small personal business that she does to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nDue to harsh living conditions and the lack of employment, Jane plans to increase her farming output so that she can improve her income and, hence, her living conditions. That is why she is seeking a loan of 55,000 KES to buy farm inputs.

She is 40 years old, married, and from this relationship they have three children who are 22, 21 and 12 years of age.  The youngest is studying in school.  Two of her children live with her.  Her husband is an attendant on a transport bus.\r\n\r\nOn seeing that her husband didn't earn much and the money didn't stretch to pay the expenses, 5 years ago Martha started a small convenience store in her house.  There she began just selling products such as rice, sugar, oil, and detergents among other primary provisions.  Later, with the help of loans, she has added a variety of products.  She also sells natural products, sales that she realizes at her store or by going out into the town. \r\n\r\nIn this way she gets her own income that she uses for her son's studies since she hopes that he will be a great professional.\r\n\r\nThis loan is going to be used to further supply her store.  She is going to buy rice, sugar, oil, detergents and natural products.  She has had 5 loan cycles with the \u201cGrupo Credito\u201d and she likes it because with the loans she has improved her business.  Her goal is to continue adding more to her store every day.

To avoid feeling the emptiness and to keep her mind on something productive, she asked for her first loan which she invested in cosmetics. \r\n\r\nTwo years later, after observing that not only she but other people in the community are frequently left without gas and that the distance to the nearest gas station was not very encouraging, she decided to begin to sell gas. \r\n\r\nToday, Lul\u00fa has both jobs. With her earnings she has done remodeling to her house, she reinvests in both businesses and also supports one of her daughters and her granddaughter who came back to live with her. This time, she needs the loan to purchase more lipstick, eye shadow, eye liner, mascara, creams, and diesel. Lul\u00fa would like to be able to raise pigs to sell in the nearby communities to have extra income. \r\n\r\nThe members of \"Las Bugambilias\", especially Lul\u00fa are grateful to each and every one of the people who have contributed to their loans. \r\n\r\n*The photo was taken in the municipal park where the members life.

But one of the difficulties he has is that he doesn't have enough capital to pay the land rent and buy his chemical fertilizer.\r\n\r\nEdgar's greatest dream is to be able to farm this year to increase his income and be able to buy a piece of land where he can grow crops, so he can continue helping his children in school.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":187.15,"image":{"id":1842512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy chemical fertilizer and to pay land rent","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2015-03-29T22:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-28T22:00:09Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar Benjamin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.64,"local_amount":176.03,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:08:42Z","rounded_local_amount":187.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649489759},{"amount":25.05,"local_amount":178.94,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":191.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664972195},{"amount":25.82,"local_amount":184.41,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":196.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681267742},{"amount":27.15,"local_amount":193.92,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":207.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696477548},{"amount":27.19,"local_amount":194.24,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:19:06Z","rounded_local_amount":207.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711385195},{"amount":27.62,"local_amount":197.27,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:16:20Z","rounded_local_amount":210.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731215294},{"amount":29.68,"local_amount":212.02,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":226.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752000794}],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T13:58:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Frank","image":null}},{"id":860422,"name":"Mujeres Emprendedoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo llamado Mujeres Emprendedoras est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero 4 del programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres.

She has a 4 year-old son, and two daughters aged 10 and 7.  She has a business selling natural juices.  She is a good mother who is sensitive, sincere, understanding, patient, a good listener, responsible, and very hardworking.  She is developing her business in the \"Tilata\" area, an urban residential area located on the high plateau at 4,100 meters above sea level.  This place has a cold and dry climate with a daytime temperature that varies between 1 and 12 centigrade.  \r\n\r\nJesusa has a dark complexion, long black hair that she wears pulled back, dark eyes, a short stature, and robust physique.  She dresses traditionally (wearing a hat, a shawl and a skirt).  Her native language is Aymara, which she speaks in her hometown.  She also speaks Spanish in everyday life and in her business.  She shares her life with her children.  Her two oldest daughters attend school, and the youngest is not yet school-aged and lives with his grandmother.   They live in their own home built of bricks and cement, with a tin roof.  The house has electricity, is connected to a sewer system, and has clean drinking water.  \r\n\r\nJesusa has a business selling natural juice beverages such as blended drinks made of banana, apple, kiwi, strawberries, papaya, and other fruits, made with or without milk.  She also makes traditional juices such as the \"batido,\" which is a blended drink made from egg whites with sugar and dark beer.  This is very popular because of its restorative qualities.  She also sells carrot juice.  She operates her business from an outdoor stand during the daytime hours from Monday through Saturday.\r\n\r\n \"Ever since I was very young I worked applying stucco.  Three years ago I started working independently with my juice business, and I work alone,\"  she comments.  The advantage of her business is that there is no competition in the area.  The disadvantage is that she must travel by foot long distances, carrying all of the fruit to her sales post.  Her dream is to expand her business with new machines and cooking utensils.

She is from Nandihills, a remote village in the famous Rift valley. She is happily married and is blessed with three adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last two years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Nandihills area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 50,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved, knowing that her dream will be achieved, and that she will be able to buy more poultry. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level.

who have broken major world records. She is a mother of two and has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. On her farm, she grows maize and keeps dairy cows and poultry. She sells milk, eggs, and maize. To meet her expenses and provide the best for her parents, she often engages in small personal businesses to make extra money. But farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction despite meager earnings. <br \/><br \/>\"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs,\" said Milkah. Her biggest challenge is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. To a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Milkah formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports small rural farmers. <br \/><br \/>Magdaline is seeking a loan to buy a dairy cow and is planning to become a fully-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. With this loan, Milkah is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, good health, and a good livelihood."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":199.93,"image":{"id":1843343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-30T01:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-29T01:00:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.65,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milkah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":31050,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2197.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2261.73},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2327.82},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2395.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2465.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2537.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2612.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2688.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2767.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2847.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2931.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3016.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.68,"local_amount":2988.26,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3094.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601523},{"amount":27.13,"local_amount":2407.24,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2492.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460019},{"amount":28.59,"local_amount":2550.21,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2640.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.16,"payment_id":681378461},{"amount":23.9,"local_amount":2147.04,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2223.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.3,"payment_id":696588124},{"amount":26.91,"local_amount":2489.6,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2577.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.15,"payment_id":711506433},{"amount":28.57,"local_amount":2588.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2680.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.61,"payment_id":731023257},{"amount":28.5,"local_amount":2566.87,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2657.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.43,"payment_id":752111417}],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T09:19:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":860691,"name":"Rosalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Rosalia, 39 years old and resident of Pasay City, Philippines.

Her business is the production and sale of handmade cheese.  She is enterprising, patient, a good listener, optimistic, responsible, and hard-working.  Her business is carried out in the town of Karhuiza, which is situated at an altitude of 3,735 meters above sea level and at a distance of 65 kilometers, or one hour, from the city.  Its inhabitants are originally from Aymara families.  The main economic activity of the population is raising cattle to better produce milk and its by-products, as well as continuing agricultural production like growing potatoes, beans, and quinoa.\r\n\r\nRuperta has brown skin, dark eyes, a short stature, and long dark hair that she wears in a braid.  She has a medium physique, and her way of dressing is traditional (sombrero, poncho, and skirt).  Ruperta's native language is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks at home, but she speaks Spanish in everyday life and for her work.  She carries out her life in the company of her husband who makes a living with livestock.  They live in their own home which is made of brick and has a corrugated roof and electricity.  They get water from a nearby reservoir, and do not have a sewage system.  \r\n\r\nRuperta's business is making handmade cheese.  She dedicates herself every day to caring for the cows in order to get the milk and produce cheese. \"My business continues to grow.  The demand is greater and I need to produce a larger quantity of milk...\", she says.  One perk of her business is that she has a lifetime of experience in producing cheese, and this means that she has constant customers.  A drawback is the weather of the place, which makes milk production difficult.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a large barn that provides all the amenities for milk production, and she wishes to purchase dairy cattle to raise.  This is her second cycle of loans with the institution in the 16 years that she has has this job.

mantiene su esp\u00edritu trabajador. A sus 63 a\u00f1os a\u00fan est\u00e1 involucrada en la actividad que aprendi\u00f3 de su esposo Manuel y que a ambos les permiti\u00f3 sacar adelante a sus cuatro hijos, todos ellos independientes hoy en d\u00eda. \nLa pareja y dos de sus hijos se dedican a recolectar papel y cart\u00f3n de desperdicio en grandes cantidades para producir l\u00e1minas de cart\u00f3n que revenden en la comunidad. Para obtener su producto necesitan remojar todo el material, moler la pasta y despu\u00e9s hacen placas de 2x2 metros que dejan secar. Por \u00faltimo, las placas se petrolizan para garantizar mayor durabilidad, se empaquetan y est\u00e1n listas para vender. \nHace 13 a\u00f1os Manuel aprendi\u00f3 a hacer las l\u00e1minas en una f\u00e1brica de cart\u00f3n y despu\u00e9s de conocer bien el proceso, se aventur\u00f3 a trabajar de manera independiente. El apoyo e inter\u00e9s de Do\u00f1a Juana por aprender, los llev\u00f3 a tener un negocio estable. A pesar de que las actividades de Juana han disminuido, ella sigue tendiendo una mano a Don Manuel. \u201cRealmente me agrada estar dentro del taller ayudando en lo que pueda, me gusta ver todo el proceso y las l\u00e1minas al final\u201d. \nEl microcr\u00e9dito les ha ayudado a comprar la maquinaria y el material necesarios para mejorar su negocio: han comprado combust\u00f3leo, cart\u00f3n cuando les hace falta, m\u00e1quinas e incluso una camioneta para transportar su producto. \nComo siguiente paso, la familia tiene planeado buscar nuevos mercados, vender las l\u00e1minas de cart\u00f3n en otras comunidades a las que hasta ahora no han llegado. Para lograr su meta, necesitan seguir contando con apoyo financiero y esta vez solicitan un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar m\u00e1s combust\u00f3leo necesario para el acabado de sus l\u00e1minas.  \n*En la imagen: Don Juan, Do\u00f1a Juana y una de sus hijas quien les ayuda en la producci\u00f3n de las l\u00e1minas de cart\u00f3n.

At 63, she is still involved in the activity she learned from her husband, Manuel, which allowed both of them to raise their four children, who are all independent now.\r\n\r\nThe couple and two of their children collect paper and cardboard from refuse in large quantities to produce cardboard sheets to re-sell in the community.  To make their product, they need to steep all the material in water, mix the resulting pulp, and later they press it into 2x2 meter sheets, and then let them dry.  Finally, they coat the sheets with paraffin to ensure durability, pack them, and then they are ready to sell.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago, Manuel learned to make the sheets in a cardboard factory, and after becoming very familiar with the process, he ventured to work independently.  Juana\u2019s support and interest in learning, led them to have a stable business.  Despite the fact that Juana\u2019s activities have diminished, she continues lending a hand to Manuel.  \u201cActually, I really enjoy being in the workshop helping wherever I can. I like to see the whole process and the finished sheets\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe loan has helped them to purchase the machinery and the material needed to improve their business.  They have purchased paraffin, cardboard when they need it, machines, and even a small truck to transport their product.\r\n\r\nAs a next step, the family plans to seek new markets, and sell the cardboard sheets in other communities that they have not reached so far.  To achieve their goal, they need to continue to have financial support, and this time they are requesting a loan to purchase more paraffin, which they need to finish their sheets.\r\n\r\n*In the image, are Juan, Juana, and one of their daughters who is helping them in the production of the cardboard sheets. The three members of the group are posing at the fountain, which is the focal point of the town garden where they live.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":1716312,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to
