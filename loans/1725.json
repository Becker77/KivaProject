She started farming 7 years ago as a means of growing food and earning income for her family. The business has grown from nothing to having 2 pigs, 3 sheep, 4 dairy cows, and 5 head of poultry. Betty also grows crops for food, for feed, and for sale. With all these sources of income, one of Betty's major challenges is transportation of the produce to market. \r\n\r\nBetty is seeking a loan to buy a motorcycle. With your help, the motorcycle will provide a cheap, versatile, and convenient solution to the transportation problem Betty is facing. A motorcycle is ideal for transportation of passengers and goods over short distances, and on rural roads impassable by cars. The motorcycle will also enable Betty to reach further markets and widen her network of clients.\r\n \r\nReturns from this investment will be used to settle debt consolidated in monthly instalments. Additional income from this investment will help Betty grow her business, and improve the lives of her family and people around her.

Her two daughters are married and live separately.\r\n\r\nYelena and her husband are farmers with many years of experience. They keep sheep, calves and hens, and they also cultivate wheat, potatoes and garlic.\r\n\r\nAs Yelena's children grew up, the family needed more and more resources to make ends meet. All of their available resources were used for family living expenses, so nothing remained to invest in a farm.

Her business involves selling eggs in bulk.  Juana is a good mother who is enterprising, independent, steadfast, responsible, and hardworking.  She conducts her business at the Urkupi\u00f1a fair, which is one the most popular in the city since hundreds of merchants from all areas gather there to offer their products.  The weather in this area is cold and dry, with a temperature that varies throughout the day between 0 and 12 degree Celsius.  <br \/><br \/>Juana has long black braided hair, brown eyes, a short stature, and a thin physique.  She wears traditional garments (hat, shawl, and skirt).  Her native language is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks with her family, but she also speaks Spanish as part of the general culture and to carry out her business.  She shares her life with her partner, who works in transportation, and their son who is just starting school.  They live in a brick and cement house with a metal sheet roof.  Their home receives running water, electricity, and sewage service.  Her business involves selling eggs in bulk.  Juana buys the eggs from poultry companies and then delivers them to different businesses such as bakeries, neighborhood stores, restaurants, markets, and other establishments.  She operates her business all day, Monday through Saturday.  \u201cAll most everyone uses eggs, so I have established regular customers,\u201d says Juana.  Her advantage is that her partner is able to help with running the business.  However, her disadvantage is that she does not have a vehicle of her own for delivering her product.  Her dream is to open a poultry farm.  She wants to buy eggs in bulk so that she can distribute them to new customers.  This is her first loan cycle with Emprender.  Juana has been operating her business for one year.  <br \/><br \/>For the reasons previously mentioned, Juana is requesting a loan in order to buy eggs in bulk so that she can distribute them to her new customers.

Medera has a high school education and she does farm work as the main source of income for her family.  She started this business in 2010 with 15,000 som (KGS) and her farm has one cow and ten sheep, as well as a .5-hectare rented plot of land on which she grows barley for resale.  Medera also sells milk and dairy products and she earns extra money by selling consumer goods.  All of her products are in high demand and they bring her an income of about 15,000 som (KGS) per month.  Her family will take on any job, as their income is not enough for their living expenses, which is why Medera has turned to Bai Tushum bank with the goal of developing her business further.  She is asking for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to increase her turnover of goods.  She plans to reinvest the income from the loan back into her business, and she also wants to save up money to make repairs on her shop in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":517.84,"image":{"id":1840868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to increase the turnover of clothes in her shop in order to attract new clients and increase her income ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Birinchi-May village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-03-30T03:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-29T03:40:07Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.38,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Medera","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3540},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3643},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3749},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3859},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3971},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4087},{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4206},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4329},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4455},{"due_date":"2015-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4585},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4719},{"due_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4857}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.41},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.65},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.86},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":118.52,"local_amount":7183,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":7385.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649514243},{"amount":61.86,"local_amount":3749,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3854.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664996004},{"amount":63.67,"local_amount":3859,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3967.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291415},{"amount":65.52,"local_amount":3971,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4082.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500668},{"amount":67.44,"local_amount":4087,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4202.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711411599},{"amount":69.38,"local_amount":4206,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4324.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.02,"payment_id":730933817},{"amount":68.07,"local_amount":4329,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4450.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.36,"payment_id":752025889}],"funded_date":"2015-04-02T17:55:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":860700,"name":"Naziran's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naziran is a 41-year-old woman.

Meet Beatrice, a mother from Litein, a remote village town in the Rift Valley province of Kenya. She has spent the past 10 years of her life farming. She sells milk and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in personal business to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nBeatrice is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. Of all the activities in which she involves herself, dairy farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and milk her cows and feed them with fodder that has a high nutrient value. She is so keen and close with her cows that she has named them. Milking her cows makes Beatrice very proud, and she feels fulfilled. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is a very profitable business venture, and Beatrice wants to take full advantage of it. She would like to expand her dairy business, but the biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital to grow her business. She is requesting a loan, which she will use to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. Beatrice has planted Napier grass, and feeding the cows will never be a challenge. She also owns an expansive piece of land, and the excess space will be productively used when she acquires the additional dairy cow. The exotic cow she will buy will produce between 10 and 15 litres of milk per day, which will translate to more income and profits. The profits from milk sales will allow Beatrice to grow her business further. She will start to package milk and to process it into dairy products such as cream, yoghurt, and cheese.

With the little time Hellen has, she sells crops from their small farm and also keeps dairy cows and poultry. From Kiva lenders, Hellen is seeking a loan worth 30,000 KES to grow her horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to give Hellen access to a loan that will aid her in growing her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increasing employment opportunities, and bringing about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Hellen\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income

There is more need, now than before, for services like these as customers\u2019 demand increases. Her main patrons are students, who require her services for school requirements. She also has people who need to rent computers for business purposes like writing a resume or any office documentation, as well as people who would just love to surf the net and any social networks. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in profit every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy an additional Piso Net unit for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nLilibeth desires to open another computer shop so she can extend more her service within the community. She hopes to give her family, especially her children, a good life in the future. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

His business is to change and sells motor oil and lubricants. He is enterprising, decisive, independent, responsible and very hardworking. His business is in the area of \u2018Pampahasi\u2019, an area characterized by being on the Eastern slope of the city, with very steep streets on cliffs. The origin of its inhabitants is that they are Aymara peasants who fought against the Spanish crown and settled in this place as a trench. It is cold and dry with temperatures varying from 2-14 degrees Celsius during the whole year. Luis is of dark skin, short black curly hair, short in height, thin. His native language is Aymara which he speaks with his family, and he speaks Spanish as general culture and for his job. He lives with his parents in their own house, built with brick and cement, with corrugated iron roof, drinking water, electricity, domestic gas and sewerage. His business is to change motor oil and lubricants to vehicles such as: motorcycles, cars, station wagons, trucks, etc. He works the whole day from Monday to Saturday. In the evenings, he attends a well known institute and studies the career of car mechanics. \"I started this business on my mother's advice, because my family worked in this business previously...\", he comments. The advantage of this business is that the car park is ample on the slope where his business is located. The disadvantage is that it takes a lot of time from his studies in car mechanics. His dream is to be a professional and open a mechanics shop. He wants to buy motor oil and lubricants to sell in his business and finish with his studies. This is his first loan cycle with the institution in the two years he has been working independently. This is why Luis is requesting a loan to buy motor oil and lubricants for vehicles, to work in his business and to finish his studies. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":383.88,"image":{"id":1842211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy motor oil and lubricants to work in his business, and to finish his studies.

Adi lives in Sukabumi, a city located at the foot of Mount Gede in West Java, about 80 km (50 mi) from the national capital of Indonesia, Jakarta. He lives there with his wife and his children (one son and one daughter). Adi owns a stall that sells mobile phone accessories, mobile airtime credits and provides bill payment services to the community. He decided to join Ruma because he wanted to learn about how to expand his business using technology. Together with his wife, he realized that they need to save more money for their children\u2019s education.  Adi is a friendly and informative mobile provider; that\u2019s why he has many customers.\r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Adi needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits and provide more bill payment services to his community. Adi\u2019s goal with Ruma is to serve as an e-commerce business for his community in the near future with Ruma\u2019s latest product called Mapan. As seen in the photo, Adi is the one who is holding Ruma\u2019s banner.

She is married and has two sons, aged 23 and 25. She owns a small store where she sells food and essential products.\r\n\r\nJulia is a good mother. She is understanding, patient, supportive, optimistic, responsible, hardworking, and a good listener. Her business is located in Sacaba, which is located 14 km [9 miles] from the city [Cochabamba]. Farmers who work in the countryside stay in their houses in the city when they come to sell their produce. The city has mild weather, with a temperature that ranges between 6 and 7 \u00b0C [43 to 63 \u00b0F].\r\n\r\nJulia has a dark complexion. Her hair is dark brown and tied up, and she has brown eyes. She is short, and in good shape. Her mother tongue is Quechua, which is spoken by locals. She also speaks Spanish due to cultural and professional reasons (she is the first one from right to left and is wearing a pink blouse). She shares her life with her husband, who is a businessman, and her children, who study and work. They own a brick house with metal roof, where they live. It is served with electricity and they take their water from a well.\r\n\r\nJulia needs to expand her business and increase her income in order to help to cover the home expenses. This is why she started a group with people that work selling milk, lamb meat, hygiene products, blouses, fruits and chicken, or repairing tires, to request a loan and improve her activity. She sells food and essential products such as bread, sugar, noodles, rice, vegetable oil, cookies, beverages, etc., in a grocery store she has at home. She works every day during regular working hours.\r\n\r\nJulia wants to expand her business by buying a fast food cart to sell hamburgers, salchipapa (a mix of sausages and French fries), and other things. She wants to do this at night, because no one else has this kind of business. \u201cI work during daytime selling to my customers, who tell me that I should sell fast food at night,\u201d she says.

The conversations that they have with each other are completely in their mother tongue but they also speak in Spanish.\r\n\r\nAdelina, 67, continues to be a very active and happy woman, mother to seven children who are all adults. Since she was young, she was involved in the countryside and animals since her parents were peasants so when she started a family and decided to help with the family expenses she knew that it was her time to put into practice everything she had learned.\r\n\r\nWith her savings, she bought some lambs to take care of and sell after some months. Adelina continued with this work for a little more than twenty years. During this time, she was also dedicated to making Mazahua crafts, which is the business she still manages. She uses the loan to buy raw material like checkered table cloth, yarn, different colored thread and needles. The pieces that she creates are napkins, table cloths, hooks, drawing flowers and animals in color on the fabric, a part of the Mazahua iconography.\r\n\r\nAdelina is thankful for the loans she has received and that allow her to have income to build her own house and get her children ahead. Her only goal now is to keep embroidering so she has her own income and can pay her bills.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Leticia and Diana who also will invest in embroidery; Juana, Juliana and Hilaria will invest in sheep.\r\n\r\n*The photo was taken in the town park. Adelina, Juana and Hilaria appear with their typical costime. Adelina is wearing the purple nahua.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5375,"image":{"id":1842278,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw material like checkered table cloth, yarn, different colored thread and needles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Nicolas Guadalupe, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-03-30T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-29T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":5375,"lender_count":204,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana Carla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":671.88},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":671.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":671.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":671.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":671.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":671.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":671.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":671.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2015.63,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":30121.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769295},{"amount":1343.75,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":20081.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649764060},{"amount":1343.75,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:25:41Z","rounded_local_amount":20081.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597584},{"amount":671.87,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:20:17Z","rounded_local_amount":10040.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682140975}],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T17:15:14Z","paid_date":"2015-07-19T12:20:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":861052,"name":"Pacita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pacita is 57 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

That's why she has organized a group of women to request a loan that she will invest in the purchase of onions, potatoes, green beans, and carrots to later sell.\r\n\r\nHer greatest desire is to be able to buy a lot where she could build her house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1844258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to buy and sell onions, potatoes, green beans, and carrots.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2015-03-30T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-29T17:00:07Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leocadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":6500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":541.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.96,"local_amount":542,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":557.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649489767},{"amount":72.96,"local_amount":542,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":557.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664972203},{"amount":73.74,"local_amount":547.81,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":563,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681267750},{"amount":72.72,"local_amount":540.2,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:15:37Z","rounded_local_amount":555.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696477554},{"amount":72.94,"local_amount":541.85,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:19:09Z","rounded_local_amount":556.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711385202},{"amount":509.68,"local_amount":3786.14,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3891.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731215302}],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T20:06:16Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T12:16:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":861128,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma, age 23, owns and operates a small food shop to earn her living.

These \"Chullpas\" can be seen from the trail. \r\n\r\nThe weather in this area is cold and dry, the temperature varies during the day between 2 and 16 degrees Centigrade.\r\n\r\nEva has dark complexion, her hair is black and long, and she braids it. Her eyes are brown, she is short and thin. Her fist language is Aymara, spoken in the region, and she also speaks Spanish because it is common and also she uses it to do business.\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her husband, whose occupation is the same, and also with her daughters, who attend school. They rent a house made out of adobe with a corrugated iron roof. The house has electricity and water from a well. There is no a sewage system  in that area.\r\n\r\nShe makes stucco, and this consist on the treatment of stone (plaster) in its natural state. Turning it into dust to mix with water and to put it on surfaces such as walls, ceilings, cement, and construction coating finish. \" We started helping my father, then we inherited this quarry to work...\" she states.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to build a brick house. She wishes to buy a motor to produce stucco. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in 4 years that she has been working. This is why Eva is requesting a loan, to buy a motor to make stucco to produce wholesale.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1847980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy a motor to make stucco to produce wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-30T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-29T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-13T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-07T04:00:00Z","amount":904.89},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T04:00:00Z","amount":845.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T04:00:00Z","amount":882.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T04:00:00Z","amount":931.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T04:00:00Z","amount":971.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T04:00:00Z","amount":1004.94},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T04:00:00Z","amount":1049.07},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T04:00:00Z","amount":1090.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T04:00:00Z","amount":1149.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T04:00:00Z","amount":1169.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.21},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.98},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.85},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":253.8,"local_amount":1750.35,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1751.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564546},{"amount":127.98,"local_amount":882.59,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:14Z","rounded_local_amount":883.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046510},{"amount":1068.22,"local_amount":7367.06,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":7370.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344330}],"funded_date":"2015-04-12T18:13:09Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"maria c carbonero","image":null}},{"id":858313,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy grains (corn, millet).","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2015-03-30T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-29T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T02:05:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett Ray","image":null}},{"id":861140,"name":"Gina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gina has a collection of ornamental garden plants.

","en":"Myriam is 64 years old. She works making uniforms in a small sewing shop set up in her home. After completing her training and learning the art of dressmaking eleven years ago, she decided to apply her new skills to generate an income and started out little by little, providing services to her customers. They would bring all the material and supplies to her shop for her to design and produce each clothing item, conforming to the style they wanted and the particular measurements of each customer.\r\n\r\nToday, her main clothing line is uniforms and her customer base comprises young students and her community of neighbors in general, who increasingly demand high quality. This has become her main challenge. She is currently requesting a Kiva loan, which she will use to buy an overlock sewing machine. This will allow her to add a better finishing to her clothing items.

She has a college degree and teaches Kyrgyz language and literature at the local school. She supplements her salary by farming and raising livestock. Mira started her farm 25 years ago with 10,000 som (KGS). Her hard work allowed the farm to grow, and now Mira owns 4 cows and 20 sheep. She also farms 4 hectares of rented land, where she grows rice and sunflowers. She sells the harvest to wholesale buyers. Her monthly farm income is 10,000 som (KGS). In order to expand her farm, Mira has turned to \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS), which she will use to purchase rice seeds, fertilizer and prepare for spring planting.

He performs his business in the \u2018Pampahasi\u2019 Zone, characterized by being situated above the eastern mountainside of the city, whose streets have very steep slopes. The origins of its inhabitants are Aymara farmers that fought for liberation from the Spanish crown, and settled in that place that is like a trench. It has a cold and dry climate with a daily temperature that varies between 2-14 degrees centigrade during the whole year.\r\n\r\nAlvaro has dark skin, short black hair, brown eyes, short stature, and a thin build. His mother tongue is Aymara, which he speaks with his family, and Spanish, through the general culture and the business that he realizes. He lives his life in his parents\u2019 home which is their own and is constructed of brick and cement, with a corrugated iron roof. It has potable water, electricity, gas, and a sewage system. \r\n\r\nHe is studying graphic design. He finds himself in his first year of studies and his main aptitudes are creativity, imagination, free thinking, he knows how to draw, he is authentic, and he visualizes the image in his mind and then projects it onto paper. He is preparing to work in the free exercise of the graphic design profession or to provide advisory and visual communication project development services, forming a part of multidisciplinary groups in different public or private business in the area of communications or that are based on it, providing graphic communications solutions. \r\n\r\nParallel to his studies, his business is maintaining computers on-site. He is responsible for repairing and configuring computers for businesses and private customers. He performs both of these activities during the week. \u201cI work and study. Both activities help me in my personal development...\u201d he comments. The advantage of his business is that it is not tiring and it covers his personal expenses. The disadvantage is that it is free and sometimes it overlaps his class schedule. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to come out a professional and work in the media. He wishes to purchase a laptop and pay his university fees in advance to get a discount. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in less than 1 year of studying and working.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Alvaro is requesting a loan to purchase a laptop and pay the class fees in advance to receive a discount.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":407.04,"image":{"id":1844238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to purchase a laptop and to pay the fees for his classes in advance to receive a discount.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-30T17:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-29T17:40:05Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alvaro Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-26T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-06T04:00:00Z","amount":49.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T04:00:00Z","amount":53.79},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":60.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":60.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":62.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":65.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T04:00:00Z","amount":66.4},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T04:00:00Z","amount":66.86},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":69.13},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":70.91},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T04:00:00Z","amount":71.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T04:00:00Z","amount":73.73},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":74.77},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T04:00:00Z","amount":76.35},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":78.07},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T04:00:00Z","amount":79.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.03},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.6},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.4},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.86},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.13},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.91},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.38},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.73},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.77},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.35},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.07},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.33,"local_amount":49.33,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:48Z","rounded_local_amount":49.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564586},{"amount":53.79,"local_amount":53.79,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":53.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046550},{"amount":58.82,"local_amount":58.82,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":58.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344370},{"amount":60.03,"local_amount":60.03,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":60.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554585},{"amount":60.59,"local_amount":60.59,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":60.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468686},{"amount":61.88,"local_amount":61.88,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":61.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296538},{"amount":62.6,"local_amount":62.6,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":62.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076763}],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T22:04:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Tyler","image":null}},{"id":861139,"name":"Fe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fe, age 44, operates a tire shop to earn an income.

Aigul has a high school degree and supplements that family's income by farming and raIsing livestock. She started 17 years ago by purchasing livestock with 50,000 som (KGS). Due to her persistence and hard work she now owns 3 cows and 20 sheep. She also grows beans on 4 hectares of land.

In his community he is very respected because of being a representative, but he is also well liked and trusted. Better known as Max, he is 58 years old and has 8 children, although only two of them are still dependent of him financially. Some years ago, Max had to leave his family to travel to the United States looking for better job opportunities, but his intention was to improve the quality of life of his family. He stayed abroad for many years until his wife got sick and he returned to his town. Fortunately, his wife recovered, and currently she keeps on supporting her husband in the business. After noticing there was no hardware store in his town, Max invested his savings and started his own business. His hardware store has been open for four years, and he keeps on having good earnings. VisionFund's loans have allowed him to stock up with tools such as screwdrivers, pliers, screws, hammers, flowerpots, shovels, hoes and wheelbarrows, among other things. \r\n\u201cHaving my business next to the highway at a stable place which also belongs to me helps me a lot\", commented Max enthusiastically.

Teresia practises mixed farming, which offers her multiple sources of income. <br \/><br \/>Teresia is seeking a loan to purchase a water pump. Her one acre farm is comprised of two dairy cows, three sheep, thirty heads of poultry, a variety of crops and twenty trees--all of which need water to thrive. The problems she is facing due to the remoteness of her home is lack of electricity, lack of clean cooking fuel and lack of a tap water system. As a result, she resorts to the use of solar-powered devices, firewood and a water well. <br \/><br \/>With your loan investment, Teresia will be able to pump water in huge volumes from the well in a much easier and much faster manner compared to the method of fetching buckets. The water pump will also clear the way for the introduction of irrigation technology in the future when she is ready to invest in that technique. The impact of your loan will be evident in the greener crops and healthier animals henceforth. Improving Teresia's farm business will definitely bring a positive change in her family life as well."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":272.38,"image":{"id":1844831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a water pump","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ndaragwa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-30T18:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-29T18:00:07Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.28,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.74},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6315.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.25,"local_amount":9849.8,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":10092.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.61,"payment_id":681378475},{"amount":155.85,"local_amount":14571.17,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:51Z","rounded_local_amount":14929.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.67,"payment_id":711506447}],"funded_date":"2015-03-30T23:13:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":861172,"name":"Vilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Vilma works hard to support her family.

Elena manages a buy-and-sell business, and her income from the business is helping with their everyday needs and expenses.<br \/><br \/>What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and then sell them piecemeal with a little profit. Products can range from ready-to-wear clothing and bags to other similar products. She also sells peanuts and 'pastillas' (a sweet and sugary dessert that is well known and loved by many people in the Philippines) and other goods. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day.<br \/><br \/>Elena is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan to purchase more products and merchandise to sell. She will use her loan to improve her sales and her additional revenue to improve the general living conditions of her family.<br \/><br \/>In the future, she hopes to prosper through her business and give her children a good life. She meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is therefore seeking a loan in the amount of Kes 60,000 in order to implement zero-grazing technique on her dairy farm. With her loan funds, she is planning to build a crop inventory so that she can store feed for the cows' daily consumption. She will also invest in making water available 24\/7 so that the animals can continually hydrate. \r\n\r\nThis investment is a game-changer for Nancy's business and will be a boon to her family.

is a farmer. She cultivates potatoes, carrots, and beets on the family's own land, and she sells the products at market. Her husband works as a seasonal migrant worker, but he makes every effort to help Satenik around their farm as well.\r\n  \r\nTo expand her cultivation efforts, Satenik has requested a loan. She will use her loan funds to purchase potato seeds and fertilizer. This investment will allow her to gather a good harvest that can be sole at a high price, allowing her to earn a better income to support her family.\r\n \r\nSatenik lives in the village of Arevshat in the Shirak region. Shirak is considered a poor region, where the unemployment rate is very high and living standards are low.

Most of them still preserve their maternal language.  Their community is known for the large number of greenhouses that grow prickly pears.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are very happy and grateful for the opportunity to receive a loan to invest in their businesses.  Manuel, Maria Guadalupe, Josefina, Teresa, Amelia, and Gabriela will invest in hair accessories and costume jewelry.  Victoria will invest in dishes and Icela will invest in cleaning items.  Jos\u00e9 Manuel and Mar\u00eda will invest in prickly pear patches, and Eduardo will invest in glasses.\r\n\r\nAmelia is an extremely responsible and very happy person.  She is 51 years old, and she is the single mother of a now independent son.  Amelia did not have the chance to go to school.  When her son was born she saw the need to start working.  She started selling grocery bags.  At the time it was a productive business activity.  However, the demand started to decline little by little.\r\n\r\nShe currently sells hair accessories and costume jewelry.  She buys this merchandise in the capital of the country, which is where she gets the best prices.  She later sells the merchandise at plazas, markets, and fairs in her community.  \u201cIt is going very well for me in the business.  When I sell a lot, I am very happy.  However, when I don\u2019t sell anything it makes me sad.  It has always been this way; there are good days and bad days.\u201d\r\n\r\nThanks to the loans that she has previously received, she has been able to buy large quantities of merchandise like earrings, bows, hair ties, and others.  With her earnings she managed to get her son ahead.\r\n\r\n*The photo was taken at Manuel\u2019s house.  He has on a white t-shirt and blue pants.  Amelia is seated, and she is wearing a white sweater.  Most of the women in the group also embroider napkins in order to have extra income.  Their handicrafts can be seen in their laps.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6375,"image":{"id":1842263,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy large quantities of merchandise like earrings, bows, hair ties, and others.

She is single, has no children and is studying toward a commercial engineering degree.  Alba is intelligent, responsible, committed to her education, tenacious, sweet, sincere and very hard-working.  She is studying at a private university in the city center.  The city center is known for being surrounded by buildings that house commercial and public offices, restaurants, plazas and all kinds of shops.  The climate is cold and dry with a temperature that varies between 4 and 16 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n<p>\r\nAlba has dark skin and long black hair that is stylishly worn.  Her native tongue is Aymar\u00e1, which she no longer uses because she is going to school and living in the city.  She speaks Spanish at school and at work.  Alba lives with her parents and works in her own business.  They live in their own house, which is built out of brick and cement and has a corrugated metal roof.  They have water, electricity and a sewage service.  \r\n<p>\r\nAlba is studying toward a commercial engineering degree.  She is in the second year of a five-year program.  Alba enjoys helping people and learning business principles.  She has a service-oriented character.  In addition to going to school, she works as a street vendor.  She sells plastics such as jugs, pails, food containers etc.  She says, \"My mother helped me start my business.  The work helps me with a part of my tuition.\"  The advantage of her business is that she doesn't have a set schedule, so she can choose which days to work and which days to study.  The disadvantages are competition and a lack of time.  Alba's dream is to become a professional and create and administrate her own company.  \r\n<p>\r\nAlba wants to purchase a laptop computer and to pay her tuition upfront so she can get a discount.  This is her second loan cycle with the institution in the two years that she has been studying and working. \r\n<p>\r\nThese are Alba's reasons for requesting a loan- to purchase a laptop computer, to pay for her university tuition and to complete her university degree.

This new loan will go to additional supplies of sportswear items to sell, like jogging pants, shirts, uniforms for students, and the like. She will also buy more musical instruments, which she also sells. Her customers will be more likely to buy more items if she has more of her products displayed in her store. An increase in sales will result in a significant increase in profit, which will also result in her business becoming viable and sustainable. Simultaneously, she can provide for the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nLeilani wants to expand her place of business so she can add more items. She meets every week with her *co-fellowship members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

As a Mapan agent, Sri is responsible for processing deposits from customers into their Mapan accounts as well as receiving orders from customers who want to buy products listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer orders, Sri will submit the order via SMS and within 5-10 days the product will be delivered to the customer.

Zhuzugul has a secondary education, and, to provide additional income for her family, she and her husband are involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started this business 16 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 15,000 som (KGS). Her husband provides transportation services with a tractor and a truck to local residents.
