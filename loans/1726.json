She also has a nice orchard, where she so properly raises and takes care of apple, fig, mulberry, pear, and apricot trees. So the sale of these fruits, and also the sale of pork, poultry, and eggs, makes her farm income, thanks to which she covers her family\u2019s minimum needs. \r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan she will be happy to receive as she wants to buy one more pig for her farm and also fodder both for her pigs and chickens.

Zharkynai has an incomplete college education and works in a human resources department. Also, to provide additional income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started this business 14 years ago with a 15,000 som (KGS) purchase of livestock. Thanks to Zharkynai's hard work, today her business contains 3 cows and 0.96 hectares of own land, where she grows beans. Her monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS), but this money is not enough for a decent life for her and her 6-year-old son. This is why, to continue developing her business, Zharkynai requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the Bai-Tushum Bank to buy 2 cows and 10 sheep to increase her livestock headcount. Zharkynai plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing her livestock headcount and plans to save money to build a barn for the livestock."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":485,"image":{"id":1842193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

She has a specialized secondary education and she works as a nurse at a center for family medicine.  In order to provide an additional source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, having started in this field 24 years ago.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has one cow and nine sheep on her farm.  She also has 0.08 hectare of land on which she cultivates potatoes annually.

She sells her vegetables, eggs, and milk to the nearby market. Milking and feeding her own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. She is very thankful that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in her village. Profits from milk sales have enabled her to take care of her family, and she has always yearned to have more dairy cows. Anna is seeking a loan to buy a good breed of dairy cow. She has already identified the breed of cow that she will buy. The cow will produce between 10-20 liters of milk per day. This breed produces milk referred to as \u201cthe ideal drinking milk\u201d because it has all the required quantities of fat and protein. This cow will certainly boost milk production on her farm which will translate into more sales and better income for her and her family. Because of the potential for high milk production, Anna will save more money to fully repay the loan. Anna also believes that through the careful selection and application of strict standards of excellence in keeping her dairy cow, she will have more income, which will improve her living standards.\r\nHelp her out!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":226.04,"image":{"id":1845026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for a quality dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-31T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-30T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.39,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":42400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3000.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3088.47},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3178.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3271.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3367.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3465.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3566.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3671.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3778.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3888.89},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4002.54},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4119.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.79,"local_amount":10141.81,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10418.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.83,"payment_id":681378481},{"amount":109.86,"local_amount":10034.53,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10308.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.56,"payment_id":731023284}],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T22:23:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Montibello","image":null}},{"id":860916,"name":"Eva Sandrit","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ella es Eva es una ganadera de tan solo 20 a\u00f1os de edad, pero es casada y junto con su pareja trabaja arduamente para generar los ingresos para mantener a su hijo de 3 a\u00f1os de edad.\nDesde j\u00f3venes decidieron emprender su camino, buscar su propia felicidad, alejados de los comentarios con los que lo azotaban diariamente por irse a vivir juntos a tan corta de edad.\nEva inicio su negocio de ganader\u00eda por necesidad econ\u00f3mica, y aprovecho los conocimientos que aprendi\u00f3 de su padre quien ha sido uno de los pocos apoyos, la motiva y la ayuda para que crezca como empresaria.\nSu sue\u00f1o es forjar junto con su pareja un lindo hogar, amoroso y c\u00e1lido y de su parte ayudara para la causa con su actividad econ\u00f3mica.\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de tres terneros.\n","en":"Eva is a rancher who is only 20 years old.

She's intelligent, committed to her studies, persevering, responsible, and very hardworking.  She's studying to be a chef in the hotel program located in the central business district, an area known for commercial offices, public offices, restaurants, plazas, and all types of businesses.  The climate is cold and dry and the temperature varies from 4 to 16 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica is dark and wears her reddish hair in a stylish hairstyle.  Her native language is Aymara, which she no longer speaks because she's in school and works and lives in the city.  She speaks Spanish in school and for work.  She lives with her sister and her brother-in-law, who work in their own business.  They live in a house owned by the three of them.  The house is made of brick and cement with a corrugated metal roof; they have potable water, electricity, and gas.\r\n\r\nShe's studying to be a chef and is in her second of three years in the program.  She enjoys cooking and pleasing people with exquisite flavors.  She likes to understand the combination of flavors.  She has a helping personality.\r\n\r\nShe also works as a medical assistant, a job she has had since she finished college 28 years ago.  \"I have worked as a medical assistant since I finished college.  I want to go out on my own and open a restaurant,\" she said.  The advantage of her job is that she's paid monthly.  The disadvantage is the schedule and her dependence on her superiors.\r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica's dream is to be a chef and open and operate a restaurant.  She wants to make two payments toward her program and buy kitchen utensils like cutlery and pots and pans.

Most of the rainwater goes to waste and therefore Mary is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to buy a water tank. With the water tank she will be able to harvest and store rainwater in the tank. This loan will be of much help because Mary will not be walking for long distances in search of this precious commodity.

They formed a partnership to generate a larger working capital.\r\n\r\nThey buy the animal and cut it up into different pieces to sell them by the pound or by the kilo to the people from the neighbouring community, who, between restaurants and families in general, are their major customers. \r\n\r\nLittle by little, they have been adding other products such as chicken, pork, fish, and eggs in order to diversify their offer, just as their customers like it. Their business hours are from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe driver from the abattoir is who supplies the meat to them daily. \r\n\r\nThey offer home delivery services, but it proves to be a great challenge because they don't have a vehicle to help them improve their delivery times. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, she is requesting a Kiva loan. This is the first loan that she is asking from the Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo.

Today, this humble mother sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer, and because of the immense knowledge she has in farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding. \r\n\r\nA good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from getting diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain.

eight children.  Her oldest child is 30, the youngest is 8 years old. Everyone in Etibar's family is very friendly; they work together, supporting and helping one another in difficult situations. Etibar's three oldest sons are making a living as migrant workers.  Every month they send money to their parents.  Etibar has a secondary education.  In order to provide a source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture.  Thanks to her very hard work, she now has five cows and 21 sheep on her farm.  She also grows cotton, clover and corn on 0.5 hectare of leased land and on one hectare of her own land.  In total, Etibar's activity brings her a monthly income of up to 20,000 som (KGS), which is obviously not sufficient to provide a decent life to her family.  After discussing the matter with her husband and children, and in order to further grow her farming business, Etibar decided to turn to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and to request a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy livestock.  Etibar is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further develop her business, which will help her to increase her family's income and also to save some money to build a house for her sons."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1019.07,"image":{"id":1844675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy additional livestock in order to boost her family's income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Konurat villade, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-03-31T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-30T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.69,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Etibar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7063},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7272},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7487},{"due_date":"2015-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7709},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7936},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":8171},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":8413},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":8661},{"due_date":"2015-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":8918},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":9181},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":9453},{"due_date":"2016-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":9736}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.27},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.74},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":232.95,"local_amount":14335,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:42:20Z","rounded_local_amount":14515.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649514249},{"amount":121.66,"local_amount":7487,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:50:23Z","rounded_local_amount":7581.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664996011},{"amount":125.27,"local_amount":7709,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":7805.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291422},{"amount":128.96,"local_amount":7936,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:54:03Z","rounded_local_amount":8035.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500675},{"amount":132.78,"local_amount":8171,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":8273.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711411607},{"amount":136.65,"local_amount":8413,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:59:55Z","rounded_local_amount":8518.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.06,"payment_id":730933824},{"amount":134.11,"local_amount":8661,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":8769.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.63,"payment_id":752025900}],"funded_date":"2015-04-28T16:28:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":860792,"name":"Se\u00f1or Pasion Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cSE\u00d1OR PASION\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Yucay, perteneciente a la provincia de Urubamba y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

Thanks to her very hard work and her dedication, Gulmira now cultivates 0.9 hectare of land on which she grows beans for resale to wholesale buyers.  She also has two cows and four sheep on her farm.  Gulmira's husband, a war veteran, receives a pension.  Gulmira herself makes a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to buy six sheep.  Gulmira is a member of the \"Ay-Sezim\" group which comprises another two people, so three members in total.

She is married and does not have any children. She is entrepreneurial, kind, responsible, hardworking, and very good with her customers. Her business is a neighborhood store, from which she sells food and basic need items.\r\n\r\nShe runs her business out of the southern part of the city, a residential and highly populated area of old and rustic homes. Many of these homes do not have basic services, so people get along by forming areas of commerce and manufacturing in every neighborhood. The climate is warm and the daytime temperatures ranges between 22 and 32 degrees Centigrade.\r\n\r\nRosmery has an olive-skinned complexion and long dark hair which she pulls back. She has brown eyes and a robust complexion. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks at home, and she speaks Spanish in everyday life and in business. She shares her life with her husband, who works as a driver. They live in their own home which is made out of brick and cement, with a corrugated iron roof. Their home has water, electricity and plumbing.\r\n\r\nHer business is the sale of food, such as sugar, bread, pasta, rice, eggs and soda; as well as everyday products such as cleaning products. She sells out of a room in her home which she uses as a store. The store is open every day of the week during the daytime. \r\n\r\nRosmery says, \"I started my business because there was a lack of neighborhood stores in this area, and the whole neighborhood now shops at my store.\" The advantage of her store is that she doesn't have any competition; the disadvantage is that she must always be well-stocked. Her dream is to open a mini-market with a greater variety of products. She wants to purchase a variety of food and basic necessity products in order to stock her store and meet the needs of her customers. \r\n\r\nThis is the first year that Rosmery has been in this business, and this is her first loan cycle with this institution. For these reasons Rosmery requests a loan to purchase food and other basic items to stock her store and to meet the needs of her clients."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":776.69,"image":{"id":1844383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-31T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-30T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-26T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-10T04:00:00Z","amount":78.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T04:00:00Z","amount":104.82},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":110.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":115.07},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":118.15},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":122.9},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":126.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":134.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T04:00:00Z","amount":139.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T04:00:00Z","amount":143.42},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":150.18},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":155.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.82},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.07},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.84},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.42},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.18},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":78.25,"local_amount":78.25,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":78.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564589},{"amount":104.82,"local_amount":104.82,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":104.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046553},{"amount":111.24,"local_amount":111.24,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:41Z","rounded_local_amount":111.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344373},{"amount":114.58,"local_amount":114.58,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":114.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554588},{"amount":118.15,"local_amount":118.15,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":118.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468689},{"amount":122.9,"local_amount":122.9,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":122.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296541},{"amount":126.75,"local_amount":126.75,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":126.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076766}],"funded_date":"2015-04-28T15:43:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kati Mayfield","image":470169}},{"id":861399,"name":"Nenita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nenita is a 40-year-old married woman and a mother of a 3-year-old child from Merida, Leyte.

This area is known for being very dynamic and the majority of its inhabitants work in agriculture and animal breeding, as it's a place with lots of vegetation. Maria lives here, she's 69 years old, and several years ago her beloved husband passed away. But that relationship gave her 3 children who are now adults, two of them live in her home. Maria is a woman whose lot in life is to work hard so she can make a living and not have to depend on anybody. She has a stationery store and a library, and works there every day with the assistance of her children who also earn their daily bread since it's a business that the family shares. The busiest sales month is when the school year starts because many people look for her business to buy their lists of school supplies, and this is because she offers a great variety of products at a very good price. They've been working for 15 years for the sake of the family and thanks to the loans they receive they're able to pull through, for which they're very grateful.This loan will be used to buy all kinds of school supplies and books to stock her business.

Hay d\u00edas excepcionales en que no puede salir a vender y definitivamente no le agrada romper con su rutina que le permite salir a otros lugares, distraerse y tener su propio dinero. \n\nRosa agradece mucho las oportunidades de financiamiento que ha recibido por parte de VisionFund y que como este nuevo pr\u00e9stamo le permitir\u00e1 comprar m\u00e1s ingredientes para hacer sus dulces.

My mother and grandmother used to do this to help cover expenses.\"  And like they did, Rosa now sells sweets in nearby communities all week long.  At first it was a challenge for her to overcome her shyness and approach people more easily.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Rosa does her housework and leaves the house at 10:00 a.m., latest.  She carries with her little bags of the sweets she has prepared and does not return home until 4:00 p.m., having sold everything.  There are exceptional days when she cannot go out but she does not like to interrupt her routine because it allows her to visit other places, entertain herself and have her own income.\r\n\r\nRosa is very grateful for the loan opportunities received through VisionFund, since this new loan will allow her to buy more ingredients for her sweets. She will buy cane sugar, sesame, squash seed, coconut, pineapple, brown paper and plastic bags to increase production.\r\n\r\nThanks to her earnings, Rosa has decided to start a new business.  Now she also sells natural body lotions and is happy with the results she has achieved so far.\r\n\r\n* The photo was taken at Irma's house.

Alice is an enthusiastic, 46-year-old lady from Lemotit villlage in Kenya who practices dairy farming. This year, she wants to grow her farm business through introducing poultry farming. The major problem she faces is lack of capital to support the expansion. \r\n\r\nAlice is seeking a Kiva loan of 15,000 Kenya Shillings (KES) to buy poultry. A poultry farming business is easy to start and run.

For the past five years she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been growing maize, cabbage, tomatoes, and also she keeps dairy cows. Esther has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. \r\n\r\nAlthough she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of the timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\" she said. \r\n\r\nEsther mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Esther is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge, hence suffering so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetable and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan Esther is going to achieve her dream and goals. \r\n\r\nAccessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Esther feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Esther will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market. Also she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market, hence increased income level. \r\n\r\nEsther is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work.

She is married, with two sons ages 15 and 12 years old, and her business is to make polleras (traditional skirts.) She is a good mother, independent, active, entrepreneurial, responsible and hard working. She works in the \"Tilata\" zone, a residentially developed area located in the altiplano at 13,452 feet above sea level, characterized for supplying 32 underground water wells to the city. It has a cold and dry climate which fluctuates during the day between 0-12 degrees Celsius. Aurora is dark complected, brown eyes, long, black, braided hair, robust build, short stature, traditionally dressed (hat, shall, pollera.)  Her native tongue is Aymara which she speaks at home with her family, and she speaks Spanish as general knowledge and for business. She shares her life with her husband, who works as a clerk, and her children who are in school. They live in their own home, built of brick and cement with corrugated metal roofing.  They have drinking water, sewage, electricity and household gas. Her business is to make polleras. Polleras are clothing skirts used by the traditional woman. The latest trends are in red, yellow, purple, pink, light blue and green. Designs can be with floral prints, animal prints, circles of diverse colors, and embroidered by the skillful hands of her handicraft shop.  When you come into her \"Pollereria\" the first thing you see is the latest designs of hand made clothing, sewn with the help of her sewing machine. Every time a new fabric touches her hand, it converts into an innovative design. \"in the past, polleras were made with big flowers, but currently fashion changed and they are made with small flowers with a white background..\" she states. The advantage of her business is that these clothing items are popular and they are easily sold. The disadvantage is that she does not have a stable clientele. Her dream is to build a big tailoring shop. She wants to invest the loan to buy fabric to make polleras wholesale and sell them wholesale. This is the first loan with the institution in 17 years of working in this activity.

She is 47 years old and she resides with her family in Batasan, Quezon City, Philippines. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for more than two years, and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. They work hard because they are determined to have a better income.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5-PHPs worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Salvacion would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 30,000 PHP (Philippine pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Salvacion hopes to maintain an increasing profit from her business. She dreams for her family to be always happy and healthy.

She started planting crops and raising livestock in 1995 as a source of income for her family. Thanks to Sharapat's hard work, she currently has nine cows, 40 sheep, and a 2.65 hectare plot of arable land where she grows alfalfa to sell. Her monthly income from farming is around 18,000 som (KGS). In order to expand her business, Sharapat applied for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) with Bai Tushum Bank to buy sheep to fatten and sell.

Asel has a higher education and is involved in animal husbandry and farming. Thanks to Asel's hard work, her farm contains a horse, 30 sheep and 2.50 hectares of her own land, where she grows beans for sale. Asel's monthly income amounts to about 8,000 som (KGS).

His biggest challenge at the moment is lack of an adequate mode of transporting milk to the market. To solve this problem, he needs external financing. \r\n\r\nGeorge is seeking a KES 65,000 loan to buy a reasonably priced Indian motorcycle. Most farmers go for this type of motorcycle due to its economic and versatile nature. With your loan investment, George will use his motorcycle to transport milk to the market and drop his daughter off to school.

Munira's homestead brings in about 10,000 som (KGS) per month, that serves the basis for the cost of food and household needs of the family. <br \/><br \/>With the aim of further developing her homestead, Munira applied to Bai-Tushum Bank for a loan of 110,000 som (KGS) to purchase two dairy cows to increase her livestock count and sales of organic milk. <br \/><br \/>Munira plans to invest profits from the loan in further expanding her homestead, and also in the future intends to save money for her children's weddings."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1847123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase two dairy cows in order to increase organic milk sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bakai-Ata, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-03-31T16:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-30T16:10:04Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Munira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":484.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":484.09},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":403.41},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-28T21:23:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":861693,"name":"Sandra Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sandra, de 30 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta s\u00e9ptimo grado, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ada y su pareja tiene un negocio de venta de cielos falsos y ventanas, tienen tres hijos, los cuales estudian.\n\nSandra, se dedica a trabajar junto a su esposo en el negocio que tiene desde hace varios a\u00f1os, el negocio est\u00e1 el centro de la ciudad y el horario de atenci\u00f3n es de 7:00 a.m a 3:00 p.m.\n\nSandra, solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar vidrio para ventanas y otros materiales que necesita para su negocio y as\u00ed poder cubrir los pedidos de sus clientes, de esa manera lograra cubrir las necesidades que tiene. \n\nEl sue\u00f1o de Sandra, es tener un negocio m\u00e1s grande y bien establecido, para darle lo mejor a sus hijos y tengan todo lo que necesiten.","en":"Sandra is 30 years old, has a seventh grade education, is in a relationship and her partner has a windows and dropped ceilings business.

His second business is milk. He raises milk cows to sell milk to the cheese producers of the area. The two activities take up his whole day. \"My work as a cobbler allows me to have two businesses. The milk I have done all my life\" he commented. The advantage of both businesses is that both have regular clients. The disadvantage is the climate. at times there is no grass for the cattle and when it rains he has to give up his cobbling as he works outside. <br \/><br \/>His dream is to build a brick house.

She has been farming crops, but only for subsistence purposes. She also grows vegetables, a bit of maize and some grass for her cow. Now she is requesting a loan to grow vegetables on a bigger scale to sell. The demand for horticultural products such as fruits and vegetables has grown steadily in Kenya in recent years. Even though they have become one of the top-traded agricultural products, there is still plenty of room to expand and Elizabeth is very excited to enter this field. With a Kiva loan, this can be easily achieved and in no time, her farm will start making money. She will plough the profits she expects to earn back into her business to fuel further growth. The increased income she expects to earn will help her improve her family's life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":153.26,"image":{"id":1845302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to expand her farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-03-31T16:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-30T16:30:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.17,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":11.31,"local_amount":976.54,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1044.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.08,"payment_id":681378489},{"amount":57.71,"local_amount":5016.28,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5366.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.81,"payment_id":696588155},{"amount":26.44,"local_amount":2368.55,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2533.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.19,"payment_id":711506461},{"amount":27.71,"local_amount":2430.85,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2600.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.65,"payment_id":731023293},{"amount":26.92,"local_amount":2345.09,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2508.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.44,"payment_id":752111445}],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T14:24:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":861540,"name":"Callebu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Callebu is 55 years old.

Meet Albinah, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Kapsowar area of Kenya, near the famous Rift valley. <br \/><br \/>Albina, 39, has been farming for the past 10 years. Through these years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Albinah is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. <br \/><br \/>Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Kapsowar area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Albinah could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. <br \/><br \/>Accessing funds has been a challenge for Albinah, but she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Albinah believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals.

Today, animal husbandry is the family's main source of income.  He learned all the details of the business from his father and he now makes sure to implement what his father taught him, on the job.  At the moment he owns three head of large cattle and six head of smaller livestock.  He wants to buy an additional cow in order to provide milk to his large family.  A cow costs a lot of money though, and Mirzonazar doesn't have quite enough money for this purchase.

This year, Uktam planted potatoes and tomatoes. He wants to have another source of income, in order to fully cover the family's expenses. As head of the household, he feels a responsibility for his wife and children, therefore he must support them with food, clothing, health, and education.<br \/><br \/>Uktam decided to open his own grocery store. He found premises, arranged them as a store, and installed shelves. It remains only for him to bring in the food products. He does not have sufficient money for the transportation and purchase of goods, and he sees a way out of this situation by getting a loan.

Meet Magdalena, a hard-working, very honest and warm-hearted farmer who hails from the Kericho area of Kenya, which has one of the best weather patterns on Earth that favors farming.<br \/><br \/>Magdalena\u2019s upbringing was very challenging and, because of this, she promised herself that she would work hard and get out of poverty. That is why she started farming 10 years ago. Through farming, she has been able to earn a decent income. Magdalena is the breadwinner in her family, and this really pushes her to work hard so that her family will have a bright future and also so her parents will have a comfortable life.<br \/><br \/>Magdalena is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming so that she can use the excess space on her land.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He lives with his partner and has a 12 years old son.  His business is a springs workshop.\r\n\r\nHe is a good father, entrepreneur, steady, patient, responsible and hardworking.  He developed his business in the \"16 de julio\" zone, an area characterized by manufacturing output and its fair on Thursdays and Sundays, where you can find anything from a needle to sew clothes to a tractor to sow the land. Its cold (4-12 degrees Celsius) weather and very strong solar rays can burn skin, at an average altitude of 3,800 meters above sea level.\r\n\r\nMario has a dark complexion, short black hair, brown eyes, short, and medium physique. His native Aymara language is spoken in this place and generally speaking, Spanish by culture and in the business you do. His life he shares with his wife who works and with his son studying in school.  They live in a rented room, which is built of brick, cement and a tin roof.  The house has water, gas, sewage, and electricity.\r\n\r\nHis business is a springs workshop; the springs are part of the suspension of a vehicle, they are responsible for supporting the weight of the load and also to keep the axes centered. Typical jobs of this work are recharged hydraulic zippers, greased bearings, placing aluminum studs, emptying catalysts and others.  The activity is performed Monday through Saturday during work hours in a room fitted out as a workshop near his home. \"I have worked in garages since I was very young, I did different activities until I went solo, I now have my workshop which I manage ...\" he says.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of his business is the experience he has, the disadvantage is the lack of material with which to work. His dream is to expand his shop and provide other services such as tire repair and mechanics.  He wants to purchase springs by wholesale and other work materials for his workshop.  This is the 1st sequence of loans with the institution in which he has four years working independently.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Mario is requesting a loan to purchase springs to have working material for his garage.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":648.11,"image":{"id":1845755,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto

Her business involves selling quinoa.  Graciela is a wonderful mother who is understanding, patient, responsible, hardworking, and a good listener.  She conducts her business in the community of Batallas, a rural area that is near the sacred Lake Titicaca.  The residents work in agriculture, livestock breeding, and fishing.  The weather is cold and dry, with a temperature that varies throughout the day between 0-14 degrees Celsius.  <br \/><br \/>Graciela has a dark complexion, long black braided hair, brown eyes, a short stature, and a thin physique.  She wears traditional apparel (hat, shawl, and skirt).  Her native language is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks in her town, but she also speaks Spanish as part of the general culture and to carry out her business.  She shares her life with her children.  The two oldest attend school, while the younger ones are not of school age.  They live in a brick and cement house with a metal sheet roof.  Their home receives electricity, sewage services, and water that comes from a spring.  <br \/><br \/>Graciela\u2019s business is selling quinoa that is produced on her land.  She also buys from other producers so that she can generate more sales.  \u201cSelling quinoa is an unstable market because it is abundant in the months of March through May (the harvesting season), but is scarce in August through October.  Farmers store quinoa as a safety net until the next harvest,\u201d says Graciela.  The advantage of her business is she is able to produce on her own land, while the disadvantage is the low production that occurs at the change of season.  Her dream is to have quinoa to sell throughout the year.  Graciela also wants to buy \u201cchu\u00f1os\u201d [dried potatoes] and regular potatoes to sell during the time when quinoa production is low.  This is her first loan cycle with Emprender.  Graciela has been in this business for six years.  <br \/><br \/>For the reasons previously stated, Graciela is requesting a loan in order to buy \u201cchu\u00f1os\u201d and regular potatoes to sell
