Guldasta is involved in agriculture and with it brings in a very important source of income home. Her husband is a teacher, but because a teacher's salary is very low, the income from the agricultural business is the primary source for the family's budget. Guldasta has to finish her crop sowing later this year than usual. She planted seeds and now has to treat the soil with mineral fertilizers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions.

Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and crops. \r\n\r\nCaroline is seeking a loan to expand her horticulture farm. Her biggest challenge over the years as a farmer has been the lack of adequate capital. \r\n\r\nIt is very hard for small farmers to save enough capital for expansion, since farming is marred with all sorts of external risks, such as climatic conditions, pests and diseases, political instability, fluctuation of prices and high costs of inputs. \r\n\r\nBecause of these factors, the sure way farmers can obtain adequate capital is through leveraging their businesses. With your loan investment, Caroline is going to expand her horticultural farm in order to increase its output. \r\n\r\nIf and when the investment pays off, Caroline will plow the profits back into the

Also, to provide additional income for her family, she has been involved in animal husbandry since 1995, when she started this business with 20,000 som (KGS). Her husband and children actively help her with the business. Today, her farm contains a cow, 25 sheep and 2.30 hectares of land, where she grows beans. In order to continue developing her business, Anar requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) from the Bai-Tushum Bank to buy fertilizers and cultivate the soil.

Su vida la comparte con sus hijos que estudian en la escuela, viven en un cuarto alquilado construido de ladrillo y cemento con techo de calamina que cuenta con agua potable, energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y alcantarillado. La necesidad de ampliar su actividad y mejorar su negocio la impuls\u00f3 a formar una banca de personas con negocios como; llanter\u00eda, venta de blusas, servicio de fotocopias, venta de refrescos naturales, venta de frutas, venta de cosm\u00e9ticos por cat\u00e1logo y venta de empanadas, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y prosperar en sus negocios.

She has 3 children of ages 12, 10 and 8. Her business is selling traditional food. She is a good and fair mother, kind, steadfast, responsible and hard working. She carries out her business in the \u201cplan 3000\u201d zone, an area known for productivity and manufacturing where there are small businesses in areas such as tailoring, design and crafts, which imitate foreign products to sell them in the central marketplace. It is the most populated neighborhood in the city and has a warm tropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 21-32 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nRoxana is short and has dark skin, brown eyes, long black hair she keeps tied up and a robust physique. Her mother tongue is Guarani which she speaks with her family and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for the work that she does (she is standing, second from the left, wearing a black blouse).\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her children who are in school. She lives in a rented room made of brick and cement with a sheet metal roof. It has potable water, electricity and sewage services. \r\n\r\nNeeding to expand and improve her business pushed her to establish a bank with people with jobs like tire repair, photocopying services, selling blouses, natural drinks, fruit, cosmetics from a catalog and empanadas, in order to request a loan and grow their businesses.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling traditional food like locotos rellenos (peppers, diced meat, onion), arroz con queso (rice, milk, cheese), aj\u00ed de panza (pork belly, onion and tomato accompanied with rice) and others. She does this work every day of the week from a fixed stall. \u201cMy mother showed me how to cook, then I worked as a helper and I am now independent\u201d she says. The advantage of her business is that she sells in the same market where she restocks supplies from. The disadvantage is that the place is far away and less people circulate during the week. Her dream is to expand her business and open another at a nearby market. She wishes to purchase tables and chairs for attending to her customers in an appropriate way. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the three years that she has been doing this work.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Roxana requests a loan to buy tables and chairs for attending to a greater number of customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":1845373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables and chairs in order to attend to a greater number of customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-03-31T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-04-30T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":2575,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Candy Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Constantina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julio Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaneth Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-26T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":17500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-11T04:00:00Z","amount":1338.72},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T04:00:00Z","amount":1340.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T04:00:00Z","amount":1364.73},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T04:00:00Z","amount":1389.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T04:00:00Z","amount":1414.86},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T04:00:00Z","amount":1440.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T04:00:00Z","amount":1466.82},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T04:00:00Z","amount":1493.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T04:00:00Z","amount":1520.7},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T04:00:00Z","amount":1548.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T04:00:00Z","amount":1576.57},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T04:00:00Z","amount":1605.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.98},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.98},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.76},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":799.47,"local_amount":5433.34,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5484.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564590},{"amount":420.17,"local_amount":2855.46,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2882.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046554},{"amount":435.59,"local_amount":2960.34,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2988.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344374},{"amount":683.58,"local_amount":4645.66,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4689.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554589},{"amount":236.19,"local_amount":1605.2,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1620.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468690}],"funded_date":"2015-04-17T17:45:31Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hasmin Sherwin"}},{"id":861875,"name":"Jennifer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jennifer, 40, is married and has three children attending school.

On average, she is able to make an income of USD 2.00 a day.\r\n\r\nShe wants to improve the general living conditions of the entire family by having a latrine to use because there is no latrine in her house now. Therefore, she is requesting a loan from Kiva to build a latrine. By doing this, she can help her family members gain access to sanitation, promote their health, and help to lessen environmental deterioration.

She told us that she joined Pro Mujer six years ago after being invited by a friend who was a client of the institution. Nancy currently runs a business selling meals and she let us know that she started this business several years ago with a small amount of capital to set it up. She also mentioned that she learnt how to run this business from her niece who has a similar business.\r\n\r\nThe loan that Nancy is currently taking out will be used to increase her capital (buying groceries and meat in bulk) that she will acquire from vendors in the city of El Alto and later use to create meals which she will sell in her workplace.

It is formed by eight members and it is led by a board where Mrs. Justina is the President. The businesses run by this community group are diverse, among them: blanket sales, hat sales, pants sales, sweatsuit sales, gaiters sales, sportswear sales, comforter sales, and pastry sales. The loan obtained will benefit small micro entrepreneurs, of which Mrs. Justina is part of. She stated that this is the first time she participates with Pro Mujer, as she responded to an invitation sent through a massive promotion done in her zone. Currently, she has a knitting business. She started this business several years ago, learning the knitting technique at her school. Later, she obtained a little capital to invest on an independent business.

She is 21, a young wife and the mother of one child.  She lives with her husband and her mother-in-law in the city of Tursunzoda.  She is a smart and talented young woman.  She runs her own business: she sews women's clothes and works from orders, at home.  She takes care of the household and works as a seamstress at the same time.  She likes her activity for the daily earnings that it brings.  Mahliyo makes her own living and helps her husband to provide for the family.  Nowadays, however, her old sewing machine doesn't fulfill some of its functions any more.  For this reason, Mahliyo has decided to take a loan.  She will use this loan to buy a new \"Yamata\" sewing machine and, with the rest of the money, some sewing supplies.  She thanks you in advance.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":272.91,"image":{"id":1847336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sewing machine and some sewing supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursun-zoda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-04-01T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-01T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.35,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahliyo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":194.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":206.79},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":204.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":230.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":230.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":237.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":255.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":261.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":272.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":285.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":294.78},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":326.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.19},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.32},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.73},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.69},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.59},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.05,"local_amount":194.58,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:11:44Z","rounded_local_amount":194.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649621674},{"amount":36.19,"local_amount":206.79,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":207.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665101641},{"amount":35.8,"local_amount":204.59,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":204.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681399750},{"amount":40.33,"local_amount":230.44,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":230.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696609831},{"amount":39.84,"local_amount":230.38,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:30:45Z","rounded_local_amount":230.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.48,"payment_id":711525855},{"amount":40,"local_amount":237.58,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:07:40Z","rounded_local_amount":237.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.58,"payment_id":731041618},{"amount":42.35,"local_amount":255.1,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":255.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.29,"payment_id":752130585}],"funded_date":"2015-04-01T13:52:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":861920,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is 42 years old, married, and had a child.

is a smallholder farmer from Songhor location in Nandi Hills, Kenya. Nandi Hills is known for its cold weather and craggy terrains. Eliud's home is on a 0.5 acre farm in the Nandi hills where he stays with his wife and 1-year-old child. On the farm, he owns two dairy cows, eight heads of poultry and 20 trees. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Eliud, he can not implement crop farming due to the physical state of his farm - too steep and rocky. This, however, can not stop Eliud from profiting from the lucrative cereal produce business that is thriving in the region. Eliud may not be growing cereals, but he aggregates cereal produce from farmers who do. When purchasing, he is able to secure produce at a reduced price caused by the saturation of cereal produce in the market after harvest season. He then transports and sells the produce to far off markets with less circulation of cereal produce. The key to his success is having enough capital to lay out for inventory.\r\n\r\nEliud is seeking a loan to buy cereals from producers. He is going to use the model explained earlier to make additional income besides the one he makes from selling milk. Additional income will help him meet growing basic needs of his new family.

Su negocio es la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de salte\u00f1as, (La salte\u00f1a es una empanada rellena con carne de res o de pollo, huevo duro, especias, y otros ingredientes, horneada, tradicional en la gastronom\u00eda popular) negocio que comenz\u00f3 desde su casa, haciendo una m\u00ednima inversi\u00f3n con la venta de empanadas de queso y algunas masitas que llevan insumos f\u00e1ciles de encontrar en el mercado, a medida que recuperaba su capital, invert\u00eda en la oferta de salte\u00f1as para el p\u00fablico. \u201ca qui\u00e9n no le gusta una salte\u00f1a a media ma\u00f1ana, es tradicional y los clientes la buscan desde muy tempranas horas de la ma\u00f1ana\u2026\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que sabe hornear y tiene experiencia en la elaboraci\u00f3n de salte\u00f1as, la desventaja es la competencia con alimentos alternos fr\u00edos y calientes. Su sue\u00f1o es abrir un snack en su domicilio, ella desea ampliar su negocio mediante la compra de un horno grande e insumos necesarios para su negocio (harina, manteca, huevo, carnes, etc.). Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 4 a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta actividad. \nEs por esos motivos que Yolanda solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de un horno amplio para elaborar salte\u00f1as en mayor cantidad, vender por mayor y aumentar sus ventas.\n","en":"Yolanda is a 31 year old woman. She lives with her partner, she has 3 children ages 9,7, and 5 years old. Her business is the preparation and sale of saltenas (empanadas.) She is a good mother, independent, understanding, patient, responsible, and hard working. She works in the southern zone of the city, a residential area well populated with ancient and rustic homes. Many of these homes do not have basic services. They live together forming a point of trade and manufacturing in all the areas. The flooring in this area is primarily sandy, with fine sand and other alcaline material. The climate is warm with a temperature which fluctuates between 21-32 degrees Celsius. Yolanda is dark complected, with long, black hair tied back, brown eyes. Her native tongue is Guarani which she speaks at home, and she speaks Spanish as general knowledge and for business. (Standing in the middle, she wears a black blouse and flower printed pants, she carries a green purse with a yellow handle.) She shares her life with her partner who works in trade and her children. The two oldest children are in school, and the small one is not yet of school age. They live in a small room which they own, built of brick with a corrugated metal roof. It has running water, electricity, and sewage. The need to expand her business pushed her to join a group of people with businesses such as: food sales, color TV repairs, tire repair, plastic sales, vegetable sales, perfume sales, and breakfast sales, and to request a loan and improve their activities. Her business is the preparation and sale of saltenas. (Saltenas are empanadas stuffed with beef or chicken, hard boiled egg, spices, and other ingredients. They are baked, and are a traditional dish in popular cuisine.) She started this business at home, making a small investment with the sale of cheese empanadas and other pastries with ingredients easy to find in the market. As soon as she regained her capital, she reinvested it in selling saltenas to the public. \"who doesn't like a saltena at mid morning, it is traditional and customers look for them since early morning...\" she stated. The advantage of her business is that she knows how to bake and has experience making saltenas, the disadvantage is the competition with other cold and hot foods. Her dream is to open a snack bar in her house. She wants to expand her business by buying a large oven and the necessary ingredients for her business (flour, lard, eggs, meats, etc.) This is the first loan with the institution in 4 years of owning this business. This is why Yolanda needs a loan to buy a large oven to make saltenas in larger quantities, to sell them wholesale and increase her sales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4525,"image":{"id":1845858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy a large oven to make saltenas (empanadas) in larger quantities, sell them wholesale and increase their sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-04-01T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-01T03:30:03Z","loan_amount":4525,"lender_count":116,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edil","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rody","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-27T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":31000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-26T04:00:00Z","amount":3008.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T04:00:00Z","amount":3077.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T04:00:00Z","amount":3189.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T04:00:00Z","amount":3305.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T04:00:00Z","amount":3402.22},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T04:00:00Z","amount":3569.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":3679.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T04:00:00Z","amount":3813.9},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T04:00:00Z","amount":3952.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":439.14},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":449.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":482.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":496.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":521.04},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":556.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":576.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":888.38,"local_amount":6086.19,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":6094.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564596},{"amount":465.6,"local_amount":3189.72,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3193.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046559},{"amount":482.55,"local_amount":3305.84,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3310.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344380},{"amount":496.61,"local_amount":3402.22,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3406.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554595},{"amount":521.04,"local_amount":3569.53,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3574.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468696},{"amount":537.15,"local_amount":3679.94,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3684.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296547},{"amount":1133.67,"local_amount":7766.56,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:33Z","rounded_local_amount":7776.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076771}],"funded_date":"2015-04-28T09:04:19Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Virginia Contreras Smith","image":1715363}},{"id":861963,"name":"Jennifer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jennifer lives in Kampala, Uganda.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Village Titigunguri is a slum area of Titilagarh town in the Bolangir district of Odisha, India. In this village, most of the households belong to a poorer community. The people of this village are mainly weavers of bamboo craft. They reside in small huts, and their children hardly get better education. <br \/><br \/>The main business of this community is making hand fans of bamboo and selling them in the market and supplying them to traders. The income they get from this is hand-to-mouth only for them. <br \/><br \/>Dhanamati, aged about 32, is a woman from this community. She is standing in the back row, the second person from the right hand side with a raised hand in the photo. She is married and lives with her husband, one son, and two daughters. <br \/> <br \/>Dhanamati is doing her traditional work of bamboo hand fans, and kula, bhuga and tupa making (baskets), and marketing them at the nearest market. Both Dhanamati and her husband together are engaged with the assembly of hand fans, kula, bhuga and tupa. They procure the raw bamboo from a distance of 100 kms. Her husband goes by train to bring the material. Both the wife and husband sell the finished products in the town and the nearby local market. <br \/><br \/>Apart from making of hand fans, kula, bhuga and tupa, Dhanamati also procures finished products from the neighbors and sells them in bulk to the traders in other places. Dhanamati earns a monthly income of Rs. 5,500 from this business. According to Dhanamati, this small income is not at all sufficient to meet the requirements of her family and a better livelihood.

Meet one of Ruma\u2019s agents, Deni. Deni lives in Majalengka, a regency in West Java, located about 5 hour\u2019s drive from Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. \r\n\r\nDeni owns a stall that sells wall paint, and provides bill payment services to his community. He decided to join Ruma because he wants to expand his business in another sector, which is technology. Deni is a person who is curious, and never stops learning. He attracts many customers.\r\n\r\nAs the business has grown, Deni needs additional capital, and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva.

He uses milk income to take care of his wife, who has been with him for 28 years, and 5 children.\r\n \r\nJohn's major challenge is brought about by poor road conditions. Therefore he is seeking a loan to buy a motorcycle that is affordable, economic, versatile and suitable for poor road conditions.\r\n \r\nIt is always a nightmare for many farmers from the area to transport their produce to the market. Although many road development projects are ongoing around the country, the majority of roads are in a very poor condition. In Kaplelmet, for instance, roads are bad - cracked and riddled with potholes, invariably uneven, and essentially made up of rocky tracks. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, John will acquire an Indian motorcycle that can handle roads impassable by cars. With this, he will be able to transport his produce to the market as often as he pleases. He can also make extra income by offering transportation services to other members of his community. Additional income from this investment will be used to improve his family's living standards.

Arriving early at a nearby river, Mercy and her mother have used this gigantic mosquito net as a sieve to catch fish. In her community, others use these mosquito nets as fishing nets. This has been a health hazard to the community as these insecticide-treated nets contaminate the water with chemicals.\r\n\r\nGrowing up amidst poverty and seeing the misuse of mosquito nets, Mercy has tried to find ways of solving problems in the community at the same time as feeding her family. One of her solutions has been to educate her community about the correct use of mosquito nets and give advice to fisherman about strong fishing nets.\r\n\r\nMercy is now 36 years old and a mother of one beautiful girl. She runs a small business selling fishing nets and fishing hooks which she buys from Tanzania. Her business has helped reduce the contamination of rivers with insecticide from mosquito nets.\r\n\r\nWhen she heard about Thrive Microfinance she formed a group called Sunset to take up a group loan. She and a group of three women hope that a loan from Kiva will help them expand their businesses and supply more fishing nets to their community and other neighbouring communities with similar problems.

He has three dairy cows. \r\n\r\nDuring the dry season, farmers are forced to send their animals to far away locations with greener pastures. This creates a shortage of income from milk due to the 'migration' of the animals. The more expensive alternative to sending away animals is introducing zero-grazing. For zero-grazing to be implemented, however, cows have to have shelter. \r\n\r\nJames is seeking a KES40,000 loan to construct a cowshed.

tiene 2 hijos varones de 19 y 22 a\u00f1os, y su negocio es la panader\u00eda.\nElla es buena madre, independiente, constante, paciente, responsable y trabajadora. Su negocio lo desarrolla en la zona central un lugar caracterizada por el comercio y manufactura en todos los rubros, donde; restaurantes, librer\u00edas, hoteles, mercados, oficinas, galer\u00edas, universidades, etc., conviven lado a lado, de clima c\u00e1lido tropical con una temperatura que var\u00eda durante el d\u00eda entre 22 \u2013 35 grados cent\u00edgrados.\nRufina es de tez morena, cabello negro largo lo usa amarrado, ojos pardos, baja estatura, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica mediana, viste a la moda, su lengua materna es el Guaran\u00ed que habla en familia y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y por el negocio que realiza (sentada a la derecha, usa blusa amarilla). Su vida la comparte con su pareja que se dedica al mismo negocio y con sus hijos que estudian y trabajan, viven en un cuarto propio construida de ladrillo y cemento con techo de calamina que cuenta con agua potable, energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y alcantarillado. La necesidad por abastecer las necesidades de su familia la impuls\u00f3 a formar una banca de personas con negocios como; venta de comida, taller mec\u00e1nico, venta de ropa de segunda mano, salte\u00f1er\u00eda, venta de cosm\u00e9ticos por cat\u00e1logo, venta de chamarras y tienda de barrio, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y ampliar sus actividades. Su negocio es la panader\u00eda. El olor a pan fresco domina el \u00e1rea, proviene de la panader\u00eda m\u00e1s popular del lugar, el suelo est\u00e1 lleno de cientos de panes y canastas; en el medio se distingue a la panadera, que muestra los reci\u00e9n horneados cu\u00f1ap\u00e9s que son elaboradas con harina de arroz, queso y manteca; \u201cmi pasi\u00f3n por las pastas me ha hecho conocer con todo el barrio, mi siguiente meta es abrir un restaurante\u2026\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que es constante al igual que los clientes, la desventaja es la distancia del lugar ya que debe viajar a comprar los ingredientes como harina y queso. Su sue\u00f1o es abrir un restaurante, ella desea realizar la compra de insumos de cocina como harina, arroz, fideo y otros para abrir un puesto de venta de comida y ampliar su panader\u00eda. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 10 a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta labor de forma independiente. \nEs por esos motivos que Rufina solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de variedades de harinas para hornear e insumos de cocina para abrir un puesto de venta de comida.\n","en":"Rufina is a 46-year old woman who lives with her partner, with whom she has 2 sons aged 19 and 22. She has a bakery and is a good mother, independent, constant, patient, responsible and hard-working. She works in the center of a place characterized for the trade and industry in all kind of jobs, where restaurants, book stores, hotels, markets, offices, galleries and universities live next to each other. The weather is tropical with a temperature that varies between 22 and 35 \u00baC. \r\n\r\nRufina has dark skin, long and dark hair in a ponytale, dun eyes, short height and medium complexity. She follows fashion tendencies and her mother tongue is the Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks at home. She also speaks Spanish for general culture and for her business. She is one wearing yellow at the right side of the picture. \r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her partner, who works in the same business, and with their children, who study and work. They live in their own house, made of brick and cement with a ceiling of corrugated iron. They have drinking water, electric power and sewage system. The need to cover their household expenses motivated her to create a group of people in different businesses: food sales, mechanic garage, second-hand clothing sales, cosmetic sales by catalogue, coat sales and grocery store, to request a loan and expand their activities. She has a bakery and the smell of fresh bread dominates the area. Hers is the most popular bakery in the area and the floor is full of bread and baskets. The baker shows the fresh \"cu\u00f1apes\", made of rice flour, cheese and butter. \r\n\r\n\"My passion for the pastries has allowed me to meet everyone in the neighborhood. My next goal is to open a restaurant...\", she says. The advantage of her business is that is constant, as well as her clients. The disadvantage is that she needs to go far away to buy ingredients, such as flour and cheese. Her dream is to open a restaurant and to buy ingredients, such as flour, rice, noodles and others to start a food stand and expand the bakery. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with the institution in 10 years running the business. Rufina is requesing a loan to buy different types of flour to bake and ingredients for the food stand. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4650,"image":{"id":1845690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy various types of baking flours and ingredients to open a food stand.

She has 3 children aged 12, 10 and 5 years old. Her business is making desserts. She is a good mother, enterprising, independent, active, consistent, responsible and hard-working. <br \/><br \/>She does her business in the \"Plan 3000\" neighborhood of the city. The inhabitants are immigrants of the Ayorea native tribes of the area and miners relocated from the West who settled in the area and their decedents generated the manufacturing and commerce of all types. The climate is hot, tropical and very humid with a temperature that varies during the day between 21 to 32 degrees Celsius. <br \/><br \/>Maria is dark-skinned, with dark eyes, long black hair that she ties back, is short in stature and robust in build. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks in her family and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and for her business. She shares her life with her husband who works as a metal worker and her children who study in school. They live in a room that they built themselves of brick and cement with a metal roof. It has running water, electricity and sewage. <br \/><br \/>Her business is making and selling desserts like ice-cream and different flavors of jello, flan, etc. \"I started my business with a minimum investment and kept investing my profits in my business and expanding my products\" she comments. Her advantage is that the climate makes her sales higher, her disadvantage is the lack of capital to diversify her product. Her dream is to have a large and well-known business in order to sell wholesale. <br \/><br \/>She wants to expand her business by buying a freezer to offer new products and to generate greater sales. This is her first loan with the institution in the 3 years she has been involved in this activity. For these reasons Maria is requesting a loan to buy a freezer to produce a greater quantity of desserts and sell

On the farm, he also has poultry, goats and a garden filled with maize crops. Apart from farming, James, who is a pensioner, also makes money from his carpentry skills. \r\n\r\nThis year, James is on a mission to grow and diversify his business. He is seeking a loan to pay for a grain milling machine. The market demand for flour is huge. Most end consumers choose flour, as opposed to grains, because flour assumes a form that can be used to prepare a wide variety of meals. With your loan, James will use the grain mill to process his grain and offer the same service to other farmers at an affordable fee. Income from the grain mill will be used by James to service the loan and ultimately improve his family's income.

She is grateful to Kiva for helping her with financing. She currently owns two cows, and sells milk on a daily basis. Farming has become her family's primary activity. She raises beans and clover on 1.20 hectares. The business she has developed earns a monthly income of around 6,000 som (KGS).

Animals on the farm have been given the names of \"Gatune\".\r\n\r\nLucyline is seeking a loan from Kiva, through Juhudi Kilimo, to purchase a dairy cow. The additional cow will produce more milk for sales, increasing milk volume. Typical grade cows produce 10 to 15 litres of milk on average per day. Lucyline stated that what is most enjoyable about farming is that it generates income! Her biggest challenge is a lack of capital. \r\n\r\nLucyline was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, \"It focuses on improving the lives of people in rural areas.\" This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session, to which she replied, \"It is flexible and accessible.\"\r\n\r\nLucyline's highest monthly expense is farming costs.
