He lives with his family in Mbarara town, but is originally from Isingiro in Western Uganda. \n\nBoaz started out in business as an entrepreneur selling essential commodities in his grocery store. Having finished junior high school, he later went on to acquire a diploma in Business. Noticing the plight of children in his community who were orphaned due to AIDS, he founded a Non-Government Organization (NGO) aimed at empowering AIDS affected families and other vulnerable households to live a better life. \n\nThrough his community development projects, he realized that there was a need for life changing technologies in the most vulnerable households to enable them live a better life. With this in mind, he started researching and collaborating with social enterprises that had a component of social responsibility in the areas of clean energy, environment conservation plus food and nutrition security. Through this research he built partnerships with solar and improved cook stoves distribution companies. While doing this, he was introduced to the improved cook stove business, having visited the UpEnergy stall, during an energy exhibition week. Realizing that product demand was high, and that he enjoyed selling energy-efficient stoves a lot, Boaz decided to become an UpEnergy distribution partner as well. He went on to register a social enterprise that enables local communities gain access to life changing technologies. And ever since then, he has been successfully selling UpEnergy products for the last four years. He attributes his success to the healthy margins and the ability to acquire small volumes of products on consignment from UpEnergy, a reason why he appreciates the well managed operations at UpEnergy. \n\nAside from earning a living through product sales, for Boaz the life changing testimonies and experience of the women who have been able to switch from using hazardous methods of cooking and lighting, makes him feel proud of not only himself, but his entire community. He is also proud to be able to improve the livelihoods of people in the communities who are able to save from improved fuel use. These savings are being channeled to other expenses like school fees for children and housing expenses. His aspiration is to set up an energy center where people in his community will be able to access information on energy related products and environmental conservation.

He is 38 years old, married, and the father of six children, aged between 4 and 17, of whom three are attending school. His wife warehouses grain for resale. \r\n\r\n Mamadou raises cattle. He is taking out the loan with RMCR to buy a lot of cattle feed (feed cakes, salt, millet bran) to feed his cattle. He stocks up at nearby weekly markets and resells the cattle in a neighborhing country (R.C.I.) He has five years of experience in this business. \r\n\r\nIn his sales, he earns on average 20,000 F CFA of profit per head of cattle. With the profit Mamadou can cater for his family's needs (clothing, healthcare, and school fees). He is often confronted with difficulties in crossing over borders and the expensive costs relative to transporting cattle, but he usually manages to make the trip with other livestock-raisers from his area so as to meet these challenges. \r\n\r\nIn future, Mamdou would like to take out a higher loan amount to develop his livestock-raising activity and earn more profit so that he can buy a residential plot in town and then build on it for his family.

The profits from the business will be used to buy a piece of land.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She works hard every day and she is pretty sure that she is closer to reaching her goals.\r\n\r\nSusan owns a variety store.

She gets her product from a wholesaler at a lower price then she sells it per piece for a higher price to have profit.\r\n\r\nSusan desires to manage a bigger store someday, so she is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan, which she will use to buy additional groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She also looks forward to seeing her children finish their studies through all her hard work and perseverance.\r\n\r\nSusan meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married with one child aged 9 months, not yet in school.\r\n\r\nShe is a farmer, and she has been growing maize for the past eight years, while her husband is a businessman. With the loan from Kiva, she would like to pay workers who harvested maize. \r\n\r\nThe profits from the business will be used to renovate her house.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

According to Juhudi Kilimo, buying more land represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled.\n\nIn the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household.

She has a college degree in economics.  Since 2003, she has been selling carpets from Turkey as well as curtains manufactured in China.  When she started, many years ago, she only had a capital of 100,000 som (KGS).  Today, she has a well developed business.  Eliza leases a retail outlet and warehouse for 30,000 som (KGS) per month.  She currently makes a monthly income of up to 50,000 som (KGS).

She is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities which constitute her family's main source of income and which she started in 2003.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has one cow, two horses and 10 sheep on her farm.  She grows potatoes and beans for resale on 1.74 hectare of land.  She makes a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS), which is not enough for a decent living.  For this reason, and in order to grow her farming business, Kenzhebubu has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy one cow.

She also grows beans, corn, pepper and potatoes on 1.6 hectare of her own land and 2 hectares of leased land.  Eager to further grow her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy four calves for fattening and resale.

They have a two-year-old son and a four-year-old daughter.  Her business is in agriculture.  <br \/><br \/>Eugenia is a good mother who is understanding, attentive, responsible, hardworking, and a good listener.  She conducts her business in Villa Tunari, which is 160 kilometers northeast of the city.  The businesses in the area are divided up among hotels, restaurants, Internet caf\u00e9s, and general stores.  This area also offers extreme sports, such as rafting and paragliding.  The weather is rainy and warm, with temperatures that can reach 35 degrees Celsius.  <br \/><br \/>Eugenia has a dark complexion, long black braided hair, brown eyes, a short stature, and a thin physique.  She wears traditional apparel (hat, shawl, and skirt).  Her native language is Quechua, which she speaks in her town, but she also speaks Spanish as part of the general culture and to conduct her business.  Eugenia shares her life with her partner, who also works in agriculture, and their two children who are not of school age.  They live in a brick and cement house with a metal sheet roof.  Their home receives well water and electricity.  Her business is in agriculture.  She works the land and plants a variety of vegetables such as carrots, lettuce, squash, cucumbers, and other produce.  Eugenia plants her crops according to the change in season.  \u201cI have worked in agriculture my entire life.  I now work with my partner and together we cultivate our crops,\u201d she says.  The place where she lives is in an area where not everyone has basic services.  She previously had to collect water from a stream, but later on, she and her partner built a well where they now get their water.  Now that she has water for her home, she is able to establish a running water connection.  <br \/><br \/>The advantage of her business is that the land is fertile, so she is able to harvest everything she plants.  The disadvantage she faces is the lack of basic services.  Her dream is to finish the construction of her house.  She wants to install a water connection to her kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room so that her children can grow up in better living conditions.  This is her first loan cycle with Emprender.  Eugenia has been working independently at her business for five years.  <br \/><br \/>For the reasons previously stated, Eugenia is requesting a loan so that she can establish a water connection to her kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room in order for her children to grow up in better conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1846954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to establish a water connection to her kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-04-02T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-02T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-13T04:00:00Z","amount":460.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T04:00:00Z","amount":545.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T04:00:00Z","amount":543.85},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T04:00:00Z","amount":551.64},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T04:00:00Z","amount":573.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T04:00:00Z","amount":579.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":591.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T04:00:00Z","amount":606.16},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T04:00:00Z","amount":618.59},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T04:00:00Z","amount":629.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T04:00:00Z","amount":639.74},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T04:00:00Z","amount":659.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.63},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.81},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.68},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.41,"local_amount":460.36,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":465.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564604},{"amount":79.91,"local_amount":545.7,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":552.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046566},{"amount":82.84,"local_amount":565.77,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:46Z","rounded_local_amount":572.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344387},{"amount":79.19,"local_amount":540.84,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":547.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554601},{"amount":82.39,"local_amount":562.63,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":569.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468702},{"amount":633.26,"local_amount":4324.7,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4375.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296553}],"funded_date":"2015-04-09T01:54:25Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":862459,"name":"Maruja Liliana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maruja tiene 46 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en casa familiar con su hijo en el distrito de Oyot\u00fan, una comunidad donde los pobladores se dedican principalmente a la agricultura, comercio y crianza de animales, y se encuentra ubicada en la provincia de Chiclayo, regi\u00f3n Lambayeque, en la costa norte de Per\u00fa. \n<p>\nElla se dedica a la crianza y venta de animales de corral como pollos, gallinas, patos, pavos, entre otros, hace 08 a\u00f1os se dedica a esta actividad por lo que cuenta con experiencia en el sector.

He has two sons, ages six and three, and his business is agriculture. \r\n\r\nHe is a good father, and he is generous, persevering, enterprising, independent, responsible, and hardworking.  He carries out his business in the locality of the \u201cChapare\u201d, a rural area where fruits and vegetables are produced and livestock is raised.  The houses in the area are rustic, and most are without basic services. They are the farmers\u2019 houses, which they use when they are harvesting their crops to sell in the city. Its climate is mild, with temperatures that vary between 18 and 27 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has tan skin, short black hair, and dark eyes. He is short of stature, and slightly built. His maternal language is Quechua, which he speaks at home; he speaks Spanish with the general public and for business.  He shares his life with his partner, who works the land, and with his sons\u2014the eldest, who is studying in school, and the youngest, who is not yet school-age.  They live in their own house, built of adobe and wood, with a corrugated iron roof, and electricity. To get water, they must go to the stream, which is ten minutes\u2019 walking distance.\r\n\r\nHis business is agriculture, specifically, the production of potatoes, wheat, quinoa, barley, broad beans, peas, and grains. He also has sheep.  \u201cBefore, I lived in the town; upon seeing that agriculture was generating good income, I moved to the country\u2026\u201d he says.  The advantage of his business is that all of his production sells; the disadvantage is that he doesn\u2019t have access to basic services in the town where he lives.  His dream is to have all the basic services in his home; he wants to install a potable water connection in his kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room, in order to offer his family a safe home.  This is his first loan with the institution in the ten years that he has been doing this work. \r\n\r\nThat is why Jos\u00e9 is requesting a loan: for the installation of potable water in his kitchen,

He is married with three children between 4 and 18 years old and they all go to school. He is a farmer and has been growing maize for 25 years. His wife is also a farmer. With the loan from Kiva, he would like to pay workers who harvest maize. The profits from the business will be used to renovate his house.<br \/><br \/>The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

She worked for Cox Radio Inc., Reagan National Advertising, and Sinclair Broadcasting, but she then got the idea to venture out on her own as a small business owner. Operating out of San Antonio\u2019s Westside, Veronica created The Social Being: Meetings & Media Firm in 2011. The company is a full service digital marketing and event management firm that helps brand others' businesses, especially small businesses.\r\n\r\nThe Social Being provides social media marketing plans, website development, search engine optimization, and offers training classes for digital marketing. The Social Being specializes in making social media understandable and accessible to all small business owners since a strong marketing plan provides the means to a healthy business.\r\n\r\nVeronica earned a Bachelor of Arts in Communications from the University of Texas at San Antonio. In addition to being the CEO and founder of The Social Being, she teaches web design and development at Sanford Brown College.\r\n\r\nShe came to LiftFund because she is seeking to expand her business. Currently, she is buying the office space next to hers and combining it with her original space for her growing business and staff.

Highland town of Chichicastenango in Guatemala. There are eleven women who live here who have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cFlores de Chontola\u201d or \u201cFlowers of Chontola\u201d. They share an enthusiastic spirit and an optimistic outlook. The majority of them work in traditional textile production.\r\n\r\nHerminia is a 39-year-old member of the Trust Bank with eight children. Although she only was able to attend school for a year, she has a lot of drive and vision to empower herself, raise the standard of living for her family, and provide education for her children. Herminia prepares and sells delicious snacks during the week, delivering them to the homes of her customers. She also has an orchard where she grows apples and peaches and sells her fruit in her community on market days. Herminia is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase ingredients and supplies for her snacks as well as insecticides and other materials for her orchard.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for a woman like Herminia to walk into a Bank in her area to secure a loan.

The Trust Bank, made up of eight women, is located in a rural area of Chichicastenango in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. The ladies are involved in various commercial enterprises including traditional textile production and fruit (apples, peaches, plums) production and sales. They sell both inside and outside of their community. The women have increased their income and have invested additional funds to expand their businesses, add an additional business, or been able to meet the financial obligations in their families. Sometimes, they are able to realize all three goals.\r\n\r\nCristina is a hard-working businesswoman who has a textile business. She creates various traditional garments like \u201chuipiles\u201d or beautiful emboidered\/woven women\u2019s blouses and shawls that she sells in the large market of Chichicastenango. Cristina has requested a loan that she will use to purchase three kinds of thread and other supplies for her business. Her short-term goal is to earn enough to pay back the loan and request an additional loan, create more textiles that are even finer and of higher quality, and attract more customers. \r\n\r\nThe \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of Friendship Bridge, that combines education and loans, is truly effective for the women. Each month at their meetings, a Loan Officer from the organization shares beneficial information with the ladies, many of whom have had little or no education. Some of the topics covered include nutrition, health, hygiene and the use of medicinal plants as well as self-esteem, empowerment and goals\/dreams. The women also learn about effective business practices.\r\n\r\nKIVA investors are valuable and much-appreciated in funding loans for these women. The ladies are poised to step into a brighter tomorrow, benefiting themselves, their families, and their community in rural Chichicastenango."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2613.17,"image":{"id":1846999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To purchase three kinds of thread and other supplies for her textile business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Chichicastenango, Departamento El Quiche","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-04-02T15:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-02T15:30:13Z","loan_amount":4100,"lender_count":143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pascuala ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina Marisela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebastiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":31200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":4100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2840.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2840.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2840.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2840.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2840.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2840.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2840.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2840.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2840.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2840.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2792}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.31},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.31},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.31},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.31},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.31},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.31},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":373.31},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":373.31},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":373.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":373.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":373.31,"local_amount":2840.8,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2850.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649567071},{"amount":373.31,"local_amount":2840.8,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2850.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665049227},{"amount":373.31,"local_amount":2840.8,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:47:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2850.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347086},{"amount":373.31,"local_amount":2840.8,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2850.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696557443},{"amount":373.31,"local_amount":2840.8,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2850.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711472403},{"amount":373.31,"local_amount":2840.8,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2850.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730991490},{"amount":373.31,"local_amount":2840.8,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2850.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752079758}],"funded_date":"2015-04-05T12:59:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":862468,"name":"Nh\u00f3m 02 - Th\u00f4n Thu\u1eadn17 - X\u00e3 Qu\u1ea3ng Nham Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs H\u1eefu operates a food stall\/restaurant selling cakes, sweets, sugar, milk, etc. She is requesting a loan to purchase more of these items to sell.

She, together with her family, manages their household while operating the business. They are working hand in hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLeticia owns and oversees operations of their jeepney transportation business. She has one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which are paying a boundary* (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 700 every day.\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 40,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nLeticia desires to buy more units of jeepney which she can also use for their transportation business. She aims to save for a new house and lot for her family. She meets up with her co-fellowship members** to share stories of her life and business every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nThe ubiquitous jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines, the Philippines. Interestingly, they were of purely American origins. They were first used by GIs in helping the Filipinos in the fight against the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn a living. The Jeeps were modified into 20-seater jeepneys, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.\r\n\r\n* In the boundary system, the driver pays the jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

She and her family live in a community of Solol\u00e1. With the goal of earning money to support her family, Ana is in the business of buying and selling ladies' shoes. She's run this business for about ten years, and she chose this field because it provides good income.\r\n\r\nFor Ana Maribel, there is a little demand at this time of year because many people are looking for good quality shoes at a good price. That's why now is the time for her to stock her business. Her difficulty is that she doesn't have enough capital to make this investment. But she's an optimistic woman and she thought of requesting this loan to buy various kinds of shoes: pumps, peep toes, sandals, ballet flats, and clogs.\r\n\r\nAna Maribel's ultimate goal is that her business continue to prosper, thus enabling her to increase her income.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":263.02,"image":{"id":1847670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"stock her shoe store with the latest styles","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2015-04-02T19:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-02T19:10:06Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":277.78},{"due_date":"2016-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":277.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.55,"local_amount":278.14,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":286.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649489778},{"amount":37.8,"local_amount":280,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":288.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664972214},{"amount":37.41,"local_amount":277.08,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:17:59Z","rounded_local_amount":285.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681267761},{"amount":37.74,"local_amount":279.53,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:15:40Z","rounded_local_amount":288.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696477565},{"amount":37.53,"local_amount":278,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":286.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711385213},{"amount":37.48,"local_amount":277.63,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":286.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731215313},{"amount":37.51,"local_amount":277.82,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:15:41Z","rounded_local_amount":286.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752000810}],"funded_date":"2015-04-22T14:42:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":862571,"name":"Nufaika Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehema, who is in her early 50s is a widow with three kids who are still in school.

He has been working for 6 years in this institution and he comments that he started this work thanks to his desire to help people in different areas.

He's married, and lives in a rural village with his family.  To be able to have a source of income for living expenses, Norqul operates his own business.  For 10 years, he's earned his living growing crops and onions as well.  After collecting his harvest, he takes it to a big bazaar and sells it there.  He used to be a dekhan farmer, and later on decided to sell his own harvest.  \n\nNorqul also has an extra source of income from another kind of business.  He has a few heads of livestock which he raises for eventual resale.  But at the moment, Norqul wants to expand his business; namely, his crop-growing business, but currently lacks the money to buy seeds for sowing.  For this reason, he's turned to Arvand and wants to take out a loan to buy seeds for sowing.  Norqul is counting on a positive outcome, and thanks Arvand in advance for their support.      \n\n
