He learned about Ruma from one of Ruma\u2019s sales executives who came to his stall and he decided to join Ruma because he wanted to learn about how to expand his business in another sector, which is technology.  \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Andi needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits and provide more bill payment services to his community. Andi\u2019s goal towards Ruma in the near future is to serve as an e-commerce business for his community using Ruma\u2019s latest product called Mapan. As seen in the photo, Andi is the one who is standing in his stall. He is thankful for your kind support.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1847252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to increase his daily revenue by selling mobile airtime credits to his community ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Majalengka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-04-02T21:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-02T21:30:06Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":12000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":862888,"name":"Consuelo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Consuelo es una carism\u00e1tica, tierna y muy pujante mujer de 57 a\u00f1os de edad, es separada de su esposo y desde el a\u00f1o 2014 inicio un negocio de confecci\u00f3n de l\u00ednea propia y terceros, su experiencia la obtuvo trabajando en empleos similares donde recib\u00eda un bajo sueldo y decidi\u00f3 emprenderse para buscar mayor calidad de vida.\nElla es madre de 4 hijos y es una de las razones fuertes por las que busco una manera para trabajar desde casa, ahora sue\u00f1a, trabaja por ser una mejor empresaria, por auto superaci\u00f3n, sin olvidar la necesidad y un principio fundamental de  humildad.\nElla quiere constituir una enorme empresa para comprar una vivienda propia y dejarles en un futuro una buena herencia a sus hijos pues no sabe cu\u00e1ndo pueda ella faltar, entonces aprovechara en vida para trabajar en post de ellos.\nLa confecci\u00f3n a terceros es con lo que ha podido sostener a su familia y ahora busca un apoyo financiero para complementar estos recursos que obtiene, confeccionando su l\u00ednea propia, es por ello que con el auxilio financiero desea comprar telas, broches, adornos para confeccionar sus pijamas, ropa interior y sus blusas.\n","en":"Consuelo is a charismatic, tender and very vigorous 57 year old.

That is why Irvan decided to start selling Nazava Water Filters that enable people to filter their well, rain or tap water so it becomes safe to drink without the need of boiling and without needing electricity. \n\nIrvan has a big network and learned trading from his father. Irvan has been active as a Water Filter re-seller for less than a year but he has shown to be a highly effective salesman. Irvan's filter business has shown exceptional growth.\nThe first loan helped Irvan to start his business. Now he is working with one employee and three sub-agents.

She buys mineral water in containers from wholesalers, and sell it per container (5 gallons per container) for a profit. She also earns additional income by selling Vita-Plus natural juice. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan which she will use to buy more stocks of mineral water to expand her product. She is positive for a good return on her investment and she is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her for it will surely help cover her family's daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nConsolacion aims to have a bigger place to expand her business. She prays for good health and a loving family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

He has three sons, ages seven, five, and one; and two daughters, ages six and two.

He carries out his work in the \u201cChapare\u201d, which is the region with the greatest number of parks and nature preserves, and where there are places for adventures, such as navigating the rapids of the Esp\u00edritu Santo River in a raft or kayak; experiencing gravity and space on a rappelling and canopy tour; or discovering remote hiking areas. \r\n\r\nWilder has tanned skin, brown eyes, short black hair, a short stature, and a slight build. His mother tongue is Quechua, which he speaks at home; he speaks Spanish with the general public and for his work. He enjoys his life with his partner, who works in farming, and with their children.  The three eldest are studying in school and the two youngest are not yet school-age. They live in their own house, built of brick and cement, with a corrugated iron roof, and electricity. To get water they must go to the river, which is a ten-minutes\u2019 walk distance.\r\n\r\nHis work is farming, and his most important crops are banana, hearts of palm, pineapple, citrus fruit, and coca.  He works from the very early dawn hours until the daylight fades. He says, \u201cThe field must be cut every day because the jungle sprouts up daily and ruins the plantings\u2026\u201d  The advantage of his work is that he sells his whole harvest to wholesale buyers that take care of distributing it to different markets and shops in the city, and the disadvantage is that his wife takes care of the children and cannot help all the time.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to give his family potable water service in their home. He wants to install the potable water connection in his kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room, so that his family won\u2019t have to walk to the river. \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with the institution in the six years that he has been cultivating the land.

dificultades de capital, Jorge ha tenido que rechazar algunos pedidos de sus clientes por la poca capacidad para conseguir las materias primas necesarias. \n\nCon el \u00e1nimo de mejorar esta condici\u00f3n, Jorge aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de materias primas como madera, pegante, clavos, entre otros, para la fabricaci\u00f3n de grandes pedidos de sus clientes. \n\nJorge aspira que el pr\u00e9stamo le permita elaborar estos pedidos sin que se afecten sus ingresos mensuales. \n\n\n","en":"Jorge has been a carpenter for a large part of

He wants to purchase working materials, such as metallic sheets, steel tubes, paints, and other, to continue with his occupation. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in the 2 years that he has had this occupation.\r\nIt is for these reasons that Miguel asks for a loan, for the purchase of working materials for the production of traffic signs to continue with his business. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":394.03,"image":{"id":1846866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase work materials for the production of traffic signs to continue with his business.

She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo increase her sales, Maria would like to avail herself of a loan amounting to 8,000 PHP (Philippines pesos). She will buy additional raw products like pork and chicken, and seasonings that are needed. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nShe meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1847402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw ingredients, seasonings and other materials needed in her food stall business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-04-03T12:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-03T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.69,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2987.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536415},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2987.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017630},{"amount":39.99,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1792.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314047},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1066.71,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1194.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522750}],"funded_date":"2015-04-03T12:47:17Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":862911,"name":"Ana Marisol","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana, es una mujer muy luchadora, por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos no fue a la escuela; est\u00e1  casada y su esposo vive en Estados Unidos, tiene una hija que actualmente est\u00e1 estudiando noveno grado.\n\nAna, tiene una tienda y lo ha administrado desde hace 4 a\u00f1os, fue su madre quien la motivo a que invirtiera en un negocio, con lo poco que su esposo le enviaba; fue as\u00ed como ella opto por colocar una tienda en su casa.- Antes, \u00fanicamente se dedicaba a los quehaceres del hogar, su hija despu\u00e9s de salir de clase le ayuda a atender a los clientes.\n\nElla solicita el cr\u00e9dito para invertir m\u00e1s en su tienda, espec\u00edficamente comprara arroz, frijoles, az\u00facar, jab\u00f3n, detergente, entre otros.

She carries out her business in the \u2018plan 3000\u2019 area, which is characterized by being the production area of the city, where micro-entrepreneurs in areas such as sewing, design and artisan products reproduce foreign products so that they can be sold in the main local markets. It is the most populous district in the place, and the climate is warm and tropical with a temperature that varies between 21 and 32 degrees centigrade. \r\n\r\nRosa has a dark complexion, is of short stature, has long black hair which she ties up, brown eyes and a medium body type. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks with her family. She speaks Spanish at a general knowledge level and to run her business. She carries out her life in the company of her family, who have their own house built of brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof, running water, electricity and a sewer system. \r\n\r\nShe has a business selling flip-flops and clothes for all ages. The clothing items that she offers the most are: flip-flops in all colors and sizes, short-sleeved t-shirts, short trousers, Bermuda shorts and other items. Most of her merchandise is summer clothing because the climate is warm nearly all year round. \r\n\r\nRosa says: \"Here it is very hot and the clothing that is used is mostly short summer clothing. Sales are good and constant\u2026\u201d.  The advantage of her business is that the clothes are sold quickly. The disadvantage is that fashion changes clothing designs. Her dream is to open branches and sell wholesale. \r\n\r\nShe wants to repair the roof of her business to prevent water leaks from ruining her merchandise, which is why she is asking for a loan. This is her first loan sequence with the institution in the two years that she has been developing this business. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1846941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to repair the roof of her business to prevent water from ruining her merchandise ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-04-03T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-03T14:10:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-27T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-13T04:00:00Z","amount":135.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T04:00:00Z","amount":300.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T04:00:00Z","amount":293.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T04:00:00Z","amount":306.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T04:00:00Z","amount":328.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T04:00:00Z","amount":318.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":371.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T04:00:00Z","amount":365.02},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T04:00:00Z","amount":374.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T04:00:00Z","amount":409.41},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T04:00:00Z","amount":399.34},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T04:00:00Z","amount":447.45},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T04:00:00Z","amount":461.02},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T04:00:00Z","amount":476.44},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T04:00:00Z","amount":490.99},{"due_date":"2016-07-12T04:00:00Z","amount":519.71},{"due_date":"2016-08-12T04:00:00Z","amount":538.21},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T04:00:00Z","amount":462.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.95},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.04},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.37},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.95},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.47},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.51},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.76},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.9},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.1},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.81},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.9,"local_amount":135.91,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":137.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564603},{"amount":43.95,"local_amount":300.16,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":303.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046565},{"amount":43.04,"local_amount":293.9,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:46Z","rounded_local_amount":297.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344386},{"amount":44.92,"local_amount":306.8,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":310.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554600},{"amount":48.13,"local_amount":328.72,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":332.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468701},{"amount":825.06,"local_amount":5634.51,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5700.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296552}],"funded_date":"2015-04-23T14:35:05Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jenny Buckland","image":1718323}},{"id":862738,"name":"Urozoi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Urozoi is a bright and cheerful woman.

But due to some financial constraints her husband is not in suitable condition to buy these items for his business purposes. Therefore Sajida has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan amount, she will financially assist her husband in purchasing these tailoring accessories to fulfill his business needs, so that he can earn a more profitable

Her husband is solely responsible to fulfill the needs of the entire family.\r\n\r\nRobina's husband needs to buy different types of tailoring accessories like pieces of cloth, laces, needles and sewing machine accessories. But due to some financial constraints her husband is not in a suitable condition to buy above these items for his business purposes. Therefore, Robina has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan amount, she will financially assist her husband in purchasing these tailoring accessories to fulfill his business needs, so that he can earn a more profitable income.\r\n\r\nFor this financial assistance, Robina is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

They live in a house that they constructed themselves out of brick and cement with a metal roof that has electricity, running water and sewage. <br \/><br \/>Her business is selling food and other basic items like bread, eggs, soft drinks, oil, toilet paper, batteries, cookies, phone cards, toothpaste, etc in her neighborhood store that is open from Monday to Sunday during the day.  \"I started selling itinerantly and later opened a small store\" she comments. Her advantage is that she is one of the few stores that serve the drivers that pass by. Her disadvantage is the long distance that she has to go to stock up. Her dream is to open a mini-supermarket to serve the travelers and drivers. <br \/><br \/>She wants to stock her store with food and and basic use items to serve the drivers and passengers. This is her first loan with the institution in the 10 years she has been in this business. For these reasons Melina is requesting a loan to stock her neighborhood store with food and basic use items to serve the drivers and travelers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1846909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock her neighborhood store with food and basic food items to serve drivers and travelers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-04-03T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-03T17:10:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melina Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-27T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-10T04:00:00Z","amount":255.15},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T04:00:00Z","amount":344.27},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":365.62},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":381.16},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":392.18},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":409.41},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":423.35},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":452.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T04:00:00Z","amount":468.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T04:00:00Z","amount":484.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":509.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":513.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.96},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.23},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.83},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37,"local_amount":255.15,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":255.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564602},{"amount":49.92,"local_amount":344.27,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":344.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046564},{"amount":638.08,"local_amount":4400.58,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4408.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344385}],"funded_date":"2015-04-28T20:44:01Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":860755,"name":"Groupement \"astou\"","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupement \u00bb Astou \u00bb \u00bb rassemble des dames qui s\u2019activent dans le commerce et qui se sont r\u00e9unies afin de pouvoir b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du financement octroy\u00e9 par l\u2019U-IMCEC \u00e0 ce r\u00e9seau de femme.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente, Astou s\u2019active dans le commerce depuis 5 ans.

Fanta is 55 yard old, married, and has six children, of whom one goes to school. She was introduced to farming at a young age and has worked in this domain for more than 48 years. \r\n\r\nFor the past 30 years, she has grown groundnuts on her piece of land, because it is a food that can be eaten directly by the family or it can be used as a sauce base in other meals. Moreover, Fanta explains that groundnut fields are found close to the village, which facilitates the harvest.\r\n\r\nAs a farmer, Fanta must face difficulties, such as the lack of agricultural materials. Fanta has been with myAgro for two years and joined again because of the quality fertilizer they provided. This allowed her to increase her earnings last year. \r\n\r\nThis year, Fanta makes payments to buy myAgro fertilizer to grow groundnuts on her .125 hectares of land.\r\n\r\nFanta hopes to be able to increase her yields, which will help her to ensure the future marriage costs of her sons."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1843590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy myAgro fertilizer to grow groundnuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sicoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-04-03T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-03T17:30:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fousseni ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":119000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":119000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":119000,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":120166.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401490}],"funded_date":"2015-04-03T19:12:36Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T15:28:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lindsay","image":839627}},{"id":862940,"name":"Candelaria Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Candelaria de 34 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su madre, ella se dedica a la venta de ropa interior desde hace varios a\u00f1os, su negocio esta ubicada en el merado municipal y ya tiene clientes establecidos, con lo que obtiene de sus ventas logra solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, ella esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de mas ropa interior para damas y asi tener mejores ingresos para tener una meor calidad de vida.","en":"Candelaria is 34 years old and lives in her own home with her mother.

a 22-year-old young resident of the Shahrituz district. She got married, but her husband went to work in the Russian Federation. He has to support his parents and wife. Sanovbar is currently pregnant. She tries not to do difficult work and protect her future child. Sanovbar wants to find another source of income for the family in case her husband has issues with his work and has to return home.

The population of the township is estimated to be between 50,000-85,000 with approximately 10% living in the actual town. \r\n\r\nThe ladies of this group have successfully completed a loan cycle, funded by KIVA investors, and were able to sustain or expand their small businesses. They are requesting another loan that they hope will be funded by KIVA investors. For this upcoming loan cycle, three of the members are new to the group and quite excited about injecting new capital into their businesses and generating additional income.\r\n\r\nPascuala is the Secretary of the Trust Bank and is a prime example of the positive impact of the Friendship Bridge's \u201cMicrocredit Plus Program\u201d. She is a young 22-year-old woman who only had limited elementary school education because of the lack of resources in her family. Along with her nine siblings, Pascuala had a limited vision of her future, dreams and goals. \r\n\r\nPascuala's business is traditional textile production and she sells the unique and beautiful heavy blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d and belts called \u201cfajas\u201d that are often filled with intricately woven designs and embroidery. With her loan, she now has a local stand where all her textile treasures are displayed for potential customers. Pascuala will use this new loan to buy various kind of thread and produce more textiles. She sells three days each week and she is expanding her business. She would like to offer a larger variety of \u201chuipiles\u201d and \u201cfajas\u201d and expand her own custom designs.\r\n\r\nPascuala is a successful businesswoman, not only because of the loan, but also because she has acquired new knowledge about practical topics such as effective business practices. including budgeting, pricing, marketing, accounting and customer service. She shares knowledge about health, hygiene, women\u2019s rights and violence against women with her family. She also learns about empowerment, self-esteem and realizing goals and

Over 90 percent of the population of Xebaquit suffers from poverty, with a high percentage of the population considered extremely poor. Due to the lack of economic opportunity in the region, many supplement their small subsistence farming by commuting to nearby cities to find business opportunities. <br \/><br \/>Francisca is a twenty-eight-year-old mother of four children, all under the age of ten. Every day of the week, both she and her husband commute to Totonicapan from their small community to sell cell phone accessories. Traveling to Totonicapan allows them to access cell phone accessory suppliers with wholesale prices, as well as a larger client base. For two years, Francisca has built her business, establishing her inventory and gaining knowledge about which products are most popular and have the highest rates of return. <br \/><br \/>Due to her hard work, her three children who are in school have had the opportunity to study and achieve a higher level of education than their mother. By reaching a higher level of education, her children have the chance to break the cycle of poverty. <br \/><br \/>As Francisca continues building business experience and capital, she looks forward to securing a more consistent and stable income. She hopes to achieve this possibility through the purchase of a small storefront, giving potential clients a regular place to find her.<br \/> <br \/>Francisca is applying for a loan with Friendship Bridge to buy the necessary inventory to update her products and compete with the changing market. With this loan, Francisca hopes to continue building her experience and create a more profitable and sustainable business. <br \/><br \/>Beyond providing her children with the education they need to build a better future for themselves, Francisca hopes to improve her quality of life by renovating their small house. With the support of Kiva investors, Francisca will have the opportunity to continue developing her business in order to generate consistent and stable income that will give her children the chance to succeed. <br \/><br \/>Thank you, Kiva investors, for choosing to support Francisca and the hardworking women of her Trust

Tukwatanise group. She is married with three children. She receives income from her children to supplement her monthly earnings. \r\n\r\nAs part of the group, Zamu has applied for a loan of 400,000 Ugandan shillings to buy more dried coffee from villages. She does business from Kyambura, Kichwamba, in the Rubirizi district, and her clients are coffee traders. She is faced with the challenge of bad weather, especially drought, but is ready to succeed through her hard work.

They have 2 children ages 12 and 14.\r\n\r\nHe is a good father, patient, persevering, attentive, generous, responsible and very hardworking. He works in Chapre, a rural village with frequent rain storms and heat waves throughout the year. The area's agriculture centers around the production of fruits and vegetables such as bananas, palm hearts, yuccas and the millenary coca leave.\r\n\r\nWillan has dark skin, eyes and hair, he is short and has a medium built. His mother tongue is Quechua and he also speaks Spanish. His spouse also works in agriculture and his children are in school. He lives in his own house, which was primarily built with wood and has a corrugated iron roof. He has access to electricity but must walk 10 minutes to the river to obtain water. He collects water in buckets and other containers. \r\n\r\nHis main activity is the production of wood for export. His field has trees such as teak and serebo for use in woodwork, as well trees that provide construction wood. The wood extraction is done in a sustainable manner -- for each tree that he cuts, he plants two. The most popular species are cedar, South American oak, cedrelinga, ipe, almond, camaru, garapa and many more. \"Wood production is a long term job. After a tree is planted, it can take about 10 years for it to be used for production, depending on the type of wood\", he says. The advantage of his business is that he sells his production as a whole, the disadvantage is that the field must be taken care of until the end of the production. His dream is to have all of the basic services at his home. He wants to connect drinking water to his kitchen, bathroom and laundry area to provide a more comfortable life to his family. This is his first loan with the institution.

Dougoufana, who is 46 years old, lives in a family of eight children. He stresses that the significance of agriculture has no limits and adds that he farms in order to make a lot of profit. He decided to register with myAgro for a new seeding technology. In his first year with myAgro, he has bought a packet of OPV seeds and fertilizer for growing corn in his 0.5 hectare field. By doing this, he hopes to be able to increase his profits and start raising goats and sheep so he can help his nearest and dearest. The family will then be happy and satisfied."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1844132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy a packet of OPV seeds and fertilizer for growing corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kolonda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-04-04T10:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-04T10:10:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dougoufana ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mahamadou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brehima ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bouroulaye ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karamoko ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Massaoule ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaya","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Bakary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":630000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":630000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":630000,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-20T12:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":630875.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401491}],"funded_date":"2015-04-04T20:39:59Z","paid_date":"2015-07-20T12:14:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":861247,"name":"Desanges Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Justine est commer\u00e7ante, conseill\u00e8re du groupe solidaire \u00abDesanges\u00bb, cliente de l\u2019IMF Hekima, mari\u00e9e \u00e0 un menuisier, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 36 ans, m\u00e8re de 4 enfants tous scolaris\u00e9s.
