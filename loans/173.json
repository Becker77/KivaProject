He spends his time fishing at night and driving a pedicab during the day. Because of Marito's strong desire to see his children finish their studies, along with his wish to quit renting a house and purchase a small home of his own, HSPFI is helping him fulfill his dreams through HSPFI savings and loans.

Don Jorge buys the stale bread that is left over from his wife's work each day, which are collected and wrapped in bags and left to harden. Once there are a few bags of hardened bread, Don Jorge buys them and afterwards carries them back home to grind in a small grinding machine. Later, he sells the crumbs by the hundredweight and pound. Don Jorge is a very reponsible person towards his job and his family.

She sells fruits, sweets, preserved food, juices, soft drinks and many other items in her grocery. \r\n\r\nThe inventory she has for sale is of very good quality and selection. Zebiniso is respectful and patient with all of her customers, which attracts people and brings them back to her vending facility to buy groceries again. \r\n\r\nZebiniso is seeking to keep her business sustainable and has requested a loan of $3,000 to increase the inventory she has for sale.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is originally from Ccatca but currently lives in Huambutio. She has three children; one is already grown and independent, and the other two still depend on her. Alejandrina and her husband Aniceto both help each other at home, and they also have a family business making ceramic tiles.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures, a general store and a fish vending business. Her husband Renaldo C., who is 55 years old, works as a tailor to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between 20 and 30 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Zosima joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $188, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing 17,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more stock that she can sell to customers so that she can continue to save up for future improvements in her business. Ma. Zosima C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The official name of this borrowing group is Lilian B..\r\n\r\nLilian is single. To make a living, Lilian owns & operates a business catching and selling fresh-water fish at the market.

Lilian is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Lilian from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

She offers her customers snacks, <i>tlacoyos<\/i> [oval-shaped fried or toasted cakes made from corn dough], rice tacos, brisket taquitos, flautas, chicken quesadillas, enchiladas, tostadas, <i>pozole<\/i> [traditional stew], and golden tacos.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Very soon she began to fan out to surrounding communities focusing on the quality of her products and good prices.\r\n\r\nToday she wants to expand even more and has chosen the month of December, because not only are the hayacas purchased for resale, but also for immediate consumption, so this is just what she will accomplish, the sales will increase and so will her growth.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to increase her profit in order to be able to continue supporting her daughter and paying for the professional studies that she will begin in 2012. At this time she is asking for a Kiva loan, her first loan that will be made through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy raw materials and supplies in greater volume, in order to obtain discounts, and also to buy a chopper with which to prepare hayacas in a more effective way, and to meet the requests of her clients during these Happy New Year celebrations where everyone shares food and abundance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":925666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She lives with her 40-year old husband Ricardo and together their goal is to get ahead in life. She lives in her parents\u2019 house but is in the process of buying a place of her own.\r\n\r\nMargarita earns her living by renting out her 4-wheeled vehicle. After a long time she had saved enough money to buy the car she had longed for. Now she runs it as a colectivo (shared taxi) in the town of Pucallpa. As a result her income has increased; beforehand she didn\u2019t earn much money from the casual work she was doing.\r\n\r\nMargarita really enjoys being the owner of a taxi as she can travel constantly and enjoy the countryside. She\u2019s been doing this work for three years. The most difficult part for her is getting up very early in the morning in order to keep to the schedule. While the work is hard, she knows that in the long-term it will bring positive results.\r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to buy another vehicle and continue to make progress. This will be her seventh loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she has financial support to keep expanding her business. With the S\/.1000 Margarita is seeking, she will buy spare parts and send her vehicle to the garage for its regular inspection.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":953538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"buy spare parts and have her vehicle serviced","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-21T16:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":151.02},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":159.36},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":171.22},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":177.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":182.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.76},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.63,"local_amount":151.02,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":152.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836358},{"amount":59.76,"local_amount":159.36,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":161.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246139},{"amount":59.53,"local_amount":158.75,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":160.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386155},{"amount":64.21,"local_amount":171.22,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":173.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099249},{"amount":66.6,"local_amount":177.6,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":179.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713396},{"amount":68.27,"local_amount":182.05,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":184.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202285}],"funded_date":"2011-12-23T04:47:18Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":377520,"name":"Tsogzolmaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tsogzolmaa is a 49-year-old widow who lives with her three children, ages 15 to 29.

Most of these women either own a weaving business or a daily consumption store. The women of this group know one and other quite well from their San Juan La Laguna community and expressed determination to prove themselves to their families, their group members, and their microlenders. They were content with being part of a community of \u201cunited women without envy of each other\u201d as Cecilia C. V. put it. \r\n<P>There was consensus that the loans were going to be easy to repay. These loans would allow them primarily to invest in their business for higher future profit. Most women in the weaving industry create guipiles and cortes, the traditional indigenous outfits, to sell in the upcoming June 23rd town fair. Seven of them needed funds to invest in their stores which they hoped to set up near the fair. With more products to sell at once, their profits can be much larger during the peak sales of the festive season. They organized this meeting early precisely because of their hopes to receive their loans before the fair. \r\n<P>Melchora Isabel C. owns a traditional clothing store which focuses on sales to tourists. Thanks to her credit, she has been able to produce enough textiles to sell to an intermediary American friend, who exports to the USA. She hires friends to maintain her production rate and allow her time to continue to study in hopes of achieving the equivalent of a high-school degree. \r\n<P>She, along with five others of this new group, stood out as confident role models who began six years ago with loans of 40 USD and are now receiving loans of up to 400 USD. Most of them are in leadership positions such as group president or secretary. Iris Yolanda I. began without any business whatsoever, and is now the proud owner and manager of a crafts and textile business. Cecilia C. now travels to well-known Antigua, Guatemala, to sell the hammocks she makes in large amounts with the help of the loans. \r\n<P>The primary vision that these dedicated businesswomen share is to provide their children with the clothing, food, and education necessary for them to \u201chave it better off than they did as children\u201d and to go on into their adult life with a head start, as Cecilia C. expressed. Alicia C. Y. emphasized the need for this type of individual effort aided by the loans to collectively help their entire town, region, and soon country, prosper."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4850,"image":{"id":171969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Wholesale purchase of market items.

After the rice farming season, she grows green beans to sell for another source of income and now the crop is growing but she faces difficulty getting water to supply her crop.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in her own house and what she wants most is to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe works in the purchase and sale of used cars.  Even though she is aware that this work is dominated by men, she does not let them overlook her and she does very good sales now that she has enough knowledge about automobiles and is a very reputable seller, something that has made her clients trust her.  What she likes best about her work is talking with her customers and advising them about the car that best suits them.  She has been in this business for 10 years and what she finds most difficult is having to spend the whole day in search of a buyer.  For the future she hopes to increase her business and have more cars to sell.\r\n\r\nThis is Mercedes' third loan with MFP and she knows to pay it on time if she wants to receive other loans.

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Maria has 3 years of experience in this business.  Maria needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maria joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Maria's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Maria T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Don Rogelio lleva 4 a\u00f1os con este negocio por eso comenta que pasa por vaR. desafios como transportar el producto en una camionetita y hacer el gasto diario de gasolina, tambien como la camioneta se usa diario y son distancias grandes las recorre se tiene que hacer el servico seguido de la camioneta y hacer vaR. cambios, otro desafio que encuantra es que los precios suben y el tiene que dar un puco mas caro, si esto pasa don Rogelio sale perdiendo ya que sus clientes le reclaman porque volvio a subir y a el no le conviene porque va perdiendo clientes y los gastos que el hace con su camioneta sigen siendo los mismos \u00f3 mas caro, Don Rogelio dice; \"el prestamo me va beneficiar por medio de los ingresos que vaya teniendo por medio de las ganancias de cada producto que se venda, de esta manera yo pueda mantener a mi familia\" mis metas son engrandecer el negocio hasta poner un local para evitar tantos viajes, como tambien saber elaborar el producto, ya que compro el producto echo, pero no se como prepararlo y que tantas cosas sirven para hacerlo, Don Rogelio tiene 3 hijos, el peque\u00f1o es un ni\u00f1o de tres a\u00f1os, los dos mas grandes estudian la escuela primaria y la secundaria, don Rogelio vive en union libre hace ya 14 a\u00f1os y de edad tiene 46 a\u00f1os, vive en casa propia y su esposa es ama de casa, Los demas compa\u00f1eros de don Rogelio son comerciantes tambien y sus negocios son los siguientes;\n1.-Elidia, tiene un tienda de abarrotes\n2.-Sonia, cria pollos y guajolotes y productos de belleza\n3.-Anastacio, vende frituras chcharrones de cuadro\n4.-Ma Agustina, vende ropa de segunda mano\n5.-Natalia, vende pollos y verdura\n6.-Georgina, tiene un taqueria\n7.-Lilia vende Jarceria.

There are 8 members in the group and they live close to each other. They have known each other for many years and they all trust each other. As a group, they say that they have called themselves by this name because all the names they came up with were already taken, and they liked their chosen name best. The 8 members all run businesses, as is the case with Se\u00f1or Rogelio who runs a business selling cleaning products: 'Suavitel' for laundry, along with 'Clarasol' and 'Fabuloso' for cleaning floors and other surfaces in the home.\r\nDon Rogelio has run this business for 4 years and he tells us that he has faced many challenges, such as transporting the products in his little van; having to pay daily for gas; also as he uses the van daily for travelling long distances he has to take the van for services and pay for maintenance. Another challenge comes from rising costs which means he would have to sell his products at a higher price. If this happens, Don Rogelio ends up operating at a loss as he does not pass on these price rises to his clients. If he keeps on increasing his prices then he will lose his clients, and the costs that he must pay for his van continue to be the same or higher. Don Rogelio says, 'the loan is going to improve the income I receive from the sale of each product, and so I will be able to provide for my family'. His goals are to increase the size of his business until he has his own shop, so that he will not have to make so many journeys, as well as learning how to make the product, as he currently buys the product ready made but does not know how to prepare it and many items are needed to make it. \r\n\r\nDon Rogelio is 46 years old and has three children. The youngest is three years old and his two older children are at primary and secondary school respectively. Don Rogelio has been with his partner for 14 years, they live in their own home and his partner is a housewife. The other members in Don Rogelios group are also businesspeople, and their businesses are as follows:   \r\n\r\n1.-Elidia, runs a general store\r\n2.-Sonia, raises chickens and turkeys and sells beauty products\r\n3.-Anastacio, sells fried snacks\r\n4.-Ma Agustina, sells second hand clothes\r\n5.-Natalia, sells chicken and vegetables\r\n6.-Georgina, sells tacos\r\n7.-Lilia sells domestic products.

concrete.  \r\n\r\nShe is grateful for the support Afodenic, though Kiva funds, provides because without that support it would be impossible for her to make her dream of turning her little house into

He is married and has a seven year old daughter who attends elementary school in the community of Lamai.  Don Reynaldo is a farmer who has engaged in his business for fifteen years.  He works more than eight hours a day, Monday through Sunday.  Due to his financial situation, he was not able to continue his education and only finished school through the sixth grade.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe started his business activites in a traditional manner.  His father had a vegetable farm where he grew tomatoes, cucumbers, and bell peppers.  Reynaldo started planting vegetables at the age of 13.  Afterwards, he continued planting alone because his father became ill and was not able to assist him.  He has spent most of his career planting vegetables in a traditional manner.  Today he plants tobacco.  He has a small parcel of land where he grows tobacco so that he can generate more income.  The products are sold to a trader who exports them to Cuba.  \r\n<p>\r\nReynaldo has to travel almost two hours from Pueblo Nuevo to Estel\u00ed so that he can apply for a loan whenever he has difficulty selling his products outside of the region because he must travel even longer distances.

is 37 years old, is married and has 2 children.  She owns a grocery store, where she sells products needed to make \"chipas\" (which are a typical meal of Paraguay) like flour, cheese, eggs, oil, etc.<p> \r\n\r\nThe products needed to produce chipas make for good sales because Carmen's business is located in an area where chipas are predominantly produced.  Her workday begins very early in the morning, with the purchase of these raw materials from their suppliers.  These suppliers are in the city Eusebio Ayala (Barrero Large). <p>\r\n\r\nCarmen says that this business of selling products for the development of chipas required financial capital and without the loans given to her by the Paraguayan Foundation, she wouldn't have been successful. To be successful in this business, one must have sufficient inventory of the necessary products because the  prices constantly change, hence the profitability constantly changes, which affects the small producers. <p>\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy more goods for sale in her grocery, such as soda, beer, sugar, meat, milk, etc.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Gould, Kiva

They each hope to earn an average  profit of 25,000 francs CFA  per month which would be used to make the loan payments and assist their husbands in meeting family expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by David Gibbons, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":223061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase various small business products such as: wax \"pagne\" (dcorative cloth), fabric (medium quality), firewood, embroidered fabric and locally made soaps.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-11-07T13:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abi  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abi     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:47:29Z","rounded_local_amount":75329.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350983},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":75329.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974081},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":75329.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889454},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":75329.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440247},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":75329.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135615},{"amount":145.85,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":75329.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033416}],"funded_date":"2008-11-11T13:04:20Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":77575,"name":"Maureen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maureen U. is 40 years old and is married with two children.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

She works in agriculture and really likes working with each of her crops, with the leadership of her husband. This season they have planted a large area with potatoes and beans. The potatoes are more profitable, since they can sell them as food and as seed tubers from the same harvest. In the case of food potatoes, she sends them directly to the wholesale market in the city, the most important one in the region. On average, it takes less than half an hour to finish selling a truckload of potatoes. As for the potatoes for seed tuber, she keeps them in storage until buyers from the coast come to her fields. They buy the potatoes by the kilo, and at a good price. This is why Gladys wants to buy more fields, so she can avoid having to pay to rent them. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She is part of a communal bank and she gets on well with the other members because they have all been very welcoming toward her, even though she joined after the rest. She plans to use the money she is requesting to buy chemical fertilizers for her next potato crop. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":403783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-12T00:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2019.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992529}],"funded_date":"2009-10-17T11:50:42Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":147314,"name":"Anabela's Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo de 6 personas llegaron a la Asocici\u00f2n ASDIR  para pedir ayuda, para incrementar  sus capitales ya que ellos se dedican a la compra y venta de ropa tipica, y esto a servido para el mantenimiento coticiano para la susistenicia y ellas quiren seguir apoyando a sus hijos e hijas para tener un mejor nivel de vida y para ello acuden para apoyarles en sus capitales y as\u00ec poder tener m\u00e0s sutido sus mercancia y vender a otros pueblos la ropa tipica.","en":"This group of 6 persons came to the ASDIR Association to ask for help to increase their capital; they are engaged in the business of buying and selling clothes in styles that are typical of the area.

He is married, has two children, and works as a public transport driver.  Unfortunately his income does not cover all of the household expenses so he helps his wife with her beauty product sales business.  Some of the customers are friends and work colleagues.  Many times he accompanies his wife to visit customers and handle payment collection.  This allows them to have extra income so they can enjoy a better quality of life and give their children an education and proper nutrition.  They are thinking about opening another business to sell not only beauty products but other items such as gifts, costume jewelry, etc. out of their home.  The loan will be used to buy beauty products such as make-up, perfumes, talcum powder, shampoo, etc.  They want to take advantage of this time of year when there is more demand because of Christmas parties.  The communal bank \"SIEMPRE ADELANTE\" is comprised of seven members who all live in Ventanilla Callao.\r\n\u2022\tMr. Juan is the one in the yellow shirt.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":925757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy beauty products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Los Olivos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.851111 -76.390556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2011-11-22T08:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Juan Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Juana Enith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Virginia Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Giuseppe Andre","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":1100,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1113.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250751416},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":1100,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:57:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1113.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257158686},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":1100,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:07:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1113.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263288854},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":1100,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:59:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1113.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270010170}],"funded_date":"2011-12-09T11:42:24Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:59:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":365276,"name":"Christopher","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christopher lives in Mombasa, Kenya.

Association members are engaged in a variety of activities, such as selling improved cook stoves, teaching reading and writing to women\u2019s groups, and educating women in their community about family planning.\r\n\r\nKorotoumou is one of nine members of AVEC-Mali who sell solar lamps. She is 47 years old and has six children. In addition to her work with the women\u2019s association, Korotoumou is the matron at a health center in Mopti, and she sells grains. In July, she started selling solar lamps to fisherman, students and farmers, who are reliant on kerosene and flashlights for light. With a solar lamp, her customers can save money. Kerosene and mobile phone charging currently cost about $110 per year; whereas, a solar lamp costs $25 and has a lifetime of about five years. These solar lamps can provide up to 16 hours of light and can charge a mobile phone.\r\n\r\nOn top of being less expensive, solar lamps are more durable and reliable and keep people from stealing mobile phones. \u201cWith a solar lamp, you don\u2019t have to go to a mobile phone charging station and give your phone to someone who may steal your phone or use the call credit you have on your phone,\u201d says Korotoumou.\r\n\r\nOn top of benefiting consumers, selling solar lamps provides income for the women and for the association, AVEC-Mali. The women earn about $2 per lamp that they sell, and the association earns $3, which is then invested in a warehouse to store solar lamp inventory and motorcycles to distribute the products.\r\n\r\nThe solar saleswomen are well organized \u2013 each responsible for her own sales territory. They educate their communities about the benefits of solar lights and generate lamp sales through group meetings and demonstrations at night.\r\n\r\nSince paying for the lamps up front is simply too expensive, the women need working capital. A Kiva loan will allow the group to obtain solar lamp inventory from NOTS Lampe Solaire and pay for it in installments.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1444900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy solar lamp inventory that they will sell in their communities.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Mopti","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":332,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":29050,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Korotoumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":14000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":29050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":14000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":787933,"name":"Kaharou","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Mari\u00e9 \u00e0 une marchande du nom de Kafayath et p\u00e8re de sixi\u00e8me enfants, dont certains scolaris\u00e9s et tous \u00e0 sa charge, Kaharou est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 42 ans.

Lady sells shoes on the sidewalk of Aroma street, which is located in Los Pozos market on the corner of Antonio Vaca Diez in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. She is requesting funds because she doesn\u2019t have a lot of merchandise and she needs credit in order to acquire more shoes for her business.<p>\r\nLady has been working in this area for ten years, and hers is practically a family business since her mother sells shoes next to her and has taught her the business since Lady was young.  There is quite a bit of competition in Lady\u2019s area.

She began her business due to the need for another income as her husband didn\u2019t earn enough and now he is working in Russia. They have a child who is growing each day, as well as their general needs. She began some time ago selling various products and even had a home-made food shop which she had to close because of the increase in the shop\u2019s rent, and because the owners were asking for the shop. So, one of her friends convinced her to sell clothes and offered to take her to places where she could buy clothes at good prices. She followed her friend\u2019s advice and began to sell clothes 2 years ago. Her sales went very well after she got started. She now has a fair number of customers. <P>\r\n\r\nDilorom is asking for 4000 Somoni which she will repay in 10 months, to purchase seasonal garments. She wants to take advantage of the dates and have a more diverse variety of garments for her customers, which will allow her to increase her sales. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets: thus, they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thereby enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child Care","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To build new classrooms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-11T16:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027598},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613599},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010678},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232964},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664755},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105474},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022619},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867868},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757069},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146181}],"funded_date":"2009-03-12T02:44:18Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":98071,"name":"Isma\u00ebl","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Isma\u00ebl N.  est un boutiquier qui vend divers produits il est marie  il g\u00e8re aussi une t\u00e9l\u00e9 centre et est \u00e0 son premier pr\u00eat.

In addition to his wife and small child he is also supporting his parents. \r\n<P>\r\nAs with any business generating income the business of Naim also requires some investments from time to time.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

(0) is a 42-year-old woman living in the town of Foaluga.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To make a living, Asenati owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Asenati has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 200 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Asenati joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Asenati is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Asenati is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Asenati plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

","en":"Born in 1961, Laurence H. has been living for 10 years in the Tokpota neighbourhood of Porto-Novo, the administrative capital of Benin.  Laurence is divorced from her husband and has a school-age child.  Laurence lives alone and is solely responsible for the household expenses.  Laurence attended school up until High School.  When she failed her school year, Laurence began selling foodstuffs (maize, rice, beans, etc.) and has been doing so with great energy for roughly 15 years; this allows her to meet her various needs.  Laurence buys her goods at the Ikpinl\u00e8 food market of Benin, but sells them in Porto-Novo.  Laurence has had a prior loan with Alid\u00e9 which was repaid in full.  Laurence is currently experiencing financial difficulties to purchase and increase her inventory.  Because of this, and in order to better satisfy her customers, Laurence is asking for this, her second loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":478651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy bags of rice and maize.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-01-27T23:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"M.

She is married and has 3 school-aged children. Described as honest and understanding by family and friends, she makes sure to be a role model to her children. To make a living, Arlene owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Arlene has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nArlene joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arlene is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers, seed and other farm inputs. This will be the first loan taken out by Arlene from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

She has had her business for more than 5 years, starting with a small amount of money that she saved to start a business.

She will use the profits to help her children, to save and finish building her house and she is planing to finish her high school studies.\r\n \r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because, she says \"I really like what Esperanza offers\". Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients in general. Her group is located in the rural areas surrounding Hato Mayor, an area where the economy is dominated by agriculture. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and

Alina is a farmer in Vodyanoye village. She grows early tomatoes. Alina has six large greenhouses, where every year she plants 7000 tall tomatoes. She has been working in agriculture for eight years. She has invested about 150,000 hryvnia in her harm.
