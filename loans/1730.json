","en":"Viviana is thirty-four years old and is the owner of a general goods store. She has been running this business for three years and began the business by offering minutes and then eventually recharges and accessories for cell phones, as well as school supplies and other general goods. She varies her merchandise based on the season so that she can respond to the needs and wants of her customers. \r\n\r\nShe is currently requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to purchase two showcases and a variety of merchandise. This will help her to meet her customers' demands, thereby increasing her sales and her profits. This will allow her to ultimately benefit her family, which is comprised of her husband and three children, ages 10, 11 and 12. \r\n\r\nAll her transactions at her business are made with cash, working Mondays to Saturdays from 8am until 8pm. She buys merchandise at specialized department stores in the Barranquilla city center, where she can purchase the goods her customers are requesting.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to grow her business space and to later own her own property. She therefore commits herself to providing quality service to her customers; she organizes her products in an appealing way so as to encourage a greater volume of

She buys supplies, paying cash at markets in the city center, and then sells her finished products to retailers, who are her main customers. \r\n\r\nGisella's goal is to better organize her workshop and then make improvements to her home so that her family - her husband and their five-year-old daughter - will be more comfortable.\r\n\r\nGisella is applying for a Kiva loan, her first from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and will use the funds to purchase raw materials such as thread, wood, and other supplies.

He has a three-year-old son and a five-year-old daughter. He has a business as a metalworker. He is a good father, and he is entrepreneurial, upstanding, responsible, and hardworking. He operates his business in 'Chapare', a rural area with groups of peasants who farm vegetables, fruit, grains, and other things. In this area, there are also large hotels and tourist agencies that offer extreme sports packages, guided visits, or simply relaxation with food and drink. The weather in this area is tropical and warm with a temperature that varies during the day between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nEustaquio is dark-skinned with brown eyes and short black hair. He is short in stature and has a thin physical build. His native language is Quechua which he speaks in his home, and he also speaks Spanish for general purposes and in his business. He shares his life with his partner, who works raising hens, and with his children. His older child is starting school, and the younger one is not old enough yet for school. They live in their own home made of bricks and cement with a roof made of corrugated iron. Their home has electricity, and they must walk 10 minutes to the river to get water in buckets and other containers, which they deposit in barrels for different uses. \r\n\r\nEustaquio's occupation is in metalworking, He makes doors, windows, tables, chairs, counters, etc. He makes everything one can make of metal for domestic use. He works during the day from Monday to Saturday in his shop located at his home. \"I began my business in metalworking because there wasn't anyone else doing this work in the area...\" says Eustaquio. The advantage of his business is that it is the only one and he doesn't have any competition. The disadvantage is the transport of materials that he must bring from the city. His dream is to give his family the basic services so that they live well. He would like to install a potable water system in his kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room so that his family has a safe home to live in. This is his first loan with the institution in 6 years of working in his profession.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Eustaquio is requesting a loan to install a potable water system in his kitchen,

Her eldest sister is working in a mini-grocery store in the Pulupandan public market, while her eldest brother is still in college in Manila. Rhea Lyn is the second in their family, and she's been living with her aunt for six years now.

She also contributes her income, along with her husband, to manage the household. She needs to buy different types of cosmetics and creams, a hair brush, and other accessories for her beauty salon; but due to financial constraints, she is not capable of buying these items for her business purpose.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Shama has applied for a Kiva loan. This loan will help her to buy the relevant items for her business purpose so that she can provide better services to her customers. It will also help her to earn a maximally profitable income to fulfill the needs of her business and family.\r\n\r\nShama is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for this financial

She knew Ruma from a Ruma sales executive coming to her house, and she decided to join Ruma because she wants to learn about how to start up a business. As a young lady, Awalia realized that she has to improve her life, that\u2019s why she always wants to learn anything that is related to business.  <br \/><br \/>As the business grows, Awalia needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits to her community, so her community can easily connect with their loved ones, no matter how far they are apart. Awalia\u2019s goal towards Ruma in the near future is to serve as an e-commerce business for her community, with Ruma\u2019s latest product called Mapan. <br \/><br \/>As seen in the photo, Awalia is the one who is standing in her own stall.

of land in Mugwe, a remote village in the Chuka area of Kenya. Today, this humble mother of five children sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has of farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to her heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow, which makes her very proud.

She lives in the Jilikul district.  She has one son and two daughters.  Her husband is currently working in the Russian Federation as a migrant worker because he couldn't find a suitable job in his own country.  Khuriniso's oldest daughter works as a nurse.  Her son is a student.  Her youngest daughter attends secondary school.\r\n\r\nKhuriniso is a quiet and smart woman.  Five months ago, she learned how to tailor and sew women's clothes.  She likes her work and would now like to start her own business, but she doesn't have enough money to buy a computerized sewing machine of the \"Yamata\" brand as well as other sewing supplies.

She resides in the Tumeiyo village in western Kenya.\r\n\r\nArmed with this conviction, Grace has kept hope and has been toiling on her farm. Her primary sources of income have been milk, poultry, and some \u201cside hustles\u201d she does to supplement the meager income she earns from farming. The Tumeiyo area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a sea of people, but the mill keeps breaking down, so farmers are not able to grind their maize. Grace intends to change this and is requesting a loan to buy an electric posho mill, which will grind corn or maize into flour. \r\n\r\nMaize meal is very common in Tumeiyo village and is a staple food for many communities. Many People living in Tumeiyo Village consume the maize product \u201cugali\u201c (hard porridge) regularly. The market usually provides sifted flour, but the cost is higher because of the sifting and packaging. Cheaper flour can be obtained by milling the maize directly using a posho mill. \r\n\r\nThrough this loan, Grace will be able to grind maize faster because she will use an electric posho mill. Cases of breakdown will be history because electric posho mills are more reliable. This loan will help Grace to change her life and achieve her life's mission of bringing economic development and poverty alleviation to communities in arid and semi-arid areas. Profits from the posho mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan, which Grace promises to fully repay on time. In the next two years, Grace sees herself as an established businesswoman who will be running more than one posho mill in her remote village.

Edna also operates a side hustle business to supplement the meager income she earns. Edna's sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg-selling; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that she faces is delivering to the market on time. \r\n\r\nThe Eldoret area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. That is why Edna is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike, she will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. \r\n\r\nEdna is determined to succeed. Because she is very disciplined with finances, she plans that through accumulated profits, she will be able to provide a secure future for herself, and also for her ageing parents. Edna\u2019s dream is to be financially empowered.

She sells them afterwards at the Zebu market in the urban commune of Antsirabe (around ten kilometers from her house)  which takes place once a week on a Saturday. Cattle raising is a sort of heritage and family tradition which passes from one generation to another.\r\n\r\nThe partnership with Vahatra began four years ago and has allowed her gradually to increase her livestock. With the profits from her activity she has already been able to buy a piece of land, which allows her to grow vegetable and thus supplement, with her own harvest, her large family's nutritional needs.\r\n\r\nHer objective is to succeed in becoming entirely autonomous, while at the same time guaranteeing the material secuirity of all her family. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":35.92,"image":{"id":1845577,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a bull and a pig.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MG","country":"Madagascar","town":"Vinaninkarena","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-20 47","type":"point"}},"partner_id":359,"posted_date":"2015-04-05T15:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-05T15:30:05Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.05,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cecile Georgine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MGA","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":14490},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":14490},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":14490},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":14490},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":14490},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":14490},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":14490},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":14490},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":14490},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1069590}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.14},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.13},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.13},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.13},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.13},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.13},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":378.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5.14,"local_amount":14490,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-24T12:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":15267.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":651332478},{"amount":5.13,"local_amount":14490,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":15267.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665242812},{"amount":5.08,"local_amount":14490,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":15267.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.05,"payment_id":681549566},{"amount":5.13,"local_amount":14490,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":15267.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696755220},{"amount":5.13,"local_amount":14490,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":15267.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711688301},{"amount":5.13,"local_amount":14490,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":15267.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731191531},{"amount":5.13,"local_amount":14490,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-21T13:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":15267.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":754020137}],"funded_date":"2015-04-05T16:50:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":863849,"name":"Ibrahim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ibrahim is a 26-year-old single man from Rafah city.

She is a good mother, enterprising, with good manners, generous, responsible and hard-working. <br \/><br \/>Her business takes place in el Torno\u2019, which is situated 32 km from the city and characterized by land covered with tropical vegetation. It has a great abundance of forests and a diversity of fauna. It is the meeting place for farmers who come to sell their produce. The principal activity is agriculture.

Her native language is Guaran\u00ed and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and for the work she does (she is seated wearing the yellow shirt).

She grows groundnut on her own plot of land, but as a farmer, is faced with difficulties such as the lack of farming materials. She has begun her first year with myAgro and signed up because of the possibility of increasing her yield through the services offered by myAgro and through training and farming techniques. This year Fatoumata has been making payments to buy a packet of OPV seeds and fertilizer for growing groundnut, so she can increase the yield from her 0.0625 hectare plot of land.
