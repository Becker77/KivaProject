Meet Christina, 63 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer, who lives in Saosa, a remote village in Molo. She is happily married and is blessed with an adorable family. She has been practising mixed farming for the last five years and has gained a great deal of experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her family, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has also been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Molo area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable. She states that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 10,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman seeking to access funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved and that she will be able to buy more poultry. As a result of the loan, she will sell more eggs and poultry products to her neighbours and to the local market, and this will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry market to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, permanently change her living conditions, and secure the future of her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":64.25,"image":{"id":1848949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Molo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-05T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-05T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.91,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":707.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":728.41},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":749.7},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":771.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":794.16},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":817.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":841.26},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":865.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":891.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":917.19},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":944},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":971.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.85},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.22},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.82},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.14},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.8},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.03,"local_amount":1682.43,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:12:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1942.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378516},{"amount":18.47,"local_amount":1533.11,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1769.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.69,"payment_id":711506488},{"amount":23.84,"local_amount":1924.96,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2222.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.22,"payment_id":752111467}],"funded_date":"2015-04-05T20:45:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":863875,"name":"Robert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robert is a forty-year-old hardworking married man living in Kamwenge, Uganda.

He is a good father, independent, entrepreneurial, has good taste, and is friendly, responsible and hardworking.  He runs his business in the area south of the city, an area characterized by its road networks that connect it to the city and it also has one of the two international airports.

I observed the various events that there were, and with a little bit of help, I went out on my own,\u201d he comments.  The advantage of his business is that he has extensive experience, and the disadvantage is that he does not have the furnishings for events with large amounts of guests.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to be the best party decorator.  He wants to purchase tables and chairs to rent out for events with large numbers of people.  This is the first sequence of loans with this institution in the four years that he has independently grown his business.  For these reasons, Napoleon is requesting a loan to purchase tables and chairs to decorate events with many guests.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":701.67,"image":{"id":1848166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase tables and chairs to decorate events with large numbers of guests","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-04-05T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-05T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Napoleon Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-04T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-06T04:00:00Z","amount":436.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T04:00:00Z","amount":494.28},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T04:00:00Z","amount":497.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T04:00:00Z","amount":519.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T04:00:00Z","amount":549.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T04:00:00Z","amount":553.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T04:00:00Z","amount":607.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T04:00:00Z","amount":617.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T04:00:00Z","amount":640.36},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T04:00:00Z","amount":678.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T04:00:00Z","amount":702.13},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T04:00:00Z","amount":704.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.94},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.03},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.03},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.36},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.77},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.81},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":136.32,"local_amount":930.95,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":935.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046579},{"amount":72.83,"local_amount":497.38,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":499.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344400},{"amount":76.03,"local_amount":519.23,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":521.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554614},{"amount":80.49,"local_amount":549.67,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":552.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468712},{"amount":81.03,"local_amount":553.38,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":555.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296562},{"amount":254.97,"local_amount":1741.25,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1749.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076775}],"funded_date":"2015-05-01T22:05:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carlie Herron","image":1714606}},{"id":861694,"name":"Issa's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Issa, au premier rang \u00e0 droite sur la photo et portant  une chemise manche courte, est membre d'un groupe de 13 producteurs agricoles qui travaillent et vivent dans le village de Diran Tabacoro, au sud-est de Bamako, au Mali.

However, he has managed to overcome every challenge he faces. \r\n\r\nSamuel seeks a loan, via Juhudi Kilimo, to venture into horticulture farming.

John loves dairy farming. John practices mixed farming, and through that he has been able to take care of his large family, but not everything has been good for this humble and hardworking man. The Kitale area has a ready market for poultry products and eggs, and John being an enterprising person would want to take advantage of that and make profits. That is why he is kindly seeking a loan to start poultry farming. \r\n\r\nJohn has enough space on his farm and wants to make use of the space through poultry farming. Other than income from selling eggs and poultry products, John will also get manure to use in his farm, hence the money that could have been used in buying it will be saved.

But Williamson is a man who has never given up despite the weather or the circumstances that can occur. He is always willing to get the resources for his family. He is 37 years of age and a very aggressive, hardworking and ever smiling farmer from the Thika area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns that favor farming. \r\n\r\nBecause of the high unemployment rate, Williamson never secured any white collar job, but that never killed the inspiration he had of getting out of the poverty bracket, and he started farming five year ago.

January 2009. She lives with her husband and her son in Mai Son district, Son La province. Her family lives mainly based on cultivation and breeding, so the income after deducting all costs is just about 50 to 60 VND million per year. This income is just enough to cover the family\u2019s living expenses with a little amount left. She cannot do anything with that remaining amount. She wants to buy fertilizer for the corn tree and sugar cane but she does not have enough money. Therefore, she wants to borrow a loan to buy fertilizer for that purpose. She will try to find an extra job to work hard to get the money to repay the loan for M7-MFI on time. She hopes the loan amount will help her family invest effectively in growing corn trees and sugar cane, and that next year it will bring double the productivity as compared with the last year.

Therefore, she wants to borrow a loan to buy fertilizer for the next coffee crop.\r\n\r\nShe very much expects that the loan amount will help her family with good conditions to invest in their coffee field, and the coming crop will bring her family coffee trees laden with fruit. She will work hard to get money to repay the loan for M7-MFI on time.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2446.33,"image":{"id":1849456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

He made the decision to purchase a biodigester in order to take advantage of a free and widely available resource on his farm: his cows' manure. The natural methanization process taking place inside the biodigester will produce enough biogas to cook and heat water in the house, as well as nutrient-rich organic fertilizer to increase the yield of his corn field in a sustainable way. As Lorenzo will shift to an efficient and cost-effective way of producing his own energy and fertilizer, he will reduce the operational costs of his farm, protect the environment and improve his family's quality of life. Indeed, treating his animal's manure will lead to the elimination of flies and bad smells it used to attract and eliminate the production of greenhouse gases. With his savings, Lorenzo plans to expand his milk production by buying additional cows and investing in a milking machine.\r\n\r\nThis loan represents 20% of the total cost of the biodigester, the

Her doormats are of different colors and designs that make them look nice and attractive in homes. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 900 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan which she will use to buy additional raw materials like fabric and thread. This will in turn boost her business income as she expands her business. She is thanking God in advance for the financial help that will be given to her and for a good return on her investment, for it will be a great help in their daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nCherry trusts that by God's grace her business will continue to increase.  She prays for guidance, good health and long life.

This will in turn boost her business income as she expands her business.

Her family\u2019s main income is mostly based on her salary, so it is just enough to cover the family\u2019s living expenses and save a little amount. However, the saved amount is not enough to invest in raising chickens. Therefore, she wants to borrow a loan to invest in raising chickens. She hopes the loan amount will help her family have capital to invest effectively in breeding chickens, and in the future the breeding-chicken model will bring her family a considerable profit.

He is married to Emerita, a homemaker, who takes care of her grandchild who goes to elementary school. Virgilio works hard to provide for his family's daily needs and helps to send his grandchild to school.\r\n\r\nVirigilio owns and operates his own transport jeepney service. He has a single unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney. Jeepneys are the most common and cheapest form of public transport in the Philippines. Its origin is from the American military vehicle used during World War II.  The Filipinos used their imagination to make it longer and installed two long seats as a means to transport people, goods, and even sometimes little animals. Since then, the sight of colorful jeepneys are all over the country. \r\n\r\nTo help continue operations of his business, Virgilio is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan to pay for the registration, tire replacement and maintenance of his jeepney. It is very important that his unit is always in good running condition to ensure efficient service. He thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to him for it will be a great help to sustain his family's daily needs.\r\n\r\nVirgilio hopes to buy another jeepney unit. He wants his grandchild to go to college and someday become a professional. He prays for his and his passengers' safety on every trip. Every week, Virgilio faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members* to share stories of his work and to draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1849536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Rakhteeja's husband needs to purchase different types of fruits for reselling purposes so that he can increase the size of his business, improve his sales growth and earn the maximum profit. But due to an unfavorable financial position, her husband is not in a position to purchase fruits for his business purposes. Therefore Rakhteeja has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that she can help her husband to purchase the above items for his business purposes. \r\nShe is very thankful

He lives there with his wife and his two children. Mutakin works as security in a private company. He knew Ruma from one of the sales executive that came to his house. He decided to join Ruma because he wants to learn about how to start up a business. Right now, Mutakin sells mobile airtime credits for his community. \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Mutakin needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits to his community, so his community can easily connect with their loved ones, no matter how far they are apart. Mutakin\u2019s goal towards Ruma in the near future is to serve an e-commerce business for her community, Ruma\u2019s latest product called Mapan.  \r\n\r\nAs seen in the photo, Mutakin is the one who is sitting in his own stall.

She is a responsible mother of five children. \r\n\r\nSadaqat's husband owns a shop selling chicken in the market. He has been running his chicken shop for the last ten years. He buys chickens from the wholesaler and sells in his shop to the customers. His number of clients has increased due to his good attitude towards his clients. Moreover, he is the sole earner of his family. So, he wants to increase his income. In this way he would be able to meet his family's requirements. He is a very honest shop keeper, and behaves politely to people. He wants to buy broilers to sell from the chicken shop to improve his standard of living. For the development of his business, he needs a loan. So his wife, Sadaqat, contacted BRAC Pakistan who issued her a loan for her husband's chicken shop. \r\n\r\nSadaqat is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.

Korotoumou  is in her first year with myAgro; she signed up in order to help increase her harvest thanks to the services offered by myAgro. This year Korotomou is making [loan] payments in order to buy a myAgro package of OPV [Open Pollinated Variety] seeds and fertilizers for growing peanuts, with the view of increasing the yield on her land plot of 0.0625 ha [0.15 acre]. Kortomou has been growing peanuts for 30 years already. Thanks to an increased yield and thus an increased revenue, she plans to buy a seeder and cover the school fees for her children.

They work in different businesses like general commerce and providing services amongst others. They decided to get together and form a communal bank through which they hope to improve their businesses and their quality of living. <br \/><br \/>One of the members of the group is Aracely who is 38 years old and is in a common-law relationship. From this relationship she has 2 children, aged 14 and 8 years old. The oldest studies in secondary school and the youngest in primary school. <br \/><br \/>Aracely in order to earn something for herself and to help her husband with the household expenses and the expenses generated by her children's studies, works in commerce. She sells clothing of all types, underwear, shoes and jewellery by catalog. Her method of selling is door-to-door. She goes out most days and also sells from her house when her clients come needing some piece of clothing or product that she sells. She sells on credit and collects every 8 days. <br \/><br \/>She has been in this business for more than 5 years and she earns the income that provides for the education of her children.

He has a few birds that give him eggs for food, but he feels it is time to upgrade it to becoming a business. He is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 to purchase a brood of hens for egg production. He will be selling the eggs he collects to neighbors, institutions, hotels, and to retail shops. Income from this business will help him deal with the high transportation costs that are eating into his profits. He will also use the increased income to meet his family's basic

She is married to Rodel, a dried fish vendor and has three children. The eldest is in Elementary School and the younger two are not of school age yet. She manages their household and her husband is her business partner. Her earnings from her business are a great help in their daily needs.\r\n\r\nAurora buys dried fish at wholesale prices and sells them by the kilo. She buys several kilos of \"tuyo\" (sun dried fish with a pungent smell that tastes really good). It is usually consumed at breakfast and best eaten with spicy vinegar dip and fried rice. There are many patrons who prefer her products since they are assured of its freshness and cleanliness. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 700 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue and expand her business, she is requesting a PHP 15.000 loan, which she will use to pay for several packs of dried fish. Her steady earnings are a great help in meeting the family's everyday needs and for the schooling of her child. She is thanking God for a good return on her investment and the financial help that will be given to her.\r\n\r\nAurora aims to grow her business so she can send all her children to good schools and see them become professionals someday. She prays that her family will always lead a happy and quiet life. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1849595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Gilbert is a very honest, hardworking, and dedicated farmer who is 37 years of age and lives in Nandihills, Kenya, an area known to have the best weather patterns that favor crops and animal farming. \r\n\r\nGilbert has much experience in farming, which he has been doing for three years. He is considered one of the best farmers in his village. Gilbert\u2019s primary sources of income are selling milk and eggs and crop farming. He is a very dedicated dairy farmer, and has nicknamed his cow \u201cLelgina\u201d (black and white). Dairy farming is close to his heart, and every day he wakes up to milk his cow and that makes him very proud. \r\n\r\nHowever, the income Gilbert makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet his family's expenses, yet he has kept hope alive that this will improve. He is seeking a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a quality dairy cow. He plans not to buy just an ordinary cow but to buy a quality breed of cow that will produce between 10-20 litres of milk a day. \r\n\r\nThe additional milk will result in additional income and thus improved living conditions, the ability to repay the loan, and investment in his children's education. The cow manure will also provide benefit, being used to increase the fertility level of his farm, hence increasing productivity. Finally, the loan will allow Gilbert to build a bio-gas digester, which will be helpful in saving energy. \r\n\r\nThis loan will completely change his life and improve his living conditions.

second row. The other Farmers in the group are Amin, Boim, Tri, Seto, Arni, Lilik, Yudi, Sujito, and Nur. They are standing in front of a cow-house. Mat has a family with four children. All of them live in a small village in the Lampung Tengah region of Indonesia.\n\nMat has been running a small-scale vegetable farming for more than six years. His business runs well. He also have a small cow-fattening business. However, he was troubled with the high price of chemical fertilizers and he get protested by the neighbors because the cow dungs, which is not used as fertilizer, is causing a pungent odor.\n\nAfter socialized by Yayasan Rumah Energi and Lembaga Pengembangan Pertanian Nahdatul Ulama\/LPPNU (a local NGO \u2013 biogas construction partner of YRE) about Household Biogas (BIRU) program, Mat saw the biogas program is a solution of his problem. He saw opportunity to reduce his dependence on non- renewable cooking gas. In addition, he also wants to use bio-slurry (biogas residue) as organic fertilizer for his plants or sell it to increase revenue. Mat is keen to purchase a bio-digester, but he does not have sufficient capital for it. A loan from Kiva will help him and other group members to make it possible.\n\nHe hopes that if he can build bio-digester, he can use the bio-gas for cooking, and bio-slurry (biogas residue) as fertilizers for his plantation. He also want to sell the remaining bio-slurry to increase income.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":968.75,"image":{"id":1839339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

Despite difficulties in the area to maintain a business, these members have a rather solid and courageous determination. The members share a sense of solidarity. They all work primarily in small-scale commerce.\r\n\r\nFatoumata (who is seated on the right with her hand raised) is the featured borrower of the group.

The income generated from selling the milk will be used to fully repay the loan, and will also go towards the education of his children.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Fousseyni, who is 65 years old, lives in a family made up of 39 persons, of whom 17 are children. In a village where agriculture represents the dominant activity, this business permits him to ensure food self-sufficiency for his family. \r\n\r\nFousseyni is beginning his first year in the myAgro program and his motivation is the idea of getting better harvests and accessing a system of payment which allows him to pay progressively for his agricultural package. Fousseyni makes the payments in order to buy a package of OPV seeds and fertilizer for growing maize on his plot of one hectare. Through this purchase, Fousseyni hopes to guard his family from hunger thanks to better yields and a better income. He also dreams of building a house and buying a seeding machine to improve his technique for seeding next year.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Now she earns the main source of income for her family by raising livestock and planting crops. Her spouse provides tractor and combine services to the local population. Syrga currently has two cows, ten sheep and a 2.3 hectare plot of land where she grows potatoes to sell. Thanks to her hard work, Syrga earns around 15,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to expand her business, Syrga applied for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) with Bai-Tushum Bank to buy a calf and ten sheep to fatten and sell. Syrga is one of five members of the \"Nurkunai\" group. She plans to use the earnings from the loan to invest in the future expansion of her business and to build a house for her family.

her life.  She has always found the strength to move forward and keep growing. \r\n\r\nShe has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture and is the proud owner of a small parcel of land and has done mixed farming for  ten years. She sells eggs and milk and earns a decent income. She also engages in a personal business to make ends meet. Betty is passionate about dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She wakes up early every morning to milk her cows. Although this humble woman has been making profits selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand.

Therefore, Jameela has applied for a Kiva loan from BRAC Pakistan. She is confident that this investment will help her son to purchase necessary medicines for his business, thus enabling him to fulfill his business needs and allowing him to earn a more profitable income.

She is married with three children between the ages of three and nine years old. Two of them go to school. Agathe is a farmer, and she has been growing rice for the past 12 years. Her husband is also a farmer. With the loan from Kiva, she would like to buy fertilizers to grow rice. The profits from the business will be used to improve her welfare and pay for medical insurance.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.
