Previously she worked in a shop and a bakery, but she decided to change jobs. She currently works from Monday through Friday and travels to her home town only on weekends; because of the distance, she cannot commute every day, so she has to rent a room in the city. In addition to this permanent job, she has a small chicken farm; her mother and father help her by taking care of the chickens while she goes to work.\r\n\r\nShe used the previous loan to buy school supplies and a bed for her son; the loan was very helpful. She is currently requesting a new loan to improve the facilities of the farm she owns in her community; this will allow her to increase the number of chickens so that she can sell them at a good price.\r\n\r\nElvia dreams of being able to continue working hard to continue to make money for her household and to save to buy her own home; she also wants to help her son finish school and become a professional. Also, she would like to modernize her chicken farm so that she can be closer to her family and take care of her son, especially.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":286.08,"image":{"id":1849152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":" to improve the facilities of the farm she owns in her community.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-04-06T18:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-06T18:10:06Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvia Evangelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":36.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":35.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":37.98},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":40.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":42.03},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":43.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":44.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":46.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":47.9},{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":52.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.04},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.03},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.21},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.97},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.9},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.28,"local_amount":36.28,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":36.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650537683},{"amount":37.93,"local_amount":37.93,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":37.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666803584},{"amount":36.44,"local_amount":36.44,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":36.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683483628},{"amount":94.24,"local_amount":94.24,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":94.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696541158},{"amount":48.05,"local_amount":48.05,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:55:10Z","rounded_local_amount":48.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711454626},{"amount":33.14,"local_amount":33.14,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":33.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752063689}],"funded_date":"2015-04-08T01:06:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Philip Hess","image":1178611}},{"id":862335,"name":"Manegre 02 Sapone Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mr AMIDOU est responsable du groupe  MANEGRE 02 DE SAPONE.

","en":"This woman is Khadisa. She is a single mother and lives in the Pyandj district. She is 53 years old. She divorced her husband and raised her son alone. She has one son who is studying at university. Khadisa has been raising crops for over twenty years and this is her sole source of income. Every season she and her son plant crops. Working the land is difficult, but Khadisa does not pay attention to that and continues to do this kind of work. The most important person in her life is her son, whom she lives and works for. She currently needs to fertilize the land in order to produce a rich, high quality harvest. She does not have the money to buy enough fertilizer and this is why she applied for a loan.

In the picture, she is seated and is wearing a blue shirt and black pants.\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her children. One of them attends primary school, and the other is still not of school-age. They live in their own room made of brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof. Their home has drinkable water, electricity, and indoor plumbing. \r\n\r\nThe need for improvement brought her to lead a bank of people with businesses such as: selling eggs, selling food, making pastries, selling sheets, serving tea, selling fruit, and doing upholstery. She does this to request a loan and to improve her work. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling cosmetics by catalog by traveling to meet different people. She sells the following brands: Avon, Mary Kay, Jafra, and others. She does this activity by traveling around the area during the whole week in different fairs and markets in the city. The products with the highest demand are: earrings, lip pencil, anti-aging lotions, facial treatments, perfumes, mascara, etc. \r\n\r\nShe says that she started her business selling clothing and cosmetics but that she now only sells cosmetics. She says that she plans to grow her business. The advantage of her business is that the majority of her sales are made by order and by catalog, so she doesn\u2019t have to carry and hold all of her products. The disadvantage of her business is the lack of capital she has for investment to buy products wholesale. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to grow her business as a cosmetics distributor and to open a costume jewelry business. She wants to make an investment in her business by buying a stock of seasonal cosmetics wholesale to satisfy her clients\u2019 demand. This is her second sequence of loans with the institution in the 2 years that she has been doing this activity. \r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Florinda requests a loan to buy cosmetics wholesale to offer more variety and with the goal of opening a costume jewelry business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":1849198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cosmetics wholesale to offer more variety and with the goal of later opening a costume jewelry business.

She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue with her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 19,000 loan which she will use  the loan to buy a bigger oven and ingredients such as flour, ground pork, bacon, and native vegetables (such as eggplant, bell peppers, and mushrooms) needed to make her pizza. She is encouraged by the good sales of her pizza. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help and a good return on her investment for it will greatly help in sending her children to school and fund their daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nSusan dreams to have her own place and store to sell her pizza and attract more customers. She prays that both of her children will get a college degree to allow them better opportunities in life. She faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/ lients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1850424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

communities across the US. She had been a mortgage loan officer for seventeen years, and a mortgage company owner for nine years, but, as she puts it, \u201cafter spending 26 years in the corporate world, it was time to fulfill my dream and open my own store. There is nothing more rewarding than having your own business and helping others to achieve their dreams.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Rebecca was born and raised in Chicago, IL, but with the help of her son and a friend, moved to Michigan to open her store. In 2014, she opened Union Pier General Store\u2014a retail store selling organic, vegetarian, kosher, gluten-free, and vegan food, as well as local produce, recycled items, and items made specifically in Michigan. Her goal was to educate people on healthier eating and living, and make this sort of lifestyle accessible and affordable to a greater number of people, especially those with special diets. <br \/><br \/>Although her store has only been open for seven months, Rebecca is already receiving appreciation from customers in surrounding areas. The demand for her services is expanding, and she now must use a loan to develop her store\u2019s services. The purpose of this loan is to purchase new storage equipment and also equipment to expand the available products at the store. She hopes to sell smoothies, snow cones, baked goods, and apparel in the coming years, as well as hire two new employees.<br \/><br \/>In the future, Rebecca hopes to hold community events to educate people on healthful eating.

bread for 10 years now to provide her child with the necessary living needs after the divorce. Randa is specialized in preparing tasty jams, pickles, Kishek, and many other well-known Mouneh items that are highly requested by her customers. Her house is her base for work; she has to stay to take care of her child and at the same time, she has to improve and develop a business that can support them to benefit from a better living.\r\n\r\nHer business demands a lot of effort to search for the best products to work with, and the process itself needs a lot of effort to be done, but Randa is thankful that she's still capable of doing it by herself. Her income is good enough to cover their living needs, but not enough to expand her working sector. Thus, for this reason, she is acquiring a loan from Kiva's field partner Al Majmoua to buy the necessary raw materials to develop her business, especially with the current season's products to be conserved for the winter and autumn seasons.\r\n\r\nRanda is the second lady from the far left side of the picture.

She runs a business selling secondhand clothing.  She's a good mother: enterprising, patient, understanding, responsible, and very hard-working. She runs her business in the South region, along the banks of the River Pira\u00ed, an area that's experiencing some of the most rapid growth in South America. It's a warm, subtropical zone where the rainiest months are January and February. The hottest month is January and the coldest month is July.\r\n\r\nSusana is brown-skinned and has long, black hair that she wears tied back. She has brown eyes, a short stature, and slim complexion. Her first language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks among family, and she speaks Spanish with society at large and for her business. She shares her life with her children, who are in school. They live in their own home, made from brick and cement, which has water, electricity, and sewer services.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling secondhand children's clothing. She buys clothing that is either gently used or sometimes still new with the tag on, then sells it at accessible prices, between 50%-70% off the original price. Her work begins by choosing good clothing and making sure it's in perfect shape. Each selection must pass a demanding acceptance process, assuring that the garments are still like new. \"The secondhand clothing I choose - party dresses, coats and accessories. Each item is graded a piece at a time and is paid for either at the time or on credit,\" she says.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she sells high quality clothing and steady customers.

His primary sources of income have been milk, poultry, and some \u201cside hustles\u201d he does to supplement the meager income he earns from farming. \r\n\r\nDairy farming in Kenya has seen an upsurge in growth and milk prices in the recent past have skyrocketed. This has translated to increased earnings for farmers. Leonard, being a very hardworking and visionary farmer, wants to take advantage of the ready market. That is why he is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo, to buy a good-quality breed of dairy cow. Leonard has already decided which dairy breed he requires, and because of his immense knowledge on preparing hay, his cows will have plenty of food and will produce more milk. Leonard projects that the cow he acquires through this  loan will be producing more than 10 liters a day. Because there is a ready market for milk, he does not worry too much about competition, and marketing the milk will not be a challenge. He will be selling it directly to the market as well as to big dairy-processing firms, which will result in increased earnings. Additionally, Leonard has planned that instead of selling the milk in its raw form, he will be packaging the milk. This will also improve his income. Profits from selling milk will enable Leonard to be very successful. He also plans that with his accumulated profits, he will be able to construct a biogas digester soon to produce energy that he will use in cooking and other domestic chores."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":189.46,"image":{"id":1850519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Molo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-07T00:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-07T00:30:06Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.02,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3184.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3277.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3373.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3472.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3573.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3678.16},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3785.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3896.29},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4010.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4127.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4247.98},{"due_date":"2016-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4372.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.42},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.06},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.29},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.56},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.86},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.2},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.35,"local_amount":3188.89,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3265.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.08,"payment_id":681378529},{"amount":36.99,"local_amount":3359.53,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3440.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.34,"payment_id":696588194},{"amount":37.29,"local_amount":3488.63,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3572.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.47,"payment_id":711506501},{"amount":36.84,"local_amount":3376.03,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3457.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.67,"payment_id":731023329},{"amount":39.97,"local_amount":3638.41,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3725.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.46,"payment_id":752111483}],"funded_date":"2015-04-12T17:54:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":864873,"name":"Fouzia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fouzia is a 50-year-old mother of two children.

progress.  Mophat, however, is a man who never gives up despite the weather or situations that happen. He always manages to meet the requirements of his family. He gets up very early in the morning to go to his farm where he works. He owns a small piece of land together with his lovely wife. They have been blessed with five children. \r\n\r\nOn the land, they have kept dairy cattle and grown vegetables for 12 years. Their main income sources are milk and crops. They recently ventured into a small personal business to supplement the meager income they earn. From Kiva lenders, Mophat is seeking a loan of 40,000 KES to grow his horticulture business. (Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector.) \r\n\r\nIt is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to afford Mophat access to a loan facility that will help him to grow his horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With this loan, Mophat\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability.

Moataz applied for a loan of 500,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase the necessary goods and items that people need daily to expand his business. A long time ago, he started his business selling only water and some soft drinks in a very small shop to the people who transport overland from Saudi Arabia to Yemen and vice versa. Over time, his business improved and he opened a grocery store as you can see in the photo. A Kiva loan will help Moataz to face most of the demands of his customers and the profits from this loan will increase. He will be able to take his wife outside of the country for treatment because she has a dangerous disease.

One of her children is very young but they both attend school and Idalina is also financially responsible for her 2 stepdaughters, who also live in Maputo. She has been working as a poultry farmer for quite some time and this provides her with a wage which she uses for her household expenses. Idalina has been involved with Hluvuku since 2012 when her lack of funds meant that she was unable to satisfy her customers' requirements using her own money alone. Her involvement with Hluvuku has already enabled her to acquire her own plot of land on which to build her home and, these days, she is one of the best poultry farmers in her district.

He lives with his partner and has 1 son who is 8 and a daughter who is 10, and he works at a salaried job in a porcelain factory.\r\n\r\nHe is a good father, understanding, with a good attitude, patient, responsible and hard-working. His work is located in Sacaba, a rural area located 13 kilometers to the east of the city, known for its cuisine based in guinea pigs and is famous for its many chicha factories that make corn chicha (which is a ferment of corn), of a nice flavor. The village is known jokingly as \"Sacaba - where the chicha never runs out\". It has a temperate climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 19-25 degrees centigrade. \r\n\r\nJose has dark skin, dark eyes, wears glasses, has short, straight, black hair, is short, has a medium physique, and his native language is Quechua which he speaks in this place and he speaks Spanish due to the general culture and the work that he does. He shares his life with his partner who works selling vegetables and with his children who are students. They live in their own house made of brick and cement with a roof of metal sheeting that has electricity. To get water, they have to walk about 10 minutes to the river to collect water in buckets and put it in barrels for different uses. He works in a ceramics factory, in quality control for the products, work that he does on a consistent schedule from Monday to Friday. \"In 3 years since I built my house, we have not had potable water because the service is new in the zone...\" he says. The advantage of his work is that it leaves the weekends free to be with his family and the disadvantage is that the days are long. His dream is to have potable water in his house.

briquettes. The briquettes are made from tightly compacted straw, sawdust, wood branches, and corn stalks. He is young, ambitious and with ideas to do great things to protect the environment. Serghei is 35 years old, has higher education, married and has one child. Two years ago he came up with the idea to produce briquettes which are efficient, cheap and use recycled materials. So he rolled up his sleeves and began to work to make his dream a reality. This last fall he began to produce his first briquettes but this was met with some challenges along the way. Though these challenges have motivated him to work even harder to make his dream a reality. In order to be competitive in the market, Serghei needs a powerful machine that costs approximatively $4,000. With $1,200 being personal contribution from Serghei, which leaves $2,800 the amount being requested. Purchasing this machine will allow Serghei to produce briquettes more efficiently. He believe that his briquettes, which used recycled material, can help avoid the clearing of trees thus protecting a valuable element to the environment. This machine will also allow the business the possibility to expand, which result in the creation of new jobs for the local

The agricultural work is carried out at the family level, and when the work demands more manpower, they are hiring seasonal workers. The biggest problem faced by the family, is the lack of needed agricultural equipment and because of this they are unable to process the orchards in the correct time period. They have a T40 tractor and some agricultural equipment that is old and doesn\u2019t meet the requirements needed. Mrs. Iana\u2019s dream is to procure the correct agricultural equipment (plow, cultivator and rake). She will personally contribute $1,500 but requires a loan of $ 3,000 for her dream to come true. With the new equipment she will be able to perform timely care of the orchards which will allow her to bring in a rich harvest.

De clima templado con una temperatura que var\u00eda durante el d\u00eda entre 18-25 grados cent\u00edgrados.\nPonciano es de tez morena, cabello lacio negro corto, ojos pardos, baja estatura, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica delgada, su lengua materna es el Quechua que se habla en el lugar y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y por el negocio que realiza. Su vida la comparte con su esposa que se dedica a la agricultura y con sus hijos; los 2 mayores estudian en la escuela y el menor es un beb\u00e9, viven en una casa propia construida de adobe con techo de calamina que cuenta con energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y agua de pozo. Su negocio es la fabricaci\u00f3n de adobes. El adobe es un ladrillo, hecho de barro (arcilla y arena) mezclada con paja, moldeada en forma de ladrillo y secada al aire libre, con ellos se construyen paredes y muros. El procedimiento que sigue es; 1- prepara el barro con los pies; pisa el barro mientras lo va mojando, y tambi\u00e9n canta y baila, 2- agrega la paja picada, 3- llena los moldes  con su mezcla, y 4- deja secar 3 o m\u00e1s d\u00edas. \u201caqu\u00ed en la zona es muy dif\u00edcil transportar material de construcci\u00f3n, por eso los adobes tienen gran demanda; porque los fabricamos en el mismo lugar de construcci\u00f3n\u2026\u201d comenta.

Su sue\u00f1o es tener un negocio estable hasta en las \u00e9pocas de lluvia, \u00e9l desea realizar la compra de materiales de construcci\u00f3n como; madera, arcilla, paja y otros, necesarios para desarrollar su negocio. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 10 a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Ponciano solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de materiales de construcci\u00f3n para fabricar adobes y continuar con su negocio.\n","en":"Ponciano is 45 years old and married. He has two sons including a six-year-old and an infant of two months, and a 10-year-old daughter. He earns a living manufacturing mud bricks.\r\n\r\nHe's a good father, and an enterprising, generous, upbeat, responsible man who works hard.\r\n\r\nHis business is in Sacaba, located 14 kilometers away from the city. This is a place of residence for the farmers who cultivate the tropical land, and here are the properties from where the farmers arrive with their tropical harvests to sell in the city. The climate is mild with daylight temperatures ranging from 18 to 25 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nPonciano has a dark complexion, black hair that is short and straight, and brown eyes. He has short stature and a slim frame. His mother tongue is Quechua, spoken in the area, and he speaks Spanish in the community and for his work.\r\n\r\nHe shares his life with his wife who works in agriculture, and with his children: the two elder go to school and the youngest is a baby. They live in their own home made of adobe with a corrugated metal roof. They have electricity and well water.\r\n\r\nHis business is the manufacture of adobe. Adobe is a brick, it is mud (clay and sand) mixed with straw, shaped into brick form and dried in the open air. It is used to build interior and exterior walls.\r\n\r\nThis is the procedure he follows:\r\n1. He prepares the mud by stepping on it while adding water. He also sings and dances while he does this,\r\n2. He adds the straw,\r\n3. He fills the molds with this mixture,\r\n4. He leaves it to dry for three or more days.\r\n\r\n\"In this zone, it is very difficult to transport building material, thus there is a great demand for adobe bricks since we make them on site\" he comments. \r\n\r\nThe advantage in his business is that he makes the bricks at the construction site. The disadvantage is that adobe drying is very difficult during the rainy season. His dream is to keep a steady business going even through the rainy season.\r\n\r\nPonciano is requesting the loan to buy material such as wood, clay, straw, and more needed to make the adobe, so that he can continue developing  his business.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with the institution in the ten years that he's been doing this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.

She has five children, three of whom are dependent on her. Among these three children, two are studying in high school and one is too young to attend school. For supporting her family, she grows rice as their main source income. Sometimes, she works for others for a fee to supplement her family\u2019s income. \r\n\r\nThis is her second cycle with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) and she has fully repaid her past loan as well.

Feeding his poultry is his hobby. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Nandihills. Sosten has good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market. However, the demand is so high. Being a visionary man, he has always wanted to increase his poultry. He is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. <br \/><br \/>Accessing financial services for marginalized communities is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising men like Sosten will achieve their dreams and goals. Sosten believes that the key to increased egg production is proper feeding of poultry and taking good care of them. By ensuring that the poultry are fed well, he is guaranteed to reap the benefits. <br \/><br \/>In addition to selling eggs and poultry meat, he will also sell poultry feathers that are commonly used to make earrings.

She is 37 years old. Her husband works in the Russian Federation. She works as a secondary school teacher. Even though teachers do not have a high salary, Gulbahor loves her work. She likes to work with children and guide them in the right direction. Gulbahor also understands that because her children are growing, she needs to increase the income in the family in order to save money for the children's education.\r\n\r\nGulbahor decided to open a pet food store. In Tajikistan, where 60% of the population is involved in agriculture, including animal husbandry, this business will be quite profitable. Her sister will help her with this business. Gulbahor purchased several bags of grain and other food and already started her sales, but needs more merchandise. She requested a loan to buy an inventory of

She is a resident of the Tursun-zoda region. Adolat is married and has two children; one son and one daughter. Adolat and her husband work with field crop cultivation.
