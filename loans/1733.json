Jashon, who is 34 years old, is a mixed farmer from Kitale, a rural town in Kenya. He has been practicing mixed farming for the past eighteen years. This hardworking man earns his livelihood through selling milk, crops and a personal business he engages in when the harvests are low. <br \/><br \/>Jashon passionately loves poultry farming, and rearing chickens is his hobby. Every day he wakes up in the morning to collect eggs and feed his chickens, and he finds this very fulfilling. Neighbors have been flocking to his compound to buy eggs, and through word of mouth, news has spread like wildfire in the whole village that he has quality eggs. The demand is so high he cannot fully satisfy it. Jashon is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan, Jashon will be able to satisfy the demand, and this will translate to an increased income level. <br \/><br \/>Through Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders, Jashon believes that small-scale farmers like him will be able to benefit from financial solutions.

Her income from this business is low and she wants to increase it, but she doesn't have enough money to invest in the business. For this reason, she applied for a loan of 30,000 YER from Kiva partner AMB to purchase materials and the necessary ingredients to make traditional incense. Through this loan, her business will expand and she can attract more customers. She plans to use the profits from this loan to make a large amount of incense and export it to the Gulf countries, hoping to get hard currency. Iman and her family have a small apartment and their monthly rent is high.

He is so excited to receive a solar light which he says that now he will be able to have somewhere to charge his phone. Edward plans to use the profits he earns from this year\u2019s harvest to repair his home.\r\n\r\nEdward's Group will use the farming inputs received with this loan to cultivate a total of 5 acres of land. In addition, the group will also receive a total of 5 solar lights between them.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1803132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-08T02:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-08T02:30:04Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esinas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estera","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Getrude","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonita","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":79120,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79120}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-07T20:20:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":865239,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello world, meet Joseph, a farmer from a small village in the Nandihills area of Kenya, which is scarce of available land. He lives on the farmland with his wife of 20 years and six children. He started farming in order to provide food for his family and make additional income from the farm activities. Today, his primary income sources from the farm are milk, maize and a variety of food crops. Joseph has favoured animal keeping since they provide a regular source of income at a low maintenance cost. He is seeking a small business loan to purchase a beef cow. The cow will provide beef for sale. Income from the beef cow investment will help him settle other business-related expenses such as farm inputs for crop cultivation. Joseph stated, \"With the money, I will be able to buy another cow and boost my family's income.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing two water-filtration systems will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase two UV water-treatment systems with a 450 litre tank and a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nGood Samaritan School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

Her biggest problem affecting coffee production is vagaries of weather, especially the dry season that dries coffee plants, plus price fluctuation of coffee.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":597.94,"image":{"id":1850969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy organic fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2015-04-08T03:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-08T03:10:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":25.6,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2016-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-25T12:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":254967.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":651655289},{"amount":84.86,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-26T12:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":254967.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.56,"payment_id":668716439},{"amount":84.61,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:25:26Z","rounded_local_amount":254967.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.81,"payment_id":681546216},{"amount":79.23,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":254967.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.19,"payment_id":696786211},{"amount":76.85,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-24T12:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":254967.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.57,"payment_id":714046838},{"amount":78.02,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-23T12:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":254967.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.4,"payment_id":732673612},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-22T13:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":254967.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.07,"payment_id":754866429}],"funded_date":"2015-04-17T13:23:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":862701,"name":"Fatoumata's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Fatoumata qui se trouve sur la photo au deuxi\u00e8me rang \u00e0 gauche, et qui tiens la pochette n'gasene, est membre d\u2019un groupe de 16 agriculteurs inscrits \u00e0 myAgro, vivant et travaillant dans le village de Dalakana au sud-ouest de Bamako au Mali.

But, as a farmer, she must cope with difficulties, such as the lack of quality fertilizer and cattle.  \r\n\r\nFatoumata started her first year with myAgro and signed up because of the quality fertilizer and the payment system. This year, she is making payments to purchase a myAgro packet of OPV seeds and some fertilizer for growing peanuts, so as to increase her yields on her parcel of 0.0625 hectare. She has been growing peanuts for thirty years. \r\n\r\nWith an increase in yields and her income, Fatoumata is planning on purchasing cattle.

Her business is to knit alpaca shawls (mantas.)  She is a good mother, entrepreneurial, independent, optimistic, responsible, and hard working. She works in the \"Puerto Perez\" location, which is a small village located approximately 50 kilometers. from the city, on the edges of the sacred lake Titicaca. The population works primarily in agriculture, fishing, and livestock. From this location, people get around the different islands on the lake. Its climate is cold and dry, with a temperature which fluctuates between 0-12 degrees Celsius, and an approximate altitude of 4000 meters above sea level. Fabiana is dark complected, brown eyes, long, black braided hair, medium built, short stature. She dresses traditionally (hat, shawl, and skirt) and her native tongue is Aymara which is spoken in the area. She speaks Spanish as general knowledge and for her business. She spends her life with her husband who works in construction and with their children. The two oldest boys go to school, and the youngest is not of school age yet. They live in their own house built of brick and cement, with a corrugated metal roof, well water, and electricity. Her business is knitting alpaca shawls. She buys wool directly from the producers in greater quantities to spool ad knit it. The knits she makes are styled as large shawls or blankets. The manta is a type of blanket used by women traditionally, worn over their shoulders to protect themselves from the cold. The spool ad knitting process is done manually at home. \"I knit shawls since I was a little girl, it started when I used to help with the chores in the household, and knitting was part of our daily life...\"she stated. The advantage of her business is that she has consistent clients and she sells wholesale. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to purchase wool wholesale. Her dream is to have a specialized textile store. She wants to buy alpaca wool wholesale to fulfill her orders and open a store. This is the third sequence of loans with the institution in the 6 years she has worked in this field independently. This is why Fabiana is asking for a loan to buy alpaca wool wholesale, to fulfill her orders and open a textile

They all live and work in the village of Dalakana to the south-west of Bamako in Mali. 63-year-old Lassine is a father to 17 children aged between 16 and 42 years old, two of which are current receiving an education. The integration of family tradition into agricultural practices, his main source of revenue, and being able to provide food for his household led Lassine to work in this trade for the past 47 years. Lassine grows maize and millet on his plot of land, but as a farmer he must face many difficulties, such as a lack of rainfall and quality fertiliser. Lassine is beginning his first year with myAgro and he signed up due to the payment system. This year, Lassine took out a loan in order to purchase a packet of myAgro OPV seeds and fertiliser to grow maize in order to increase the yield of his one-hectare plot. Lassine has been growing maize for 40 years. With this increase in his crop yield and revenue, Lassine is planning to extend his plot of land to three hectares and to purchase a seed drill.

She is a widow who lives in a town near the city of Barranquilla, where she has operated a bakery for 35 years. She decided to dedicate herself to this work with the aim of obtaining income, because she never had the opportunity to study, and also with higher goals such as buying a house and helping her children get ahead in life. She had to learn this profession herself, which required nothing but desire and effort. Every day, Marina prepares products made with wheat flour, especially breads, which attract more and more new customers with their characteristic aroma at the end of the baking process: hence the saying \"it sells like hot bread.\" Marina has added the sale of soft drinks, natural juices and other beverages to her bakery, responding to the needs and tastes of her customers. For this reason, her business has a growing need for working capital, and the amount that she has is not sufficient to invest. This is precisely the reason why she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With it, she will buy wheat flour, yeast, sugar, fats and other supplies, to increase her production and offer a variety of bakery and beverage products. Her goal for the future is to have her own shop, and her dream of prosperity is to have a home of her own. This is the driving force behind the constant work she carries out every day.

She is a hardworking smallholder farmer based in Kambandi in the Chuka area of Kenya. The 36-year-old farmer is a single mother of two lovely looking children. \r\n\r\nSusan has been doing farming on her 0.2 acre plot of land for more than a decade. She keeps a dairy cow and six chickens for milk and eggs. For extra income, she brokers cereals. The 29 trees planted on the land show how Susan is environmentally responsible. \r\n\r\nSusan is seeking a loan to purchase grains. The only way she can expand this business is by getting her hands on more grains from the farmers. To do this, she has to leverage her business and pay the debt using the returns she will get from selling the cereals. \r\n\r\nSusan describes her childhood as difficult.

It reduces waste, benefits the local environment, and creates a brighter future for the disabled.  With this loan, Upasol will in part purchase a truck for collection and transportation of raw materials and recycling products. It will also purchase equipment for improving the recycling process and expanding warehousing capacity. \n\nUpasol (the acronym for \"Uni\u00f3n de Padres y Amigos Solidarios\" - Parents and Friends Solidarity) operates a free collection service for recyclable household goods in Vicu\u00f1a and surrounding areas. On an annual basis they collect 61 tons of recyclable materials. The collected glass, plastic, metal, and other reusable materials are then sold to local manufacturers for use in their production processes. The recycling revenues cover 75% of the costs of supporting the only rehabilitation facility for people with disabilities in Vicu\u00f1a. \n    \nIn addition to funding physical therapy, Upasol also generates jobs through its collection service and employs people with disabilities at the center. 4,000 people total benefited from Upasol\u2019s recycling services and rehabilitation center. Upasol brings visibility to both disability and environmental issues and serves as a community hub for resources and social activities. \n\nIn 1998 when Patricio Santander launched Upasol, there were no services or facilities in Vicu\u00f1a for children with disabilities. Parents had to take their children far outside of Chile\u2019s Elqui Valley for rehabilitation therapy. According to the National Disability Fund, less than 30 percent of the 2.5 million Chileans with disabilities are employed; in 2014, nearly 50 percent were living in poverty. In remote areas like Vicu\u00f1a, therapeutic facilities for the disabled are either underfunded or nonexistent. \n\nFor example, at age six, Paola suffered a cerebral aneurysm as the result of a congenital brain defect. At the time, she was not expected to survive; now, years later, Paola is thriving with support from Upasol\u2019s physical rehabilitation facility. \u201cIt is hard in the beginning,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut, with drive and motivation, you pull through.\u201d Called a miracle by many doctors, Paola now studies theology and wants to become a youth educator in Vicu\u00f1a. \u201cI also want to give back to Upasol,\u201d she says. \u201cI am very grateful to the center. It has given me so much.\u201d\n\nLimited opportunities exist for people with disabilities to live independently, receive a dignified job, or enjoy social activities. Upasol is trying to change that.

They think it is not glamorous, since in their minds a farmer is someone like their grandparents, doing backbreaking labor in the fields and getting little to show for it. \r\n<p>\r\nThus, they move from rural areas to urban ones, and most of them find themselves living in shanty towns. They are soon faced with problems that do not exist in the countryside: street crime, social inequality and discrimination. They also realize the cost of city life is significantly higher and the opportunities to produce their own food and other basic necessities is greatly reduced. \r\n<p>\r\nStella has chosen to be one among her generation to end hunger and alleviate malnutrition and poverty. She is particularly interested in poultry farming.

Hellen also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Hellen's Group will be able to receive a total of 5 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 4.25 acres.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1804514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy seeds, fertilizer & a solar light","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-09T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-09T01:10:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Loice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monwill","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Philice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Handa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everline","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maureen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":72600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-27T13:43:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":865623,"name":"Prisca's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Prisca, pictured above, is a group leader and is representing her group, formed by 12 farmers in Kakamega North District, Kenya.

She is a farmer and she has been growing rice for the past 14 years. Also, her husband is a farmer. With the loan from Kiva, she would like to buy fertilizers to grow rice. The profits from the business will be used to increase her welfare.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water-filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water-treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nBright Sparks School School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

Jason also decided to purchase a solar light as part of his loan, which he is very excited about, as it will allow him to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Jason's Group will be able to receive a total of 8 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 5.5 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1804543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-09T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-09T02:10:03Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jotham","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorcas K","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jascaa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfred A","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hillary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100910,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100910}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-08T04:47:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":865648,"name":"Selina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The person in photo is Selina; she is twenty-two years old, married, and blessed with three children.
