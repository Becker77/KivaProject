She works as a dressmaker.\r\nShe is a good mother, compassionate, solidary, enterprising, responsible, and very hard-working.  She works in the locality of Sacaba, a rural area characterized by productive growth and its commercial potential.  It is situated in a semi-tropical valley where the making of food is abundant and diverse.  Everything is accompanied with chicha (a fermented drink made from corn).  The climate is temperate all year with a temperature between 10 and 24 degrees Celsius.\r\nNatividad is dark-complected; of short stature; with brown eyes and long, black hair tied back in a ponytail; of medium build; and whose native tongue is Quechua which she speaks in her local and she speaks Spanish in the general public and in the work she does (she is seated in the center wearing a black vest and a chain around her neck).  She lives her life with her children who are studying in school.  They live in their own house constructed of adobe with a corrugated zinc roof and which has electricity and well water.  \r\nThe necessity to expand her business to generate better income and pay the expenses of her family causes her to form a bank of people with businesses such as food sales, clothing sales, cake sales, weaving, a bookstore, juice sales, and a pharmacy in order to request a loan and improve their activities.  Her business is the creation of stylish clothing such as skirts, pants, blouses, dresses, and all articles of fashion clothing.  She says,\" I started my business making fashionable clothing for girls which brought me customers and thus I continue with my work.\"  The advantage of her work is that the customers know her because of her fame as a dressmaker.  The disadvantage is the lack of capital to invest in the purchase of fashion materials such as cloths, threads, buttons, fasteners, etc.  Her dream is to have her own fashion clothing company.  She wishes to purchase a variety of cloths to create girls' clothing and other accessories.  This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in four years of continuous operation.

Kensecia also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have an overall improved quality of life.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Kensecia's Group will be able to receive a total of six solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 5.75 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1804583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-09T02:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-09T02:50:03Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kensecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Getray","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernetta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mildred","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eddah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phoebe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Savina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":84900,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-07T19:10:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":865678,"name":"Jean Damascene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jean Damascene is 39 years old.

","en":"Hasan is an honest and conscientious man who is 50 years old.  He's the father of two beautiful children and is a caring husband.  They live together as a family in a village, and are all on good terms with each other.  \r\n\r\nHasan has been raising livestock for a few years; he's loved animals ever since he was little, and is a very experienced livestock farmer.

Issa hopes that in the future he will be able to own more rental houses. \r\n\r\nIssa is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP), which primarily serves small entrepreneurs such as Issa who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":358.58,"image":{"id":1582506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more maize flour, rice and beans to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Pallisa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.166667 33.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2015-04-09T07:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-09T07:30:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.56,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Issa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":136112},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":141027},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":146121},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":151398},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":156866},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":162531},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":168401},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":174483},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":180784},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":187313},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":194078},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200886}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.94},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.89},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.22},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.54,"local_amount":277139,"processed_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-20T12:11:17Z","rounded_local_amount":279200.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666181422},{"amount":48.85,"local_amount":146121,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":147207.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.47,"payment_id":681308378},{"amount":47.4,"local_amount":151398,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":152524.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.7,"payment_id":696518074},{"amount":47.39,"local_amount":156866,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:31:30Z","rounded_local_amount":158032.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.55,"payment_id":711428296},{"amount":49.04,"local_amount":162531,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:30:45Z","rounded_local_amount":163739.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.81,"payment_id":730951044},{"amount":53.8,"local_amount":168401,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-21T13:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":169653.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.03,"payment_id":752041932}],"funded_date":"2015-05-08T08:01:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Lush","image":null}},{"id":865703,"name":"Alosius","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alosius is 34 years old and lives in the town of Pallisa in the Mbale region of Uganda.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nUnique School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Fr.

Muhammadali has been raising livestock for a few years.

shop to remedy the situation. The shop has been growing steadily: what started as a single set of shelves soon turned into a real shop complete with cold storage, display counter, and an increased variety of products. Elvia is very encouraged by her shop's progress and popularity in the neighbourhood. Thanks to it, she was able to support her household. Her children still live with her, but are adults who are seeking to make their own way in the world.\r\nElvia wants to stay on this prosperous track. She plans on turning her shop into a self-service supermarket, where customers would be able to find an even greater variety of products. She will spare no effort in achieving this goal, which is why she asks for a loan. She will buy vegetables, fruit, groceries, and a greater variety of household products.

He is a loving father and husband. He and his family live in the countryside. He has a few acres of land, where he grows feed for cattle and various other vegetables, then brings everything to the market for sale.

Despu\u00e9s aprend\u00ed descosiendo blusas y faldas, las trazaba y volv\u00eda a armar las piezas\u201d. Cuando la madre de Zenaida se dio cuenta de que descos\u00eda la ropa, prefiri\u00f3 llevarla con una amiga para que transformara esa curiosidad en una habilidad.

En el bautizo de uno de sus hijos, ella misma prepar\u00f3 el platillo y los comentarios de sus invitados la motivaron a vender tamales rellenos de barbacoa.

Each one of the three businesses she has are of great motivation to her. She has been sewing for 30 years, work she began because her husband\u2019s income as a field laborer was not enough to cover the household expenses. \u201cFrom a young age I liked making clothing or my dolls. Then I learned how to take apart blouses and skirts and resew them back together.\u201d  When Zenaida\u2019s mother realized that she was taking apart clothing, she took her to a friend so that Zenaida could learn how to transform her curiosity into a trained vocation. Her sales helped her buy an electric sewing machine to improve her work. Then came her business selling food. At the baptism of one of her children, she prepared all the food. Her guests commented on her food and that motivated her to sell tamales filled with BBQ. While she attended to people that arrived to her home, her husband would do deliveries to homes on his bicycle. When the doctors detected an incurable illness, Zenaida decided to try natural homeopathic products and had good results, so she decided to start selling them.  \u201cI am very grateful to God for allowing me to continue, my testimony is what has made my business profitable.\u201d<br \/><br \/>With the help of the loans Zenaida has purchased more sewing machines.

With the previous loans he managed to buy some goods for his house, gather construction supplies and also pay for his marriage ceremony.\r\nWith this loan he intends to purchase cement and iron, and to get a start on the construction of his house by paying for labor.\r\nHe would like to be able to build and finish his house and then buy a vehicle for his family later on.\r\nHis challenge is his income, because although it's not that low, it's still not enough for his many projects."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":719.81,"image":{"id":1852825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cement and iron, and to get a start on the construction of his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Moamba, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-18.25 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2015-04-09T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-09T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Efigenio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1045.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1291.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1189.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1277.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1401.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1293.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1538.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1540.57},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1524.07},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1715.55},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1714.85},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1827.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1865.27},{"due_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1959.24},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2003.53},{"due_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2140.76},{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2203.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.71},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.14},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.32},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.37},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.18},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.16},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.25},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.29},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.88},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.1},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.87},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.6},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":719.81,"local_amount":26174.76,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":26265.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666504939}],"funded_date":"2015-05-08T16:49:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":865910,"name":"Rom's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rom\u2019s group lives in a rural village in Prey Veng province in Cambodia.

She lives and works in the village of Tiele, southwest of Bamako, in Mali. Kadiatou, aged 52, is the mother of five children, from 13 to 26 years old, of whom one is currently in school. Her marriage to a farmer has led Kadiatou to do this work for thirty years now. She grows peanuts on her parcel of land but must cope, as a farmer, with difficulties such as the lack of rain and of quality fertilizer. \r\n\r\nKadiatou is starting her first year with myAgro and signed up with the aim of increasing her yield through the services offered by myAgro. This year, Kadiatou has made payments to purchase a myAgro packet of seeds and some fertilizer for farming peanuts, so as to increase her yields on her 0.25 hectare parcel. She has been growing peanuts for five years because of its value as a staple food, with the explanation that peanuts are directly consumed by families and are used in meals as a sauce base.\r\n\r\nKadiatou is planning on an increase in her yields and her revenues for purchasing farm supplies and equipment. Finally, she hopes also to be able to finance her children\u2019s marriages. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1842396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a myAgro packet of seeds and some fertilizer for growing peanuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"TIELE","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-04-10T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-10T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bougouri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mamadou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Adama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wassa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maridiouma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tenimba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assetou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bakar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modibo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Abi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":940000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":940000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1550,"local_amount":940000,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":943158.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401488}],"funded_date":"2015-04-11T12:19:11Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T15:28:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":862941,"name":"Zantigui's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Zantigui,  au dernier rang au centre sur la photo et portant une casquette bleue, est membre d'un groupe de 15 producteurs agricoles qui travaillent et vivent dans le village de Facobougou, au sud-est de Bamako, au Mali.

Thanks to her hard work and persistence, Gulfara now has her own 2.92 hectare plot of land, where she raises beans every year for resale. She also has a cow, a horse, and 20 sheep on her farm. The monthly income from Gulfara's agricultural work amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). With the goal of further developing her farm, Gulfara has approached Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of a heifer and 10 sheep to breed and sell.

is 63 years old, divorced, and she lives with her 15-year-old grandson.  She has a specialized secondary education. As a way to provide an income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and crop farming.  She started her activity 30 years ago when she bought her first livestock for 9,000 som (KGS).  Today, she is retired but still happily involved in farming.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has one cow and three sheep on her farm.  She also grows safflower and clover for resale on one hectare of leased land and two hectares of her own land.  She makes a monthly income of about 16,000 som (KGS), including her pension.  \r\n\r\nIn order to further grow her farming business, Kalina has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy one dairy cow and her calf in order to increase her livestock headcount and her production of organic milk.  Kalina is planning to use the earnings from her loan to repair her house and install plastic

He lives with his wife and 3-year-old son in the parish of Valle Hermoso, part of Santo Domingo de los Colorados, a very productive town which has tourism activity because of the hydrography in the area. \r\n\r\nJuan works selling empanadas and corviques [fried savory snacks made of ground plantain]. He began with his business when he was very young. His beginnings were selling empanadas outside his house on a plastic table. He says that it was hard at the beginning because he felt a bit embarrassed since he had never gone out to sell anything. Later, it improved and he began to go around knocking on doors. As the years passed, he could save up and he bought a cart which he outfitted with a kitchen to be able to make his rounds more comfortably. Currently, Juan has worked some years in this business, a business which has been able to get his family ahead. He says that it is not an easy job since he, along with his wife, gets up at three in the morning to grate and grind the plantain, a very tiring job. Later, at six, Juan already is in the streets selling everything. He even does it on the weekends when there are events and he is contracted to make a bulk delivery. \r\n\r\nJuan has never worked with loans in any institution. He says that he needs to purchase an industrial grater and a food processor to be able to grind the plantain, and in this way make his work a lot easier and save time. With the loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and the Kiva project, Juan will be able to purchase what he needs for his business. He is grateful for the help offered to the small business owners.

Due to the high rate of unemployment, he couldn't find a job to look after of his family.

That grocery store is the sole source of income for Ala and his family. Its capital is small, and Ala strives strongly to increase it. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, he applied for a youth loan of 200,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase different kinds of food materials for his grocery to expand his business. With this loan, Ala will be able to provide his business with goods that are not founded inside the grocery, and that will help him to attract a lot of customers.

belonging to the Below Poverty Line population. This group is located in a remotely rural village named Chanutmal of Nuapada district of Odisha, India. \r\n\r\nVegetable cultivation and vending is the primary source of livelihood of most of the members of this group. Pratima is one of them. The lady standing in the middle with a raised hand in the photo is Pratima. She is a very energetic lady of 32 years of age living with her husband, one son of 8 years and one daughter of 4 years. Her son is reading in 3rd standard.\r\n\r\nPratima has a vegetable cultivation farm of 1 hectare. Her husband manages the farm. Her husband is an active and cheerful farmer. He produces vegetables like brinjal, cauliflower, carrots, cabbage, chilies, cucumbers, papayas, ladies finger, onions, etc., in the farm and sells the products to the traders of nearby towns who come to take vegetables from the farm.  \r\n\r\nApart from that Pratima herself is running a general store in her house. Her husband helps her in bringing items like lentils, soap, shampoo, sugar, potatoes, onions, biscuits, etc., from the nearest town of 15 kilometers away. \r\n\r\nShe says that she earns a minimum amount of 5,000 INR per month from this business, which is insufficient to meet the day-to-day expenses of her family, farm expenses and business investment. \r\n\r\nPratima wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Kiva through her SHG from Mahashakti Foundation. She has planned to utilize the present loan to buy a water pump for her farm and purchase lentils for her general store. She expects a good return from this investment. \r\n\r\nPratima dreams to construct a house for her family and give better education to her children. She also hopes to give her whole family a bright future through her hard work. The other nine members of the SHG are doing ground nut cultivation and want to expand their businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1852152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase lentils for the general store and a water pump for the vegetable farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"CHANUTMAL, KHARIAR, NUAPADA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2015-04-10T12:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-10T12:50:03Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ambika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Durmila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kumari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laxmita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pratima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Premasila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rasmita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ubel Dei ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":132000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":132000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-22T12:11:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":866014,"name":"Rodrigo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"Sounds good\" isn\u2019t just a phrase that Rodrigo uses; it\u2019s become a way of life for him.

She lives there with her husband and two children (two daughters, 7 and 5 years old).\r\n \r\nTo help her husband with the family's daily needs, Lilit got involved in the farming business. Her husband is a migrant seasonal worker and all income from his work is hardly enough for covering the family's basic costs. \r\n\r\nAgribusiness helps them a lot.

Both the members are engaged in business activities of selling milk and cultivating vegetables to alleviate their poverty. Purba is the featured borrower of this group. She motivated Dutika to form this group so they could help and support each other in their business and personal lives. \r\n\r\nPurba will use her portion to purchase standard-quality seeds and fertilizers for her paddy cultivation. She hopes to build a house for her family, and she is very grateful to Kiva for this opportunity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1852174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase standard-quality seeds and fertilizers for her paddy (rice) cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Jeypore, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2015-04-10T14:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-10T14:10:05Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Purba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dutika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":36000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-28T16:28:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":860747,"name":"Vololona","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Vololona est une femme de 37 ans.

The profits from the business will be used to pay school fees of her children and to renovate her house.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.
