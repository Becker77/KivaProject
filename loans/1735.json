She and her family members are involved in agribusiness and they run a small but successful farm which includes cows, calves, sheep, and hens and the cultivation of wheat, potatoes and carrots. Berkruhi\u2019s house is too small for a family of five, but because of hard financial conditions, she and her husband haven\u2019t been able to expand it to improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Shirak region, where Berkruhi and her family live and work, is considered a poor region where the unemployment rate is very high and living standards are quite low. Lack of access to loan products, bad market conditions, and high costs combine to make it difficult for people to develop their area businesses. \r\n\r\nBerkruhi is requesting a loan to pay for livestock forage. Her request has been approved within a joint initiative between SEF International and Kiva to provide loans to the underserved population of the Shirak region to help them access markets and earn better livings.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1852034,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for livestock forage","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Arevshat village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2015-04-10T14:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-10T14:30:09Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Berkruhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":24.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":24.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":25.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":25.41},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":25.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":26.85},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":26.86},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":27.12},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":27.29},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":27.68},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":28.28},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":28.48},{"due_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":28.65},{"due_date":"2016-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":29.1},{"due_date":"2017-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":29.18},{"due_date":"2017-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":29.68},{"due_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":29.96},{"due_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":30.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.72},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.41},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.85},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.86},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.12},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.29},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.68},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.28},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.48},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.65},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.1},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.18},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.68},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.96},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.99,"local_amount":24.99,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-25T12:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":24.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696727005},{"amount":25.01,"local_amount":25.01,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-26T12:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":25.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711658479},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-19T12:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731162840},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:20:52Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752250634}],"funded_date":"2015-04-25T09:00:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":862804,"name":"Sincere (2) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Twelve years ago, Romio started up his own business as a barber in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She has a business selling empanadas and soft drinks.\r\n\r\nEvangelina is a good mother, and is enterprising, independent, patient, responsible and hard-working. Her business is located in the centre, which is an area which brings together universities, schools, public and private offices, etc. It has a tropical climate, with temperatures ranges from 21-35 degrees celsius during the daytime.\r\n\r\nEvangelina has olive skin, brown, shoulder-length hair, brown eyes, and is of medium height and build. Her mother tongue is guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family, and she also speaks Spanish, which she uses in her business. She shares her life with her youngest child, because her eldest is independent and has a family. They live in their own home, made of bricks and cement, with a corrugated iron roof and drinking water, electricity, and drains.\r\n\r\nEvangelina sells empanadas and traditional juices. An empanada is a thin pastry case which is filled with a savoury mix known as \u2018jigote\u2019, or a sweet or sweet and sour filling, which is then fried in oil. The \"jigote\" contains beef or chicken and vegetables. The traditional juices that she prepares and sells are: Mocochinchi (prepared with boiled dried peaches), Chicha (prepared with corn), and Som\u00f3 (similar to Chicha but containing boiled corn). \r\n\r\nEvangelina works from Tuesdays to Sundays during the day. Monday is her day off, which she uses to organise her activities. She says that \"empanadas are very popular mid-morning and mid-afternoon with a soft drink or a coffee\". The advantage of her business is customers' habit of eating them as a mid-morning and mid-afternoon snack.

away from the district headquarters of Balangir in Odisha, India. In January 2015, ten active women from this village formed a Self Help Group (SHG) named Tarini and came up to Mahashakti Foundation to access loans for expansion of their existing businesses. Mamata, the cheerful 23-year-old  lady standing with raised hand in the photo, is one of them. She lives with her husband and one baby son of two years of age. \r\n\r\nThe main business of Mamata is vegetable cultivation and vending. She has been doing this business for the last six years with the help of her husband. Her husband is a hard-working man who manages her farm. Traders from the nearest town come to her farm for vegetables. She grows all types of vegetables like tomatoes, brinjal (eggplant), cabbages, chillis, radishes, etc. Now she is earning a monthly income of 4000 INR. With this income somehow Mamata is managing to cover living expenses for her family. \r\n\r\nWhen Mahashakti Foundation started working in that area, Mamata, along with other nine members of the Self Help Group (SHG), approached Mahashakti Foundation and Mamata accessed a loan of 16,000 INR. From this loan she is planning on purchasing a water pump, seeds, fertilizer and pesticide for the farm. Mamata hopes to save enough for construction of a house and better education for her son.\r\n\r\nAmong the other nine members, four members are doing animal trading businesses, one member is running a general store, one member is running a cycle store, and the other three members are doing cultivation.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1852296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 600 a day. <br \/><br \/>To help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as canned goods, instant noodles, biscuits, soda and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are their source to meet their daily expenses and to send her children to school. She thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.<br \/><br \/>Christy hopes to maintain and grow her business so they could have a better life. She strives to hard to give her children the best education and prays for a quiet and happy life.

Karamat has a secondary education and, to provide the primary income for her family, is involved in animal husbandry, having started her business 15 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Karamat's hard work, today her farm contains 2 cows, 20 sheep, and 0.82 hectares of land, where she grows clover. Her monthly income amounts up to 20,000 som (KGS). To continue developing her business, Karamat requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the Bai-Tushum Bank to buy livestock in order to increase her livestock headcount and to buy fertilizers for cultivating the land. Karamat plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing her livestock headcount and repairing her house."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1850915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock in order to increase her livestock headcount and to buy fertilizers for cultivating the land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Alma village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-04-10T20:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-10T20:10:08Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karamat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":587.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":37534.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291468},{"amount":587.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:00:12Z","rounded_local_amount":37534.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730933873}],"funded_date":"2015-05-08T21:39:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":866150,"name":"Jackielou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jackielou is 32 years old and married with two children, one of whom is in school.

She lives with her partner, and has no children. Her business is to sell traditional food. She is entrepreneurial, independent, content, kind, joyful, responsible, and hard working. She handles her business in the southern zone of the city, a residential, very populated area with old and rustic homes, many without access to basic services. They have partnered to form a place of business and manufacturing in all areas. The foundation in this area is predominantly sandy, fine and limy, with a warm climate and a temperature which fluctuates between 21-35 degrees Celsius. Juana is dark complected, with ong, black hair tied back, dark eyes, short stature, thin built. Her native tongue is Guarani which she speaks at home, and she also speaks Spanish as general knowledge and for business. She shares her life with her partner who works as a driver. They live in a rented room, built of brick and cement, with a corrugated metal roof. They have drinking water, electricity and sewage. Her business is traditional food, such as:  Sopa de Remojado (bone soup,) cogote relleno (creole chicken neck with a stuffing which could be of potatoes and churiqui,) sopa de mani (peanut soup,) rice with cheese (rice, milk, cheese,) and others. She does this at her own home,  with tables and chairs arranged outdoors and covered with a couple of sunshades. She works from Monday to Saturday, leaving Sunday to organize herself and prepare for the following week. \"It was my grandmother who taught me how to cook, my relatives encouraged me to work by myself and now I own my own business..\" she stated. The advantage of her business is that the zone is very popular and she has many clients. The disadvantage is the competition and the lack of investment capital. She wants to expand her business by buying a stove, a can of propane gas and utensils such as silverware, pots, and skillets. This is the first loan with the institution in one year of doing business independently. Thus, Juana is asking for a loan to buy a stove, a can of propane gas, and kitchen utensils to cook for many clients."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":535.61,"image":{"id":1851128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a stove, a large can of propane gas, and kitchen utensils to cook for many clients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-04-11T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-11T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-11T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-10T04:00:00Z","amount":464.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T04:00:00Z","amount":474.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":503.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":525.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":540.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":564.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":583.49},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":624.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T04:00:00Z","amount":645.94},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T04:00:00Z","amount":667.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":701.76},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":704.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.74},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.76},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":137.43,"local_amount":938.51,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":948.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046600},{"amount":73.79,"local_amount":503.92,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":509.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344421},{"amount":77.59,"local_amount":529.89,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:39Z","rounded_local_amount":535.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554635},{"amount":78.55,"local_amount":536.46,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":541.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468727},{"amount":82.56,"local_amount":563.78,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":569.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296573},{"amount":85.69,"local_amount":585.21,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":591.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076782}],"funded_date":"2015-05-08T12:36:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Virginia Contreras Smith","image":1715363}},{"id":866189,"name":"Tuychibek","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tuychibek is a bright man.

Don Beto decidi\u00f3 comprar una casa en otra comunidad donde pudiera abrir nuevamente su tienda y tener todav\u00eda m\u00e1s clientes. \nDon Beto y su familia est\u00e1n muy agradecidos por todos los cr\u00e9ditos otorgados porque su negocio contin\u00faa mejorando, ahora puede comprar con facilidad sus productos, ha hecho algunos arreglos a su vivienda y puede comprar m\u00e1s bienes para su familia. \nLa dificulta de Don Beto es la competencia y las tiendas que contin\u00faan abriendo en la regi\u00f3n, pero esta situaci\u00f3n no lo desalienta sino que lo impulsa para tener la mejor tienda, con m\u00e1s variedad de mercanc\u00eda y sabe que los pr\u00e9stamos son el apoyo que necesita para lograrlo. \nDo\u00f1a Aurelia invertir\u00e1 su cr\u00e9dito en ropa; su hija Aurelia, en su zapater\u00eda y Do\u00f1a Elena, en su tienda de abarrotes.\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el centro del municipio donde viven los integrantes. Cerca tambi\u00e9n se encuentran el palacio de gobierno, un quiosco y una iglesia cat\u00f3lica. \n","en":"Familia H is a group made up of four people who are related.  They live in a Mazahua community known for having a spectacular view with hills full of leafy trees. \r\n\r\nModesty and charisma are the qualities that Don Gilberto, better known at Beto, is known for.  He is 59 years old and, though he worked as a professor, he is currently retired.  He is married to Aurelia and they still have one son who is dependent on them and who is still in school.  \r\n\r\nBeto is requesting a Kiva and Vision Fund loan to buy grocery products to stock the store he founded 17 years ago on the most-trafficked street and the only road that reached their community.  \"I started by just putting out some boards and boxes to display my groceries and with time I saw that I needed to buy shelves and news refrigerators so I could sell cold meats and soft drinks.\"  After a while they closed the road and built a wall, which hurt sales at the store.  Beto decided to buy a house in another community where he could reopen his store and have even more customers.  \r\n\r\nBeto and his family are very thankful for all the loans they have received because their business keeps improving; now he can buy his products easily; he has made some repairs to his home; and he can buy more things for his family. \r\n\r\nBeto's challenge is competition and the stores that keep opening in the area, but this situation does not discourage him, rather it motivates him to have the best store with the widest variety of merchandise and he knows that the loans are the support he needs to achieve this.  \r\n\r\nAurelia will invest her loan in clothing; her daughter Aurelia in her shoe store, and Elena in her grocery store.  \r\n\r\n*This picture was taken downtown in the city where the bank members live.  Nearby there is also the governor's mansion, a kiosk, and a Catholic church.

She explained to her that the earnings would help her support her family. She then started to sell in the capital of the country, where she also made the delicious dessert, with the help of one person who had all the necessary equipment. Afterwards, she walked the streets of Mexico City to sell the ice cream. \"Unfortunately, we had to go back to our village because the expenses began to mount up.\" Graciela bought some equipment from her cousin to continue selling. Now, thanks to the loan  she will be able to pay the rent of a commercial space in her community. \"It is hard to walk the streets and sell, that is why I prefer to have a stable location\" Graciela stated. During the summer months, her sales increase considerably and the difficult times begin when winter comes. But she continues to help her husband, especially to improve the quality of life of her children and to help them continue studying. The other members of the group are Daniel, who will invest in pigs; Maria Elena, Agustin, Mirna, Araceli, Amir and Patricio, in sheep; Rosalina and Clara in their grocery store, and Maria Graciela in clothing and shoes. *The picture was taken in the center of the community where all the members live. Nearby, there is the government palace, a small plaza, the catholic church and the kiosk which can be seen in the photo.

Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n e 20 a\u00f1os que se dedica a esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Maria solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de tela por mayor para cumplir con los pedidos de sus clientes y abrir una tienda.\n","en":"Maria a single, 58-year-old woman. She has a 23-year-old son and makes clothing for a living.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, patient, generous, optimistic, responsible, and hard-working. She has her business in the southern area of the city, which is the most industrialized region, mainly known for its farming and forestry. It is the most important area in hydrocarbon production. It is located at a height of 437 meters above sea level, with a tropical climate where the day temperature varies between 21 and 34 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is olive-skinned, with long, black hair tied back, dark eyes with glasses, short stature, and medium build. Her mother language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish in daily life and her business.\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her son, who goes to school and works. They live in their own house made of brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof. It has running water, electricity, and plumbing.\r\n\r\nShe works making women's clothing such as skirts, blouses, dresses, and other articles of clothing. She does this from her home and sells in large amounts to regular customers who order by the dozen. \"I make blouses, pants, and whatever kind of clothing the customer requests,\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she enjoys regular customers; the disadvantage is a lack of capital to invest in purchasing cloth.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to open a clothing store. She wants to buy cloth wholesale to fulfill the orders she has. This is her first sequence of loans with the institution in her 20 years in the business.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Maria is requesting a loan to purchase cloth wholesale to meet her customers' requests and open a store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1851632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy cloth wholesale to meet her customers' requests and open a store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-04-11T06:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-11T06:10:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-13T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":4200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-16T04:00:00Z","amount":326.71},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T04:00:00Z","amount":369.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T04:00:00Z","amount":375.15},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T04:00:00Z","amount":396.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T04:00:00Z","amount":401.28},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T04:00:00Z","amount":433.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T04:00:00Z","amount":448.36},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T04:00:00Z","amount":463.31},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T04:00:00Z","amount":488.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T04:00:00Z","amount":497.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.04},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.71},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.69},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.62,"local_amount":326.71,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:32:05Z","rounded_local_amount":333.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564629},{"amount":55.19,"local_amount":370.87,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":378.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046603},{"amount":55.68,"local_amount":374.16,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":381.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344424},{"amount":465.51,"local_amount":3128.26,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3188.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554637}],"funded_date":"2015-04-21T23:51:12Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Frank","image":null}},{"id":865754,"name":"Gladys Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gladys tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad es casada vive en Guaranda provincia de Bolivar tiene 2 hijos.

In addition, for Gladys it is important to create a legacy for her daughter, offering her the possibility of schooling and a better quality of life. \r\n\r\n\u201cThank you for offering us an opportunity for growth in each of our businesses, making our dreams come true\" are the words of the group.\r\n\r\n*The group meets in Arianna's house, who sells groceries; the photo was taken in the business.

'I had always wanted to have animals because my father already had experience in the sector, but we needed money to start up. I am very grateful to VisionFund'.\r\n\r\nWith the first loan, Eduviges bought 7 piglets.

She serves her customers from 7 am to 10 pm with a break devoted to household chores. Her husband Nicolas supports her with all he can besides helping her in the afternoons when she is selling. Her cooking passion as well as her experience after having worked at a restaurant, motivated Viki to start her own business without neglecting her family.  Since she started this business she has sold at a small commercial store where she has three tables, a grill with three burners and a refrigerator. This is also where she shows the cosmetic catalogs to her customers in order to take advantage of the wait time. Her previous loan was very helpful because she invested it in buying ingredients to prepare snacks, and with the earnings she purchased a new refrigerator, a blender, an iron, clothes and shoes for herself. \"God provides for everyone\", are Viki's words, who faces competition without problems. With the new loan she will buy milk, hibiscus flowers (jamaica), oatmeal, bananas, cream, cheese, dough, meat, chile, onion and plastic dishes, because this is what she needs the most to keep on selling her snacks. Viki's goal is to have a restaurant with a set menu where she can offer a larger variety of dishes. She would also like to own a place so she does not need to pay rent. \u201cLas Vecinas\u201d are grateful to Kiva and to VisionFund M\u00e9xico for the given loans that have favored the growth of each of their businesses in a way in which they are able to offer a better quality of life to their families with part of their earnings.  \r\n*On the picture, the members are standing in front of an old well.

Cuando Nara trabaja en el turno de la ma\u00f1ana en la gasolinera, dedica todas las horas de la tarde a las manualidades y viceversa. Sin embargo, en muchas ocasiones, tambi\u00e9n tiene que dedicar horas de la noche para entregar sus pendidos puntualmente y con calidad ya que estas caracter\u00edsticas son la base de su \u00e9xito.

Nara works in the gas station that is 20 minutes from her community, but in her free time she works embroidering, knitting and making figures from felt. \r\n\r\n\u201cI like my work since I serve many people, I have my own wages and a little extra money with the crafts\" are the words of Nara who is always laughing.  She began to make the crafts thanks to her mother \"For her and for my children, I have struggled each day.\" For 6 years now, Nara has worked at this small business. If a customer asks for some special design to embroider, she only needs to see the printed drawing and she creates it without a problem. \r\n\r\nWith the intention of expanding the variety of her creations, in two weeks Nara will begin a course on embossing and making figures with tires that will also help her to recycle and reduce the contamination of her community. \r\n\r\nTime is Nara's primary opponent since the customers tend to place their orders one week before using the small pieces. When Nara works in the morning shift at the gas station, she works all afternoon at the crafts and vice versa. However, many times, she also has to spend hours at night to finish the orders on time and with quality since these characteristics are the base of her success. With the new loan, she will purchase brushes, silicon, paint, thread and the material for the course in embossing which she is about to begin. \r\n\r\nThe group is grateful to VisionFund M\u00e9xico for the opportunity to offer them a loan to improve their work. \r\n\r\n*The photo was taken at Nara's house, who is wearing shorts and a red shirt.

This small income is hardly enough for family-of-five to meet even basic needs. \r\n\r\nDavit is eager to have his own business income, as he was unable to start any stable job. He requested a loan, but was rejected several times as having no business experience and stable revenue. His loan application was approved within the joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, the start up loan program envisages provisions to business start-up credits, with soft conditions, which don't have access to regular credit providers. \r\n\r\n Davit plans to open car washing service locally.  He will get the chance to generate significant income and thus cover all his family's needs. \r\nThe loan will be great help to this motivated man and his family, as their living conditions will significantly increase.

Oumou is 55 years old and the mother of 10 children between the ages of 11 and 33, with seven of them currently attending school.\r\n\r\nThe rooting of family tradition in agriculture, the household's primary source of income and food self-sufficiency, is what has driven Oumou to participate in this business for 30 years now. Oumou grows ground nuts and rice on her plot of land but, as a farmer, must cope with issues like a lack of quality fertilizer and farm equipment. Since she began farming, Oumou has grown ground nuts for their food-producing value, explaining that ground nuts are directly consumable for the family and are used as a base sauce in their diet.\r\n\r\nOumou is beginning her second year with myAgro; she re-registered because of the quality of the fertilizer offered by myAgro. She also highlights the positive impact myAgro's payment system has had on her daily life as a farmer in the past by allowing her to save at her own pace.

One of the most needed things is the acquisition of a refrigerator. Because of the long distance they are from the market they need to keep a lot of food. <br \/><br \/>He does not have enough money to make the purchase so he is requesting a loan that will be invested in buying a refrigerator so that his family has a place to keep their food.

She is married to Norberto, her business partner, and has six children, one of whom is in high school; the youngest is still in the elementary level, and the rest are already working. She works hard to meet their daily household needs and for the schooling of her children.  <br \/><br \/>Eugenia is into a food business. She has operated an eatery stall for five years already. In the Philippines, a food stall is a common sight, especially in populated areas. Working-class people usually buy their meals, sold at a reasonable price at food stalls, for convenience and to save money, rather than cook at home. The working class just eat their home-cooked meals at the end of the day with their families. <br \/><br \/>Eugenuia cooks well; that is why her food stall is popular in their area with neighbors and the local working community as her regular customers. She earns a minimum of PHP 900 net income a day.<br \/><br \/>To help her maintain her business, Eugenuia is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan to buy her raw ingredients, such as pork, fish, chicken, seasonings, beverages and mineral water as well, that are needed for her food business.
