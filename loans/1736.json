She is a married mother of three children and one of them is a dependent child that she needs to look after. She is originally from a rural area located in the Bovel district of Battambang province. The main source of her family\u2019s income has been generated from rice farming for 10 years. To be a better support for her family and earn more income, she also feeds chickens to sell as well. She could earn around 49,000 KHR per day for her family\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan for Seann\u2019s group, which consists of two members with Kiva's partner, VisionFund Cambodia.

She is 46 and a resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Ernesto, a tricycle driver, and has three children, one of whom is in high school; the other two are still at the elementary level. She manages her household while operating a number of businesses to augment their income, to support and meet their daily personal and household needs and to send her children to school. \r\n\r\nImelda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She is also a retailer of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) in her town and has a tricycle unit for transport service as well, which her husband drives for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 1,000 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her general store business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan, which she will use to buy grocery items such as canned goods, instant noodles, and biscuits, as well as LPG, to sell at her store. She is positive that this loan will boost her income as she expands her business. Her income is their source to meet their daily expenses and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her.\r\n\r\nImelda hopes to maintain and grow her business. She wants all of her children to get a college education to allow them better opportunities in life. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship group* to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1853163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and liquid petroleum gas to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-04-11T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-11T22:10:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3698.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536449},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2959.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017663},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2959.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314079},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.29,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1479.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522777}],"funded_date":"2015-04-12T11:54:43Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":866444,"name":"La Florida Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo  \u201cLa Florida\u201d est\u00e1  conformada por 06 mujeres emprendedoras, siendo la gran mayor\u00eda de ellas vecinas de la zona.

This is a group of 11 women and 2 men who decided to unite some time ago to form this credit group, which has been very helpful to them since they have been able to improve their small businesses with their loans. The members work in different activities such as general sales and services, among others. One of the members is se\u00f1ora Juliana, 24 years of age who is in a free union and has three children of 6, 4, and 2 years. Two them are in school or in kindergarten. Her spouse is a bricklayer.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Juliana is a woman who has always enjoyed getting ahead by her own means, and she helps her husband with household expenses. She works in the sale of Belcorp products (beauty and cosmetic products, perfume and accessories for ladies). She sells door to door and goes out nearly every day for three or four hours, especially during the morning, taking advantage of the time when her children are in school. She sells her products on credit and collects every week. She will use this loan to buy clothing to sell to obtain more income, which will help her to better her family\u2019s quality of life little by little. She appreciates these loans, since she will be able to improve her business and her economic situation.

She is the mother of six children.\r\n\r\nHer husband owns a clothing business. His practice is to buy clothing from a wholesaler and sell it to the retailers. He has a lot of customers who like to buy clothing from him. Sometimes he purchases clothing from out of the city at a low cost and sells it to the retailers. He has a good reputation in the market and his current customers refer his clothing to the other retailers, which becomes good advertising. One of her sons also helps her husband in the clothing business, and both give part of their time to the shop. \r\n\r\nMajidan has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so that her husband will be able to buy more clothing of various colors and designs to fulfill the demand.

In his farm Gevorg has cows, a calf, a heifer, a bull, horses, pigs and sheep. Gevorg sells beef, pork and mutton from his farm, which it is rather profitable, and also sells milk and cheese, which his wife manages.

widow with one son. Urunsa has a secondary education, she is a pensioner and, additionally, has worked for 20 years in crop cultivation and animal husbandry. Urunsa loves her work very much, and grows maize on her plot of land of 1.0 hectares. There are also two cows and ten sheep and goats on the farm. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS), but this isn't enough for a decent life.

It has a pleasant climate.  It is a very commercial city, and it is considered to be the place that joins the mountains and the coast.\r\n\r\nArlet has a small business.  She has been selling clothes and other products ever since she left school.  She is well-known in the area.  She started by going from house to house.  She was able to get a display case and take advantage of a place in her house now.  Arlet\u2019s business has been established, but she still continues going out and visiting her clientele.\r\n\r\nShe says that this is the first loan she was able to get.

Meet Vivian, an ever-smiling young farmer who is responsible and has had to overcome many difficulties through her life. However, she has always found the strength to move forward and to keep growing in her life. \r\n\r\nVivian has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture. She is the proud owner of a small parcel of land, on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years. Her primary sources of income are selling eggs and milk, and through this venture she has earned a decent income. She also engages in personal business in order to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nVivian passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cows. Although this humble mum has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. \r\n\r\nVivian is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. With the loan capital, she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 litres of milk a day. This will help to fully satisfy the demand. Through Juhudi Kilimo,  a Kiva field partner, she attended training sessions and was taught the best financial management skills. This will help her save more money in order to repay the loan fully and to improve her living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":72.27,"image":{"id":1853410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-12T14:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-12T14:30:07Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.5,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vivian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.48,"local_amount":3340.03,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3485.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.1,"payment_id":696588213},{"amount":34.29,"local_amount":3083.29,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3217.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.4,"payment_id":731023342}],"funded_date":"2015-04-12T17:17:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":864658,"name":"Adjo","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Etant une femme mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re d\u2019un seul enfant, Adjo est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 37 ans et vit \u00e0 Adidogom\u00e9.

Sarah also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Sarah's Group will be able to receive a total of 4 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 6 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1805125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-12T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-12T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdilta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raphael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hamphrey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Godwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Musa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":81280,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81280}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-23T01:34:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":866774,"name":"Paata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paata is a farmer in a village in Gori region.

Sacred Heart Girls School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nSacred Heart Girls School will repay this loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Patricia ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will increase the number of students coming to the school, and improve her students' concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children who fall sick from water-borne diseases."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":670,"image":{"id":1853457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

The school does not currently have access to consistently clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nWestern School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Kikonyogo ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students' concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children who fall sick from water-borne diseases, as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":670,"image":{"id":1853459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water to its students.

Her vision is for the business to be a leading enterprise in its category in the Nkubu area, offering farm inputs and animal feeds at affordable prices. \r\n\r\nShe is anticipating many customers, as there is little competition in the area. She has already invested some of her own savings to get the business started. She plans to use your loan investment to purchase more items to stock the agro-vet. Through the income she projects from the agro-vet, she will be able to pay school fees and meet other needs of her family without much straining. Eunice is a great client to Juhudi Kilimo; she has a perfect credit risk score. All that Eunice is waiting for is your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":174.95,"image":{"id":1853472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

married, and the mother of four school-age children who happily help her on the farm. Venera has a vocational education and earns the main income for her family by raising livestock and planting crops, having started a business in 2004. She currently has two cows and 18 sheep and goats and also grows barley and alfalfa. Her farm earns around 6,000 som (KGS) per month. Venera applied for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) with Bai Tushum Bank to buy hay and barley as feed for the livestock. This will help her to maintain and increase her herd. She plans to use the earnings from the loan to invest in additional livestock and save money to send her children to university.

This is Molline.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Calvary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Molline ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":440,"image":{"id":1853502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mbarara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.416667 30.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-04-12T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-12T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.07,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Calvary School","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3235000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":647000},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":647000},{"due_date":"2016-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":647000},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":647000},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":647000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":218.64,"local_amount":647000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":658900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.36,"payment_id":681370893},{"amount":216.29,"local_amount":647000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:11:53Z","rounded_local_amount":658900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.71,"payment_id":755507144}],"funded_date":"2015-04-13T03:12:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}},{"id":866836,"name":"Eva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eva is a 23 year old married woman living in Bundibugyo, Uganda.

Maria takes out the loans so that her husband can use them in his professions.  He currently has a shuttle bus that he uses to transport people every day from Portoviejo to Crucita.  This mode of transport requires many repairs and maintenance in order to provide a better service.  Little by little and with the help of the loans, they have improved their lives and obtained new means in order to move forward in life.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to purchase tires and spare parts that she needs to repair the shuttle bus.  She has been in this credit group for over 10 years and she likes it because of the benefits that she receives from the institution.  Her dream is to continue improving her life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1853807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to purchase tires and spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2015-04-12T19:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-12T19:50:04Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Narciza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":957.23,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":119.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":119.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":119.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":119.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":119.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":119.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":119.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":119.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":121.87,"local_amount":119.65,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":121.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649570243},{"amount":243.74,"local_amount":239.3,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":243.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665050779},{"amount":365.61,"local_amount":358.95,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:52:48Z","rounded_local_amount":365.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681348568},{"amount":243.78,"local_amount":239.33,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:54:23Z","rounded_local_amount":243.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696558887}],"funded_date":"2015-04-13T05:18:06Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:54:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carlie Herron","image":1714606}},{"id":866837,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emily is a smallholder farmer based in Kitale, Kenya, which is a town near the famous Rift Valley.

This is Amon. He is the Principal of Ruharo Vocational School, a mixed school in the Peri urban area of Mbarara with 520 students. Ruharo Vocational School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 liter tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nRuharo Vocational School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Amon ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":670,"image":{"id":1853505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

options for people with mortgages, final expenses, and annuities. Before starting her business, she had worked in the information technology (IT) sector for almost 20 years. She started selling insurance to earn extra money, but as she became more and more successful, she saw the potential to earn a solid income and decided to start a career in the insurance sector.  She continues to work in IT, but hopes to grow her business enough to transition completely away from IT and into insurance sales in the near future.\r\n\r\nAs a single mother, she works hard to bring in enough income to support herself and her daughter. With regards to her business, her greatest success has been successfully helping people protect their most valuable assets. However, she has encountered the difficulty of purchasing leads up front and juggling caring for her child and her career.\r\n\r\nThis loan will go towards purchasing insurance leads, a cell phone, business transportation, and marketing\/advertising efforts. She plans to hire several other agents in the near future, and in particular, hopes to provide employment options for single mothers, allowing them to make a solid income and spend more time with their children.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1850092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to pay for insurance leads, a cell phone, and marketing initiatives for her life insurance company","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Georgia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2015-04-12T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-12T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":5500,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carol ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5495,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":5500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":194.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":199.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":199.93},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":204.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":205.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":208.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":212.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":213.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":218.53},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":219.81},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":222.79},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":228.62},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":228.92},{"due_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":233.23},{"due_date":"2016-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":235.2},{"due_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":239.39},{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":241.64},{"due_date":"2016-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":244.92},{"due_date":"2016-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":248.93},{"due_date":"2016-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":251.63},{"due_date":"2016-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":255.5},{"due_date":"2017-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":258.52},{"due_date":"2017-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":262.03},{"due_date":"2017-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":266.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":214.12},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.73},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.01},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.83},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.13},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.44},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.41},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.61},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.86},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.14},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":249.16},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":251.86},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.73},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.76},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.27},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":866935,"name":"Marilou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilou is a married woman with three children.

I started collecting found wood from the jungle and sculpting it into unique pieces of art. When I go wood-hunting to the river and jungle, I become one with nature. It is such a peaceful ambiance and I thank God for the blessing and talent he has bestowed on me. Another reason why I love my work is that it does not harm our eco system.

That way she can supply them to supermarkets and other communities and also create jobs for other young people.\r\nHer biggest challenge is keeping control of her chicken farm, since it's a high risk business. She needs to do that to avoid facing production loss and therefore have problems repaying the loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":832.83,"image":{"id":1855880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase chicks and feed for raising chickens and then re-selling them at the local market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2015-04-12T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-12T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":24.99,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esmeralda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3215.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3203.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3383.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3382.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3454.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3557.26},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3548.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3752.94},{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":3758.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3818.23},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3970.21},{"due_date":"2016-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4003.29},{"due_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4076.68},{"due_date":"2016-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4192.49},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4269.82},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4412.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.76},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.43},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.43},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.31},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.06},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.77},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.91},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.59},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.84},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.76},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.81},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.04},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.2},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":162.15,"local_amount":5808.22,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5836.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649584570},{"amount":161.22,"local_amount":5775.12,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5803.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681363250},{"amount":167.64,"local_amount":6005.14,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6034.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696573455},{"amount":316.83,"local_amount":12244.23,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":12304.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":24.99,"payment_id":731008458}],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T13:05:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":866995,"name":"Alin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alin is a married woman with six children.

Carlos says that he will support his children as much as he can. He and his family grow basic grains and little by little, with a lot of effort, he has bought a solar power system. In this community, there is no electricity. Some of the accessories are in poor condition. He says that before he obtained this solar system he had to use a flashlight and a candle for light. When he obtained the solar panel everything was different. That is why he is asking for a loan to buy this equipment that are in poor condition, and have light again in his house.
