He is a member of a group of 12 farmers who collaborate with myAgro and who live and work in Sakoro, in the south-west of Bamako in Mali. Seriba is 40 years old and has eight children between the ages of four and 21 of whom four attend school at present. Farming is firmly established in family tradition. It is the principal source of income and the means to alimentary autonomy for the family. These are the reasons why Seriba has been working in this profession for the last 25 years. Seriba grows corn, millet, sorghum, and rice on his plot of land, but as a farmer, he is confronted with difficulties such as the lack of agricultural equipment and the rarity of rainfall. This is Seriba's first year of collaboration with myAgro. He registered with them due to the positive image of myAgro that he perceived in neighbouring villages and because of their payment system.

Diatou grows peanuts and rice on her plot of land, but must cope with difficulties such as the lack of farming materials. \r\n\r\nDiatou is starting on her second year with myAgro and reregistered because of the possibility to increase her yield through the services offered by myAgro. \r\nAdditionally, Diatou emphasizes the positive impact that the payment system, the quality of fertilizer and the myAgro seeds have had in the past in her daily farming. \r\n\r\nThis year, Diatou is making payments to buy a myAgro package of fertilizer for growing peanuts in order to increase her yields on her plot of .125 hectares. Diatou has been growing peanuts for 40 years for their consumption value, explaining that peanuts are directly edible.

5 children.  Burul has a secondary education, and has been actively working in animal husbandry and farming for 20 years.  She now has 2 cows and 0.56 hectares of her own land, as well as 0.54 hectares of rented land, on which she raises watermelons, corn, and peppers.  She is very hard-working, responsible, and goal-oriented.  Her monthly income is about 10,000 KGS, which is not enough to support the needs of her family.  For this reason, with the goal of further expanding her business, she turned to the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan of 50,000 KGS to purchase cows to increase the size of her herd.  With the income from the loan, Burul plans to continue to invest in the development of her

He lives with his pensioner grandparents and works hard to create financial stability for the family. Giorgi works as a hired daily worker and generates approximately 300 GEL. As there is high unemployment rate in the region and he was unable to start any stable job, Giorgi decided to be involved in his own business. <br \/><br \/>According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. Giorgi requested a loan from Credo to start up a new type of business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to poor people, who do not have access to credit products being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Giorgi plans to open a small general store near his house. He will purchase necessary equipment, have money for working capital and will start trading among his villagers. This new business initiative, financed with a Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family.

His loan requests were rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is seasonal income from their agricultural business. They have a vineyard and a plot of land where they grow nut trees. Also, they take care of cattle and produce dairy products. They sell nuts and cheese at the local open market. The average monthly income of the family is 250 GEL. It is hardly enough for food for a six-member family. \r\n\r\nAccording to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. Zviadi requested a loan from Credo to start a new type of business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income and who, therefore, do not have access to credit products. With the received credit, Zviadi plans to purchase a hand tractor and to start working on private orders. He will generate significant income and will do his best to provide financial stability for his family. Zviadi awaits your support.

Meet Mary. She is a smallholder Kenyan farmer making a living off dairy, poultry and maize farming. She started farming 20 years ago when she tied the knot with her better half. She did it to help her husband put food on the table for their family. \r\n\r\nMary had a difficult childhood, growing up in a poor family. She has become hardened to the realities of life, but she is deeply worried about her children's future. She struggles every day to afford education expenses to ensure that her children lead a more comfortable and fulfilling life. \r\n\r\nWith this request, she is seeking a KES 30,000 loan to purchase poultry.

She has good farming practices and puts  a lot of effort to take care of her family. She learned this from her parents.\r\n\r\nShe has been able to take care of her family and provide basic needs for her parents. Lizah lives near londiani in the Kericho area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming. Maize is a very common crop in Kenya and is a staple food for many who regularly eat \u201cugali,\u201c or hard porridge cooked from maize. One can usually buy sifted maize flour in the market, but its cost is higher because of the processing. Flour can be less expensive, however, if it is milled directly using a posho mill. The Londiani area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a great number of people. The main problem here is that the posho mill keeps breaking down so farmers cannot grind their maize. \r\n\r\nLizah intends to change this by buying another posho mill to serve the area. She will buy an electric, rather than diesel, posho mill, as they are more reliable. Hopefully, breakdowns will be few and far between. To accomplish this, Lizah is applying for a 100,000 KES through Juhudi Kilimo to buy a mill. \r\n\r\nProfits derived from the mill will be used to  repay the loan. In the next two years, Lizah sees herself  running more than one posho mill.  Lizah, with her enterprising spirit and her vigor and tenacity, wants to continue struggling to complete her dream of owning her own posho mill. \r\n\r\nShe patiently waits for your

In the morning, Elsa is does housework and prepares lunch for her child. At noon, she begins her work as a saleswoman: preparing the corn, esquites, napkins, mayonnaise, lemon, chile, sticks for the corn, cups, spoons, salt, the table, and steam cooker, which is everything needed for the sale of corn, esquites, and pork rinds.\r\n\r\nSince she was a child, Elsa helped the lady of the house where she lived, who sold all kinds of snacks. She remembers how at first she often burned her self trying to skewer sticks into the ears of corn, or from the steam from the esquites. With time Elsa gained experience and gained more skill, have everything ready and quickly serving her customers. Years later, Elsa inherited the business from the lady, who saw her as her own daughter and as the only person who could take over her business.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, and for her children, Elsa does her best every day in her business. People enjoy her snacks from 5pm, which is when the little stand is ready, to about 9pm, when Elsa finishes selling all her food for the day and is ready to go home. Moreover, Elsa also sells ice, flavored ice cubes, frozen oranges, and slushies, taking advantage of the hot season that helps her have good sales.\r\n\r\nEach of the loans that Elsa has received has helped improve her profits, which she uses to pay for her costs and for the school fees for her little one. This time she will invest her loan in mayonnaise, napkins, cups, cheese, sticks for corn, spoons, and corn on the cob, and a small portion in buying women\u2019s lingerie, as she wants to start this new business and continue to grow her income.\r\n\r\nThe group is grateful to each of the people who made it possible to receive another loan.\r\n\r\n* The photograph was taken at Beatriz's home, which is where meetings are held.

comunidad que se caracteriza por sus amplios campos de ma\u00edz, cultivo principal de la regi\u00f3n. \nCarmen es una mujer muy amable, mientras platicaba su vida sonre\u00eda en todo momento. Desde hace 15 a\u00f1os mantiene una relaci\u00f3n estrecha con VisionFund, \u201cCuando me ofrecieron el pr\u00e9stamo para m\u00ed fue una gran oportunidad, ahora estoy muy agradecida por todo el apoyo\u201d. En aqu\u00e9l tiempo sus tres ni\u00f1os eran muy peque\u00f1os y no quer\u00eda salir a trabajar para no descuidarlos pero tambi\u00e9n sab\u00eda que ten\u00eda que apoyar a su esposo ya que entre los dos ser\u00eda m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil cubrir los gastos de la familia. \nEntonces Carmen utiliz\u00f3 su cr\u00e9dito para comprar un buey, lo cuid\u00f3 durante algunos meses y al venderlo obtuvo buenas ganancias lo que la anim\u00f3 a continuar con la actividad. Por el momento no tiene ning\u00fan animal y necesita invertir un becerro. Para alimentar a sus animales, aprovecha la pastura del campo y en tiempo de sequ\u00edas tambi\u00e9n compra zacate, pastura y ma\u00edz.\nA corto plazo, Carmen planea mejorar el lugar donde conserva a los bueyes, por el momento s\u00f3lo est\u00e1 techado pero quiere construir las paredes del corral. Tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda comprar una camioneta para transportar a los animales y sabe que para lograrlo necesita comenzar a ahorrar.\n\nLas dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Gabriela quien invertir\u00e1 en tienda de abarrotes; Placida, Natalia, Gregoria y Araceli, en borregos; Maribel, en pollos y Lizbeth, en zapatos.\n\n*En la imagen aparecen las integrantes del grupo, do\u00f1a Carmen es quien viste un su\u00e9ter rojo*\n","en":"El Charquito is a group made up of women of Mazahua ethnic origin who live in a community characterized by its extensive corn fields, the main crop of the region.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a very friendly woman.  While talking about her life, she always smiled.  For 15 years, she has maintained a close relationship with VisionFund.  \u201cWhen they offered me the loan, it was a great opportunity for me.  I am now very grateful for all of the support.\u201d  At that time, her three children were very little and she did not want to go out to work because they would be neglected, but she also knew that she had to support her spouse, since between the two, it would be easier to cover the family\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\nCarmen then used her loan to purchase a bull, cared for it for a few months and obtained a good profit when she sold it, which encouraged her to continue with this profession.  For the time being, she does not have any animals and needs to invest in a young bull.  To feed her animals, she makes use of the pastures and in times of drought, she also purchases fodder, grass and corn.\r\n\r\nIn the short term, Carmen plans to improve the place where she keeps the bulls.  Currently, the roof is constructed but she wants to build the walls of the corral.

Much later, her mother got sick and no one in the family invested in the small shop until Guadalupe decided to take it up.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that she has requested for a loan, but for the experience of her husband who has invested in his own activities, she decided that a loan would be a great help to buy vegetables, canned goods and soft drinks as those are the commodities that most customers buy. Moreover, Guadalupe has an extra activity that helps her to maintain a cleaner community: she works to collect plastic bottles and every month she sells them to a customer who takes them straight to her home. In this period, Guadalupe collected around 10 bags full of bottles for which she received a return of about $1,000 pesos.\r\n\r\nThe goal of Guadalupe is to return to raising pigs and sheep as they did years ago, for which she needs to work hard and start saving.

Now, he is returning as a member of a credit group along with its other members, since this is how they will be able to invest the greatest amount of capital in their project.\r\n\r\nEsteban started raising trout almost by coincidence.  One day, some people he knew invited him to eat trout in another community and he became interested in the preparation of the fish.  \u201cIt is a first-rate food,\u201d says Esteban, and it is clear that his excitement is contagious for those who listen as he tells his story.  He left that trout farmer and restaurant owner with no just a good taste in his mouth, but with 17 kilos (37 pounds) of fish and an agreement to become a distributor, an profession that he practiced for three years.\r\n\r\nLater, Esteban thought that it was time to continue advancing and he built two pools at his house to start raising trout himself.  Esteban did not have any knowledge, but he could rely on all the support of his suppliers.  Now, Esteban has over ten years of experience and nine pools at his house, but the most important thing is that he has an even bigger project: his goal is to have a restaurant, to have people who help him to prepare the fish, and to cause in others the same effect that he experienced years when he tried the trout.\r\n\r\nThough he has relied on the support of other government institutions over the years, in order to carry through with his project he needs to invest in construction materials to build reservoirs that will help him to collect the rainwater and to address his challenge of lacking this vital liquid.

Cada mata de 5 cm la compran en 1 peso y las hojas y c\u00e1scara las utilizan como abono para el resto de la finca. El proceso de preparaci\u00f3n del caf\u00e9 es meticuloso ya que si el tueste se llega a pasar hasta unos instantes, el grano se echa a perder por completo. Do\u00f1a Magdalena y su esposo se dan a la tarea de moler el grano, antes en licuadoras, y de empaquetarlo en bolsas de \u00bc,1\/2, y 1 kg para distribuir con mayor facilidad en distintas comunidades. \n\nCon el pr\u00e9stamo anterior do\u00f1a Magdalena compr\u00f3 bolsas, etiquetas, una b\u00e1scula nueva, una licuadora y una selladora de bolsas y con sus ganancias compr\u00f3 un molino el\u00e9ctrico peque\u00f1o donde tarda menos en moler el caf\u00e9 y adem\u00e1s le permite regular el tama\u00f1o del grano. Esta vez utilizar\u00e1 su pr\u00e9stamo para comprar m\u00e1s bolsas y otro molino ya que la producci\u00f3n y venta contin\u00faan aumentando. \n\nEl pr\u00f3ximo objetivo de Magdalena es comprar una desalmendradora y una secadora para seguir optimizando sus procesos en la finca. \n\nLas cafeteras agradecen la oportunidad de formar parte de VisionFund M\u00e9xico y por el apoyo que reciben para hacer sus sue\u00f1os posibles. \n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el parque del municipio al que pertenece la comunidad, do\u00f1a Magdalena es quien viste blusa floreada y falda color azul.\n","en":"\u201cLas Cafeteras\u201d [coffee growing women] is the name of a group of women united for a common goal: the wellbeing of their families. The community where the group is located has a humid climate conducive to growing coffee, oranges, and sugar cane, the latter being the main crop of the region.\r\n\r\nThe name of the group is due to the fact that the five members have coffee production in common, although the majority also run a second business:\r\n\r\nRosa \u2013 clothing sales\r\nMagdalena \u2013 coffee sales\r\nMar\u00eda \u2013 grocery sales\r\nPatricia \u2013 sale of prepared food\r\nAmada \u2013 catalog shoe sales\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Magdalena is a very hardworking and empathetic woman. She is married to Jos\u00e9 Luis, with whom she has four children. Only one of them is still economically dependent on them.\r\n\r\nMagdalena's husband comes from a coffee producing family that has a coffee processing facility where the beans are subjected to a series of processes in order to obtain the final organic, preservative-free product that the family sells. \r\n\r\nSix years ago, Magdalena and her husband began working independently and now have their own coffee brand. They buy each 5 cm shrub by weight; the leaves and hulls are used as fertilizer for the rest of the farm. The process of preparing the coffee is meticulous, because if a bean is roasted a moment too long, it is lost completely. Do\u00f1a Magdalena and her husband take on the work of grinding the beans (previously in blenders) and packaging them in bags of 1\/4, 1\/2, and 1 kilo to easily distribute them in different communities.\r\n\r\nWith the previous loan, Do\u00f1a Magdalena bought bags, tags, a new scale, a blender, and a bag sealer. With her profits, she bought a small electric grinder with which she spends less time grinding the coffee; in addition, it allows her to regulate the size of the grind. This time she will use her loan to buy more bags and another grinder, as her production and sales continue to increase.\r\n\r\nMagdalena's next objective is to buy a coffee hulling machine and a coffee drier to continue optimizing the processes on the farm.\r\n\r\nLas Cafeteras are grateful for the opportunity to be part of VisionFund M\u00e9xico and for the support that they are receiving to make their dreams possible. \r\n\r\n* The photograph was taken in the community's municipal park.

Meet Eunice, a 52-year-old mum who is so humble, honest and a very hardworking woman on this planet Earth. Eunice is the mother of seven lovely children that she really adores so much and will always do anything good so that they never go to bed with hungry stomachs. Eunice hails from the Bungoma area of Kenya. She never got the opportunity to advance her education and get a white collar job but this did not kill her dream of wanting to succeed in life. <br \/><br \/>Eunice started farming and has been doing farming for the past six years. Throughout those years, she has gathered so much experience and all the farming techniques are at her fingertips. Eunice practices mixed farming on her farm and through the profits, she has managed to take care of her family's needs and give her children a good education because she believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success\u201d. Eunice is a mum who is very enterprising. She is seeking a loan of KES 60,000 to start horticulture farming on her farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, Eunice wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits. <br \/><br \/>Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring mums like Eunice to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. Eunice hopes that through the loan, she will improve her living conditions. Her dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year, she will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets by exporting fruits and vegetables.

The first child is 18 years old and the daughter is 9 years old. They live in their own home in the Chaltura sector which belongs to the city of Antonio Ante. People in this area work in agriculture and also sell traditional foods like cuy con papas (guinea pig with potatos). This is why Chaltura is known as the city of the guinea pigs.\r\n\r\nTania works selling products from Avon, Yanbal and also does other jobs like selling shoes. One year ago, for personal and family reasons she returned to Ecuador from Spain and since then she has had a store inside her home selling products. It is going very well for her. She alone is moving her children forward with the business. She has enough to cover everything that comes up during the month.

This year she decided to represent her group because she wanted to gain leadership skills.\r\n\r\nMary\u2019s Group will receive farming inputs to plant a total of 5.75 acres of land.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1807192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost efficient maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"kakamega south","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-14T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-14T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ezinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jonathan Mukabwa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sivenzia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mebo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ziporah Ayuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":70170,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70170}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-08T17:05:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":867242,"name":"Jehovah Shamah Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These members are part of the group called Jehovah Shamah and are into fresh and smoked fish.

She has a college degree and she has been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture since 2002.  These two activities constitute her family's main source of income.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has four horses on her farm.  She also grows potatoes and beans on 1.65 hectares of leased land and 0.35 hectares of her own land.  In addition, she has an orchard with apple trees. Gulnaz makes about 8,000 som (KGS) from her business every month.  In order to further develop her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 125,000 som (KGS) to increase her livestock headcount through the purchase of sheep.

Meet Catherine, 39 years of age, and a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Chwele, a remote village in Bungoma. She is happily married and is blessed with seven adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last 20 years and has gained a great deal of experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaged in pig farming. The Bungoma area is very populated, and the demand for pork meat is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds pig farming very enjoyable. Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand for pork meat, which is really high. \r\n\r\nShe lacks funds to increase her pig farming, and she is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy pigs. Being a woman seeking to access funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved and that she will be able to buy more pigs. As a result of the loan, she will sell more pork and pork products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her pig farming business to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, permanently change her living conditions, and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":106.6,"image":{"id":1854519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He now has 3 cows and 5 sheep in his herd. Kosimhon's wife milks the cows and takes the milk to the market to sell. She also prepares dried, curdled milk and sells it at the bazaar. In addition to all this, Kosimhon also grows crops.

encuentran preparando la tierra para iniciar a sembrar ma\u00edz en el mes de abril, aunque \u00faltimamente no ha dejado de llover y los campesinos esperan que el clima mejore para que las semillas puedan germinar sin complicaciones debido la humedad. En este lugar se unieron cuatro personas de campo para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y se identifican con el nombre de \u201cSan Antonio de la Ci\u00e9naga\u201d. \nFernando es uno de los integrantes, es un joven soltero que se dedica a la cr\u00eda y venta de bueyes. Inici\u00f3 la actividad por sugerencia de uno de sus vecinos quien se dedicaba a cuidar el mismo tipo de animales. As\u00ed, Fernando decidi\u00f3 darle una oportunidad a la actividad y afortunadamente sus ganancias fueron mejor de lo que esperaba. Ahora, Fernando no s\u00f3lo se dedica a trabajar el campo como la mayor\u00eda de los habitantes sino que tambi\u00e9n puede tener un poco de dinero extra para sus pap\u00e1s. \nFernando est\u00e1 muy agradecido con Kiva y VisionFund pues al iniciar su actividad, s\u00f3lo pod\u00eda comprar 2 bueyes  y un poco de alimento. Con la ayuda de los pr\u00e9stamos puede tener hasta cinco animales que puede comprar con mayor facilidad. Su pr\u00e9stamo lo invertir\u00e1 precisamente en la compra de m\u00e1s bueyes. \nEl mayor sue\u00f1o de Fernando es ahorrar una buena cantidad de dinero para poder construir su propia casa para el momento en que tenga su propia familia. \nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Mar\u00eda Isabel, Mar\u00eda Lorena y Soledad quienes tambi\u00e9n invertir\u00e1n en bueyes y vacas.\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el jard\u00edn del municipio donde viven los integrantes. \n","en":"In a Mazahua community in Mexico, the residents are preparing the land to begin planting corn in April, although lately it hasn't stopped raining and the farmers hope that the weather improves so that the seeds can germinate without complications from humidity.  In this area, four people came together to request a loan and they are known by the name \"San Antonio de la Ci\u00e9naga.\"\r\n\r\nFernando is one of the members.  He is a young single man who makes a living by raising and selling oxen.  He began in the business at the urging of one of his neighbors who was involved i raising the same animal.  In this way, Fernando decided to give it a chance, and fortunately his earnings were better thane expected.  Now he isn't only dedicated to working the fields like the majority of the inhabitants, but he can also give a little extra money to his parents.  \r\n\r\nFernando is very grateful to Kiva an VisionFund, as when he began his business he could only buy 2 oxen and a little bit of feed.  With the help of the loans\r\nhe can have up to five animals and can buy them with greater ease.  He will invest his loan in buying more oxen.  \r\n \r\nFernando's dream is to save a great amount of money to be able to build his own house for the moment when he has his own family.   The other members of the group are Mar\u00eda Isabel, Mar\u00eda Lorena and Soledad who are also investing in oxen and cattle.  \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in the garden of the municipality

They formed a family of seven children, who are now all independent.

She traveled through the streets and offered her products from house to house.\"  So, Don Fortino joined in this work, although he sold mainly pork rinds, sweets, and beverages.  He was helped by a small cart that he tied to two donkeys to transport the merchandise. With the passage of time, the income was sufficient to cover the family's necessities. \"With a little savings we could purchase an old van because we needed it to transport the merchandise,\" commented Fortino.  Fifteen years ago, the couple opened a small grocery store where they also sold fruits, vegetables, and pork rinds.  Fortino has shown a lot of gratitude to Kiva and VisionFund because during these three years, they have offered him loans to invest in his business and now he will have the opportunity to purchase more grocery products like bread, eggs, milk, oil, canned goods, etc.  Don Fortino's new goal is to save part of his earnings to purchase a new van for his family.

Part of the family\u2019s income goes towards funding the childrens\u2019 education.  \r\n\r\nTin and his family hope to eventually be able to save enough money to rebuild their home for future generations.\r\n\r\nThe CBO leaders oversee a group of 34 borrower in their village.  The fund will help the group purchase farming essentials before harvest time.  Kyar Kone Village\u2019s main focus is crop farming, as well as other  seasonal foods. They also raise livestock such as ducks and pigs for additional income.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":7525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1852145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones","Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to rent farm equipment, purchase petrol for farm equipment, and hire farm staff.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MM","country":"Myanmar (Burma)","town":"Dedaye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22 98","type":"point"}},"partner_id":416,"posted_date":"2015-04-14T14:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-14T14:30:08Z","loan_amount":7525,"lender_count":280,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kyar Kone Village ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MMK","disbursal_amount":7700000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":7525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-22T00:55:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Etchison","image":null}},{"id":867450,"name":"Pok's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pok is a 31-year-old  local farmer living in Siem Reap province.
