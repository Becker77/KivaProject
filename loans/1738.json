In this area, paddy farming can only be done in the winter season. Like many farmers in this area, savings are low before harvest season. The loan will help him purchase petrol and fertilizer, rent farming equipment, and pay transportation costs. The loan is important because he and his family depend on the income generated during the harvest season for the entire year. Thein is 63 years old, married, and supports a family of four (two children), the youngest of whom is in 10th grade. Part of the family\u2019s income goes towards funding the children's education. Thein and his family hope eventually to save enough money to buy pumping water equipment, which is much needed for his paddy fields.\r\n\r\nThe CBO leaders oversee a group of 21 borrowers in their village.

Tiene 47 a\u00f1os de edad y est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Jorge, juntos formaron una familia con cuatro hijos de los cuales ya s\u00f3lo uno depende de ellos y contin\u00faa estudiando su educaci\u00f3n secundaria.\n\u201cMi esposo trabajaba en Estados Unidos y estaba a punto de regresar, pero me preocupaba porque ya no tendr\u00edamos un ingreso estable para mantener a los ni\u00f1os\u201d entonces, todos sus hijos eran peque\u00f1os. Cierto d\u00eda, una sobrina le recomend\u00f3 vender flores y dado que no hab\u00eda recibido ning\u00fan tipo de capacitaci\u00f3n ella tem\u00eda que su negocio no funcionara; aun as\u00ed se atrevi\u00f3 a invertir todos sus ahorros. Recuerda que comenz\u00f3 la actividad un d\u00eda antes del mi\u00e9rcoles de ceniza lo que le ayud\u00f3 a vender todas las flores en las que hab\u00eda invertido. Despu\u00e9s, Angelina se dio cuenta que ten\u00eda un reto importante: la mayor\u00eda de las personas del municipio cortaba flores directamente del campo, pero su esfuerzo le ayud\u00f3 a mejorar sus ventas y las ganancias fueron aumentando poco a poco. \nTiempo despu\u00e9s escuch\u00f3 hablar de VisionFund y se anim\u00f3 a solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo para hacer crecer su negocio. Angelina ha aprovechado al m\u00e1ximo sus cr\u00e9ditos, actualmente tiene dos florer\u00edas, una que atiende ella misma y otra su esposo. Las ganancias tambi\u00e9n le permitieron comprar una camioneta para transportar las flores y ha contratado a una muchacha para ayudarle. Con su nuevo pr\u00e9stamo podr\u00e1 comprar m\u00e1s flores de diferentes tipos para seguir creando adornos florares, arreglos para regalos, coronas, etc.\nAngelina trabaja todos los d\u00edas muy contenta y verdaderamente disfruta de su actividad \u201cMe encanta llegar a mi negocio y estar entre tantas flores\u201d. \nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Norma quien invertir\u00e1 en inmobiliario; Erika y Josefina, en zapatos y ropa; Kevin, en pollos e Ilse, en manteler\u00eda.\n","en":"The \"La Palma\" group is made up of five women and one young man.  They are all good friends and have always supported each other in difficult circumstances.  The people where they live are very peaceful and the inhabitants are known for their friendliness. \r\n\r\nAngelina is a hardworking woman who is always concerned with her family's well-being.  She is 47 years old and married to Jorge.  Together they have a family of four children, of whom only one still depends on them while they attend school. When her children were young, \"my husband worked in the United States and was about to return, but I was worried because we did not have a stable income to care for the children\".  One day, her niece suggested that she sell flowers.  Since she had no training, she was worried that the business wouldn't work, but she dared to invest all of their savings.  She remembers that she started her business the day before Ash Wednesday since it would help her to sell all of the flowers that she had invested in.  Afterwards, she realized that most people in her town cut flowers directly from the fields, but her efforts helped her to improve her sales and her profits increased little by little.\r\n\r\nLater, she heard about VisionFund and decided to request a loan to grow her business.  Angelina has taken advantage of her loans and currently has two flower shops.  She works at one and her husband works at the other.  Her profits have allowed to her to purchase a truck to transport flowers and to hire a young woman to help her.  She will use this new loan to purchase more flowers of different types so she can continue creating decorations, flower arrangements, crowns, and other items.\r\n\r\nAngelina works every day and genuinely enjoys her work.  \"I love coming to my store and being among so many flowers\".  \r\n\r\nThe other group members are Norma, who will invest in real estate, Erika and Josefina, who will buy shoes and clothing, Kevin, who will buy chickens, and Ilse, who will buy table linens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":1849374,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase different types of flowers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-04-14T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-14T16:50:05Z","loan_amount":2575,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ilse ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":321.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":321.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":321.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":321.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":321.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":321.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":321.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":321.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1129.48,"local_amount":16668.08,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:20:05Z","rounded_local_amount":16740.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649764070},{"amount":795.33,"local_amount":11736.94,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":11788.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597594},{"amount":650.19,"local_amount":9594.98,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":9636.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682140985}],"funded_date":"2015-04-15T13:57:01Z","paid_date":"2015-07-19T12:20:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":867505,"name":"Betty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Betty, a widow living in Kampala, makes and sells cold juice beverages to earn her living.

Actualmente ella est\u00e1 muy contenta y orgullosa de sus gran familia, su mayor alegr\u00eda son sus 20 nietos y sus 6 bisnietos.  \nA sus 61 a\u00f1os, Filiberta a\u00fan se dedica a la venta de productos de limpieza y bordados. Cuando sus ni\u00f1os eran peque\u00f1os y se qued\u00f3 sola, sab\u00eda que ten\u00eda que trabajar para tener suficiente dinero y comenz\u00f3 a vender pescado en las calles de su comunidad. Durante cinco a\u00f1os esta fue su actividad pero hab\u00eda veces en que no lograba vender todo el producto que terminaba ech\u00e1ndose a perder, lo que significaba p\u00e9rdidas importantes. \nEntonces, Filiberta comenz\u00f3 a vender productos de limpieza y para el hogar como trapos de cocina, cucharas, volteadores, pinzas, entre otros. Ya son 23 a\u00f1os de experiencia los que tiene en este tipo de negocio. Para ella, VisionFund ha significado una gran ayuda para invertir m\u00e1s, tener m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda y pagar con mayor facilidad. \u201cRealmente ha sido de gran ayuda porque as\u00ed pude sacar adelante a mis hijos, pod\u00eda solventar mis gastos entre otras cosas\u201d comento Do\u00f1a Filiberta. Ahora ya no tiene tanta energ\u00eda para estar recorriendo todas las plazas y tianguis como antes y por eso comenz\u00f3 a bordar servilletas y manteles para tener un poco de dinero extra. \nEl nuevo pr\u00e9stamo lo invertir\u00e1 en productos de limpieza y en tela, hilos y estambres. Su gran ilusi\u00f3n, es mantener ambas actividades que le permitir\u00e1n seguir teniendo un ingreso para pagar sus gastos. \nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Don Mois\u00e9s quien invertir\u00e1 en productos de jarcer\u00eda; Gregoria y Aurora, en su tienda de abarrotes; \u00c1ngel, en fibras met\u00e1licas; Ofelia, en borregos y David, en su taxi.\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en comunidad a lado del taxi de Don David, \u00e9l viste camisa blanca y Do\u00f1a Filiberta es quien tiene las trenzas es un peinado caracter\u00edstico de la regi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n viste chaleco rojo.*\n\n","en":"The group La Luz del Saber was founded in a community where most of the population works selling cleaning products or manufacturing scouring pads and sponges, specifically.\r\n\r\nFiliberta is a very hard worker. Unfortunately she lost her husband at a very young age, but she had the strength to raise her six children. Now she is very happy and proud of her large family. She has twenty grandchildren and six great grandchildren who fill her with joy. At her 61 years of age, Filiberta still works selling cleaning products, as well as embroidery. When her children were little and she was left by herself, she knew that she had to work in order to have enough money, so she started selling fish on the local streets. She was in this business for five years, but sometimes she wasn't able to sell all of her product and some of it would spoil, which meant significant losses. Then she started selling cleaning products and household items like kitchen towels, spoons, spatulas, tongs, and other things. She now has 23 years of experience in this line of business.  \r\n\r\nFor Filiberta, VisionFund has been of great help. It has enabled her to invest more, have more merchandise, and make payments more easily. \"It really has been of great help, because this way I was able to provide for my children and cover my expenses, among other things,\" Filiberta mentioned. She currently doesn't have as much energy as she used to, and can't cover the squares and markets like before. That is why she started embroidering napkins and tablecloths, in order to make some extra money.\r\n\r\nShe will invest this new loan in cleaning products, as well as in fabric, thread, and yarn. She looks forward to keeping both businesses running, because this will allow her to continue supporting herself.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Mois\u00e9s, who will buy cleaning products; Gregoria and Aurora, who will invest in their grocery store; \u00c1ngel, who will purchase metal fibers; Ofelia, who will by lambs; and David, who will invest in his taxi cab.\r\n\r\nThe picture was taken as a group next to David's taxi cab. He is wearing a white shirt, and Filiberta is the woman wearing her hair braided in the traditional way of this region. She is also wearing a red vest.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4200,"image":{"id":1849371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Mourice also decided to purchase a solar light as part of his loan, which he is very excited about, as it will allow him to have light during dark hours for his children to be able to study.<br \/><br \/>Obtaining this loan means that Mourice's Group will be able to receive a total of three solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of four acres."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1807489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"kakamega south","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-14T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-14T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mourice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Penina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anjelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evalyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":54380,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54380}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-14T17:33:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":867545,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatuma is a married mother of five children, all of whom attend school.

is a 24 years old resident of the small region called Rudaki. In Tajikistan many streets, regions and cities were renamed in honor of the great writers and scientists of the Tajik people. Rudaki was named in honor of the founder of classical literature. \r\n\r\nTakhmina is married and has two children. Her husband works as a taxi driver. Takhmina uses all her time on her children and household chores, and if she has additional time she works with sewing. It is difficult for her to take orders for sewing, because she does not have a lot of time left. However, she tries to bring a source of income to their home and help her husband. \r\n\r\nTakhmina applied for a loan in order to renovate their home. She cares for her children and would like them to live in a safe environment. Their home urgently needs renovation.

Since she was little, she has always been interested in styling and cutting hair. Thus, when she had the opportunity, she went to beauty school for 2 years. Ten years ago, she was able to open her own beauty salon, and although things were difficult at the beginning due to her lack of experience and customers, she kept on working to make a name for herself. \r\n\r\nShe recalls that the first loan from VisionFund along with her savings helped her to buy the furnishings for her salon, which is set up in the living room of her house. Guadalupe needs a new loan to buy an electric shaver and tongs so that she can continue to offer good service. \"I am truly grateful for the support I am receiving,\" she comments with regard to the small investments she has been able to make in order to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAlthough she offers her service in her home, Guadalupe also often goes to her customers' homes to provide special services for events such as weddings and 15th birthday parties. One of her daughters is following in her footsteps and always helps her with the most modern hairstyles. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe's dream is to have a shop in the center of her town. She lives 30 minutes away from there, and she has observed that she would be able to have more customers in that location.

He lives with his family in Iganga, but is originally from Tororo in Eastern Uganda. Stephen started out in business as an entrepreneur selling essential commodities like tea and sugar, having dropped out of junior high school due to a lack of tuition fees. He supplemented his business by selling children\u2019s clothes. It was while doing this that Amuza, an UpEnergy Sales Executive, introduced him to the business of selling improved cook stoves. Realizing that the demand for the product was high, and that he enjoyed a lot selling energy-efficient stoves, Stephen decided to become an UpEnergy distribution partner as well. He has been successfully selling UpEnergy products for three years now. He attributes his success to the healthy margins and uniqueness of the product on the Ugandan market, as well as the well-managed operations at UpEnergy, meaning a quick and reliable service. In addition to earning a living from the sale of the product, entrepreneurship and building a successful business are very important to him. He is also proud to be able to improve the livelihood of people in the communities who are able to save from improved fuel use. These savings are being channeled to other expenses like school fees for children or housing expenses, as well as enabling families to avoid the dangers of open fires, which is common with the use of three stone fires. His aspiration is to be able to grow his business, so that he can be able to see his children through school and ensure that they have a better life. The loan will make it possible for Stephen to scale up his business, and allow him to increase his stock, so that he saves time and transportation cost by not having to travel as often, to replenish his stock in order to meet the high demand on stoves.  A portion of the loan will also go toward leasing a tricycle that will make it easy for him to reach the rural communities and reduce on transportation costs that currently eat up most of his margins.   \n\n\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2376.17,"image":{"id":1837343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","themes":["Innovative Loans","Green"],"use":"To pay for products and aquire a trycycle for transportation of products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Iganga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.609167 33.468611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":290,"posted_date":"2015-04-14T20:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-14T20:50:08Z","loan_amount":3700,"lender_count":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":68.55,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":10900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":3700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5800000},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1968.81},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.84},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.84},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.84},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.84},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.84},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1937.03,"local_amount":5800000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5837481.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":31.78,"payment_id":681547983},{"amount":93.83,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":301938.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.01,"payment_id":696753299},{"amount":90.55,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":301938.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.29,"payment_id":711685236},{"amount":90.43,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-02T13:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":301938.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.41,"payment_id":731189423},{"amount":95.78,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-02T13:10:37Z","rounded_local_amount":301938.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.06,"payment_id":752277676}],"funded_date":"2015-04-21T04:35:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":857219,"name":"Sajida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sajida is a 37-year-old married woman and a mother of three children.

Sarmistha is one of the member who has taken a great role for her development and their group members' livelihood improvement. \n\nThe lady who is standing first person from the right-hand side with a raised hand in the photo is Sarmistha. She is about 32 years old and is living with her small family of her husband and two children. \n\nSarmistha has been engaged in a tailoring activity at her own home of Ganganagar since four years ago. Through this business she earns a monthly income of 7,500 INR. Her opinion is that her income is not sufficient to maintain her family, with sufficient surplus for a total investment in the business to materialize her dreams. So to get more and more income by the expansion of her business, she planned to improve her business in the course of loan. She will take the loan and will purchase clothes, threads and related items, as well as a sewing machine from the market. Post disbursement of loan, the most significant thing is that she has to repair her tailoring machine, which is giving low performance. She hopes to get more and more profit from her business expansion and save money for the construction of a house and provide a better education to her children.\n\nThe other four members of her group are also smart at their professions, which include vegetable vending, a milk business, a breakfast shop and a general store. All group members will purchase their required goods and items for the development of their businesses.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1837422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase lots of threads, clothes and a sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhubaneswar, Khurda, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2015-04-14T21:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-14T21:10:13Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madhusmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandhyarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarmistha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Urupa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-20T18:15:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":857880,"name":"Luis Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis Alberto es un hombre casado, padre de tres hijos todos ellos adolescentes, su trabajo consiste en la distribuci\u00f3n de agua potable, una actividad muy com\u00fan en una zona como cerete que no cuenta con agua potable, y de mucha actividad deportiva en donde los clubes b\u00e1sicamente informarles de futbol, busca este tipo de personas para comprar el siniestro suficiente para sus deportistas.\n\nLuis Alberto les ofrece una alternativa, su responsabilidad con sus pedidos, su gentileza, amabilidad y honestidad hacen que las personas le sigan pidiendo y de hacer de esta una actividad digna para el mantenimiento de su familia.\n\nSu prop\u00f3sito con su negocio es poder pagar la educaci\u00f3n universitaria de sus hijos y apoyado en pr\u00e9stamos de financiamiento sabe que lo puede lograr y pagara muy cumplido como el hombre responsable que es.\n\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo el cual invertir\u00e1 en la compra de agua en cantidades aprovechando que el carro distribuidor est\u00e1 pr\u00f3ximo a llegar, esto le permitir\u00e1 tener un suministro para operar por un periodo de un mes o mes y medio dependiendo de las ventas.\n\n\n\n\n\n","en":"Luis Alberto is a married man, the father of three teenage children.

So to get more and more income by expansion of her business, she planned to improve her business over the course of the loan. With the loan, she plans to purchase rice, oil, sugar, tea, washing powder, soap, shampoo, biscuits, snacks, and other items for the expansion of her business. She hopes to get more and more profit from her business expansion and save money for construction of a house and to provide better education to her children.\n\nThe other three members of her group are also smart in their professions like tailoring, local line business and diary firm, respectively.

Betty also decided to purchase two solar lights as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Betty's Group will be able to receive a total of 5 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 4 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1808236,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase two solar lights and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"kakamega south","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-14T22:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-14T22:30:03Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elijah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":64350,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T11:16:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Revie","image":692978}},{"id":867812,"name":"Albertina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Albertina, vive con tres hijos en edades de 10, 7 y 5 a\u00f1os, ellos son dependientes, desde hace 20 a\u00f1os pr\u00e1ctica la jarcia y la crianza de cerdos, lo hace a tiempo completo, sus hijos le apoyan en dichas actividades cuando regresan de la escuela.\nComprar\u00e1 dos cerdos y concentrado para alimentarlos, fortalecer\u00e1 su negocio para mantener su continuidad, espera poder aumentar la competitividad de su negocio y recuperar la inversi\u00f3n con mejores ganancias.\nSus aspiraciones son tener recursos econ\u00f3micos para cubrir los gastos de estudio de sus hijos.\n","en":"Albertina lives with three children who are 10, 7, and 5 years old who are dependent on her.

These repairs will allow him to cut costs related to outsourcing his business and therefore improve his margin. \r\n\r\nIn the next five years, Tieho plans to own more transport vehicles and create many jobs.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":341.68,"image":{"id":1855346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To buy new engine parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Freedom Park, Soweto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":445,"posted_date":"2015-04-15T02:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-15T02:10:10Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.4,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tieho","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZAR","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2016-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1010.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696728864},{"amount":82.4,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T18:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1010.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.02,"payment_id":711660354},{"amount":84.16,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:06:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1010.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.26,"payment_id":731164797},{"amount":77.3,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:23:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1010.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.12,"payment_id":752252559}],"funded_date":"2015-04-16T00:10:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":867768,"name":"Alwyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alwyn (39), is a family man with a full house.

Tikemani is an inhabitant of this village. The lady standing in the middle with raised hand in the photo is Tikemani. She is 33 and resides with her husband, son and daughter. Manual blacksmith work is the main source of income for Tikemani. This is her traditional work. She and her husband work for eight hours daily to repair and make agricultural tools like a share, hoe, axe, sickle, pixeshark, pick axe etc. From this work, she earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR. From this scanty income, Tikemani is managing her house. Due to this small income, she is not able to improve her living condition. So to overcome this situation, in March 2015 she formed a Self Help Group (SHG) comprised of 10 members and took a total loan of 140,000 INR from Mahashakti Foundation. Looking at the coming agricultural season, from her loan of 16,000 INR, Tikemani is planning to purchase raw iron in bulk for making more quantities of shares, sickles and axes.

Pour sa quatri\u00e8me  ann\u00e9e avec myAgro, Moussoni a achet\u00e9 un paquet de semences OPV et d'engrais pour la culture d'arachide pour son champ de 0.25 hectares. A travers cet achat, Moussoni esp\u00e8re pouvoir augmenter ses rendements  afin de pouvoir construire sa maison avec t\u00f4le  et assurer l\u2019autosuffisance alimentaire dans la famille, ce qui garantit la paix, ajoute-t-elle.\r\n\r\nMoussoni is seated in the very front in a light green headscarf in the photo, and is a member of a group of 8 female farmers who work and live in Sido village southeast of Bamako in Mali. Moussoni, who is 46 years old, lives in a family composed of 50 people, 16 of whom are children. Farming allows her to provide for her family's food needs. She decided to sign up for a second year with myAgro in order to access quality seeds and have a good yield. myAgro changed her work by introducing new agricultural techniques. For her fourth year with myAgro, Moussoni purchased a packet of certified seed and fertilizer to grow peanuts on her .25 hectare field. With this purchase she hopes to increase her yield and be able to build her house with aluminum, and provide for her family's food needs, because she says this keeps things peaceful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1851545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy a packet of certified seed and fertilizer to grow peanuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sido ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-04-15T06:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-15T06:30:06Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moussoni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djenebou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doussouba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":152310.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401551}],"funded_date":"2015-04-16T02:46:08Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:14:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathy Guis","image":2014804}},{"id":867821,"name":"Alok Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lalita, age 25, is the leader of Alok group and hails from BCCPada, Bhawanipatna district, Odisha, India.

Meet Rose, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Nyamira area of Kenya, near the famous lake Victoria. Rose, 21, has been farming for the past 10 years. \r\n\r\nOver the years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been bananas, milk, eggs, maize, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. \r\n\r\nRose is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable, and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. \r\n\r\nKenya's Nyamira area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Rose could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Rose, but she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. \r\n\r\nRose believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business.

She sells door-to-door. She goes out three or four days each week in her free time and she also sells in her house where her most known customers come. She takes advantage of selling them to the fishermen when they come to the beaches, since it is then when they have the most money to make purchases. She also gives part of the loan to her husband so that he will use it in his fishing tasks. She has been doing this work for more than 2 years, with which she entertains herself and earns something for herself. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to purchase all sorts of clothing and fishing material. She has been in the communal bank group for 6 months and she likes it because the loans are fast. Her dream is to have her own house since they rent where they live.

She has higher education and a job. For many years she has additionally worked with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. Thanks to persistent work, she currently has three cows on her farm. She also grows haricots for own use on a rented plot of land of 3.0 hectares. \r\n\r\nZhyldyz' monthly income is around 16,000 som (KGS). This money is unfortunately not enough for a decent life, and therefore she decided to expand her business. She turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase a heifer and ten sheep. She plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of livestock.
