Her goal today is to lead groups of vendors while promoting this multilevel enterprise.\r\n\r\nAlthough Rosa's challenge is to recover her assets effectively, enabling her to repay her monthly quotas, matters has gone very well. However, Rosa still needs additional working capital if she is to increase the rotation of her inventories, earning more and having sufficient available money to respond to obligations.

Almost all products are essential household items and food. She earns an income by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling them piece by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Norberta earns a minimum net income of PHP 1,000 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations at her general store she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items, such as rice, canned goods, instant noodles, biscuits, soda and other grocery stuffs. Norberta is positive that as she expands her business it will boost her income. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her.\r\n\r\nNorberta hopes to maintain and grow her business to enable her to save for old age. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.

Now it's time for you to meet one of Ruma's agents, Bahudin. Bahudin lives in East Serang, a suburban area located about two hours' drive from Jakarta, the capital city. He lives there with his wife and his two children. Bahudin owns a stall that sells small snacks and drinks and mobile airtime credits for his community. He is a hardworking man, and his community sees him as a friendly and trustworthy mobile provider. Bahudin decided to join Ruma last year because he wants to learn how to expand his business using technology. As the business grows, Bahudin needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits for his community, so his community can connect with their loved ones, no matter how far they are apart. Bahudin\u2019s goal in the near future is to serve as an e-commerce business for his community, with Ruma\u2019s latest product called Mapan. As seen in the photo, Bahudin is sitting in his own stall.

His business is selling bookstore items.\r\nHe is a good father, he is patient, entrepreneurial, reasonable, consistent, responsible and hard working. He carries out his business in the area called 'villa Copacabana' which is in the eastern area of la Ciudad. It is a place where the traffic meets. It also has different types of businesses. The area is also known and 'La Villa' and it has a lot of need for infrastructure, basic services, security for the people, green areas and sports fields for children and young people. \r\nRene is dark-skinned, short grey hair, brown eyes, is short and is of medium build. His native language is Aymara which he speaks with his family and he speaks Spanish because of the general culture and also for his business. He shares his life with his wife who works in the same business and with his daughter who works. They live in a rented house built from bricks and cement with a roof made of corrugated iron. It has drinking water, electricity and a sewage system. His business is selling bookstore items such as coloured pencils, notebooks of all sizes, sheets of paper of all types, etc. He does this every day of the week in his bookstore situated in his home. He says 'I started my business with my wife, it is going well for us and we work together...'. The advantage of his business is that there is no competition in the area as it is a remote area. The disadvantage is that it is remote and so to get his products he needs to travel long distances. His dream is to have a home, he wants to expand his business by buying a photocopying machine in order to offer another service. This is his first loan cycle with the institution in the three years that he has been doing this work.\r\nIt is for these reasons that Rene is asking for a loan to buy a photocopying machine in order to offer a new service and then buy himself a house with the profits.

Sira, who is 40 years old, is the mother of 9 children, 4 of whom have attended school at this point. Her family's tradition in farming, which has been the primary source of revenue and food for the household, is why Sira got started farming 30 years ago. Sira grows peanuts on her farm and faces challenges such as the lack of rain and agricultural materials. Sira is in her second year with myAgro, and signed up again because she wants to increase her yield through myAgro's services, and due to the positive impact myAgro had during the previous growing season. This year Sira is making payments to purchase a packet of myAgro certified seed and fertilizer to grow peanuts and increase her yield on her .125-hectare holding. It has now been more than 18 years since Sira started growing peanuts for their value as a staple and cash crop, and due to a lack of cultivable space.

She is 31 years old and she resides with her family in Tondo, Manila, Philippines. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for four years, and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner, Welfredo, are working hard with the determination to have a better income, and be able to provide their children with a better education.<br \/><br \/>In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.<br \/><br \/>To improve sales, Melanie would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. With an amount of 18,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.<br \/><br \/>Melanie hopes to maintain an increasing profit from her business. She dreams for her children to finish schooling. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Gaitano also decided to purchase a solar light as part of his loan, which he is very excited about, as it will allow him to have light during dark hours for his children to be able to study.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Gaitano's Group will be able to receive a total of 6 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 11.25 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1808148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"kakamega south","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-16T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-16T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gaitano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wycliff","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ignatius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilymina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sylvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen Khasiala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linet Iminza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence Musinya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacinta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Merceline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gerald Murunga","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":152190,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152190}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kristin Simpson","image":null}},{"id":867703,"name":"Narinder","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Narinder thanks all the Kiva lenders for helping him in his financial need.\r\nHe has repaid his previous loan fully and on time and with the profits he could save for his family's future.\r\nNarinder wants to save for a rice plot and for this he must continue with rice cultivation.

She sold from a cart for the first year, but then was able to set up the small cafe that she's run for the past nine years.   \r\n\r\nThe cafe has been closed for three months because a mayoral election campaign forced the withdrawal of all vendors from the park. Ligia is applying for a loan to invest in the purchase of supplies and merchandise to restart the business. She also wants to invest part of the loan funds in starting a business selling  clothing in the neighborhoods and towns near her home.  \r\n\r\nLigia hopes that her business will continue to grow. She'd also like to open new cafes and clothing shops so that she can earn more income and provide a better quality of life for her children.

Ahora que ha iniciado la primavera, las personas disfrutan de una vista agradable gracias al verde de los campos. \nDon Francisco es un hombre muy amable y alegre, tiene 51 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casado con la se\u00f1ora Carmen quien se dedica a su hogar y son padres de 4 hijos, todos ellos independientes. \nDesde hace 8 a\u00f1os don Francisco se ha dedicado a la cr\u00eda y engorda de borregos, los compra desde peque\u00f1os y los conserva durante seis meses para despu\u00e9s venderlos a las personas de la comunidad que venden barbacoa, platillo tradicional de la regi\u00f3n.

He is married to Se\u00f1ora Carmen, who takes care of their home, and they are the parents of four children, all of them independent.\r\n\r\nFor 8 years Don Francisco has raised sheep. He buys them when they are young, and he keeps them for six months to later sell them to people in the community who sell barbeque, a traditional dish in the region. In addition, Francisco works in the fields and in construction, while his wife is the one who helps him with the care of the animals.\r\n\r\nNow Francisco has 25 sheep at home. \"We take advantage of the fields so that we don't buy food, corn, or fodder. The sheep eat the grass that grows in the fields.\" This is the first time that Francisco has applied to VisionFund for a loan, and he will use it to buy three more sheep.\r\n\r\nAll the members are very happy and grateful for their loans because they will have more capital to invest in their businesses. They recognize that they have a great responsibility to the institution and they are committed to making their best effort to make their payments punctually. Their dream is to be able to continue increasing their sales in order to improve their quality of life and that of their children.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Teresa and Benito, who will invest in turkeys; Cecilia and Edelia, in sheep; and Elizabeth, in tomatoes.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken on the steps of the town where the members live.

Installing a water filtration system will save the school money in the long-term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

Her children are now grown up and independent. Twenty years ago Zoya started to work in animal husbandry and farming. Thanks to her perseverance and determination, Zoya achieved good results and today she has cows and horses on her farm. On her 1.5 hectare plot she grows potatoes, which she sells along with milk. In order to increase her herd, Zoya turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 150,000 KGS to purchase two calves and twenty sheep.

The ladies help and encourage each other to be leaders in their community as well as in their homes. They share the responsibility of bringing income into their families along with their husbands. Their common goals are to bring a higher quality of life to their children and to be positive examples to other women in their community.\n\nThe ladies have various businesses including animal husbandry (chickens and pigs), and traditional textile production (\u201cblusas\u201d or ornate lightweight blouses, \u201chuipiles\u201d or heavier woven\/embroidered blouses, \u201cboinas\u201d or berets, and hats). As there are numerous orchards in the area, other women have businesses growing and selling fruit such as apples, passion fruit, lemons, peaches and plums.\n\nTomasa is the Secretary of the Trust Bank as she is the only one who knows how to read and write. She was able to attend primary school until the 4th grade. Tomasa is the mother of one son. She is requesting a loan to invest in the purchase of various colors of thread and other supplies for her traditional textile business.

This is John. He is the head teacher of Kawempe Royal College, a mixed school of 600 students in the urban area of Kawempe in Kampala. \r\n\r\nKawempe Royal School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistently clean drinking water, and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nKawempe Royal School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. John ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":411.81,"image":{"id":1856123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for the students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-04-16T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-16T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.47,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kawempe Royal School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3685000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2017-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":650000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.9},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.9},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.9},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.9},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":203.27,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":612549.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.64,"payment_id":681370897},{"amount":201.07,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:11:55Z","rounded_local_amount":612549.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.83,"payment_id":755507148}],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T05:56:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":868339,"name":"Sylvia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sylvia is a single mother with two children, both of whom attend school.

In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP1000 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business she is requesting a PHP15000 loan which she will use to buy some grocery items. She will also pay for the new sewing machines shown in her photo which she will use to sew clothes as a subcontractor of a garments factory. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her, and a good return of her investment for it will surely meet their daily expense and to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nTeresita hopes to maintain and grow her business so she they could have a better life. She strives hard to give her children the best education possible, and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her oldest son is in another country looking for work. It became difficult for his mother to raise five children on her own, so he married and left to find work. The four younger children are in school. Like many women in her country, Latofat sews for a living.

In Tajikistan's climate, houses frequently need to be repaired, but Latofat's house has not been repaired for many years.

Nurinisso is married and has children. She lives with her mother, father, and children in Qubadiyon. Her husband is working out of the country in the Russian Federation because he could not find suitable work in Tajikistan.\r\n\r\nNurinisso does agricultural work. She grows wheat, potatoes, and greens. Nurinisso is a hard-working and honest woman. She also sells children's clothing in the market.
