She lives in a rental house with electricity but no running water, and her greatest monthly expenses are food, clothing, and rent bills.

lives in the Vakhsh region.  He is 54 years old, is married and has 5 children.  Urozali has a high school education.  He plants wheat on his plot of land.  Every year he has a decent harvest, which he then sells at the local market.  Right now, Urozali would like to take out a loan to purchase wheat seeds and to get the land ready for planting.  He will use the loan to purchase fertilizer, to pay for a tractor rental and to pay for fuel.  He plans to pay back the loan over 10 months. \r\n\r\nUrozali has a big family and in addition to growing wheat they also have an orchard and grow apples.  This provides them with an additional source of income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva

To make a living, Satelite owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a tailoring business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Satelite has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 650 tala WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2006, Satelite joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Satelite has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 tala WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase new sewing machine.  Satelite is now requesting a new loan of 1500 tala WST which will be used to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Satelite plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

has a successful business selling foodstuffs at a market in Rudaki, Tajikistan. He started his business about 13 years ago, after evaluating different business possibilities and deciding this would be the best option and something he would enjoy. Radjab purchases produce at very low prices and then resells at a profit. Because he sells in bulk, he deals with a high inventory turnover rate. Radjab rents a very good location at the market for his business, and he has little competition. He has requested a loan of $800 US to increase his business capital. This loan will give him the ability to purchase more produce to sell, enabling him to increase his profits and continue operating a profitable business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

Turi is known as the place to view the city of Cuenca because from there you can admire almost the entire city. It's older adults and women work mainly in agriculture and the youngest people have migrated to other cities in and out of the country, seeking better days for their families. The members of this bank are fighters who day to day look for opportunites to offer their families a better present and future. On this occasion a little girl, daughter of one of the members, is with us.  \r\n \r\nMrs. Mar\u00eda  Lourdes L. has been a member of this bank for five cyles. She lives in the outskirts of Cuenca in her own little house. She lives with her three children, 12, 10 and 8. The father of the children does not support them at all. The children are students in the local elementary school. \r\n\r\n Mar\u00eda Lourdes, at 56, buys lumber. She cuts it and makes boards, strips, beams, etc. She has been doing this for 10 years and works Monday to Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. She also raises animals such as pigs and chickens, which she sells in the area markets.  \r\n\r\nShe joined the communal bank thanks to a friend who was a member of the little bank. The loans she has obtained have benefitted the economic stability of her home and the growth of her business. With the new credit, she is going to buy more pigs and feed to raise and sell them. Her biggest dream is to be able to have a lumber warehouse.\r\n\r\nBlanca E. has also been a member of this bank for 8 cycles. She was invited by a friend to join the bank. The loans have helped her to start her business. She has sold fast food for 5 years. She rents a locale close to her home and works from Monday to Sunday. Previously she was the only person sellling in the area but now she has competition.  She works from 12 a.m. to 2 p.m. and later she goes out to sell from 4 p.m. until 9 pm.\r\n\r\nBlanca is 51 years old. She was widowed 5 years ago. Her husband died of a hepatic coma. She had four children from her marriage. They are 29, 26,  20 and 18. Her two oldest daughters are married and independent. Her 20 year old son studies at the university and her youngest son works and he helps her out financially in the home. She does not own a home and so they rent. She will invest the new loan in fixing her cart, which is her work equipment. Her dream is to have a minimarket. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and a sugarcane business. Her husband Guillermo, who is 45 years old, works as a truck driver to earn his living and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 13 and 23 years old. \r\n\r\nAgnes joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Agnes has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,500 - uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 20th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use to buy sugarcane fertilizer and stocks for the general store so that she can continue to save up for their future and do home repairs. Agnes O. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":552972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Grace is 16 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala West region of Uganda.  She is single and has no children.   Grace has a business of selling charcoal, which she has had for three years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Grace has requested a loan of 300,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy more charcoal to sell.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Grace hopes to generate greater profits in order to help buy food at home and pay school fees.  In the future, Grace hopes to study up to the university level.       \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in micro-finance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":581707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

Komi A. was born on July 15, 1967 to a poor family in Lom\u00e9. Not having enough money to go far away for his studies, he decided to learn carpentry and thus receive profesionnal training. Now married and the father of three (03) children, he has his own workshop. He is dynamic and innovative, and attracts clients by displaying his products outside. But without modern tools, he continues to work by hand, which makes production extremely slow. He would therefore like to supply his workshop with more effective equipment for faster, more refined work. To do this, he is asking for a $1500 credit that will enable him to buy two machines that can handle all the necessary carpentry work. This will mean that he does not have to transport wood to other workshops, and can cut his costs. Realizing this plan will allow him to increase his production and his income to meet the needs of his family.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Lisa Molle, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMonsieur A.

(0) is a 41-year-old woman living in the town of Manono Tai.  She is married and has 5 school-aged children.  To make a living, Tauvela owns & operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community.  Tauvela has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 550 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2004, Tauvela joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Tauvela has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  Tauvela is now requesting a new loan of 1650 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Tauvela plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":253380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

S., 43 years old, lives in Apaneca, in Ahuachap\u00e1n department. He lives with his wife and four underage children, which go to the local school. Narciso is a very hardworking man of whom his neighbours speak very well. They say he is a very quiet, hardworking and responsible person, always striving to improve his family's life conditions. He lost his job a few years ago, and given the difficulties in finding a new one, he decided to start his own business, which is a general store selling perishable products and first necessity products located in his home. For Narciso it is very important to stock up the business because it is the only way he can obtain bigger earnings. This is why he asks for a loan with which he can purchase basic grains, candy and soft drinks, which are the products he sells best. This thrills Narciso, who hopes to obtain greater earnings which will enable him to offer financial stability to his family. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cecilia Piris, Kiva

She and her husband produce fruits and vegetables. What they urgently need right now are fertilizers and other chemicals for the care of their crops so that they can produce a product that is in line with the demands of the market.\r\n\r\nFatima needs your help to buy the fertilizers, which are the most expensive and most necessary inputs for producing of her fruits. The goal is to achieve better profits and benefits in the market. Fatima doesn\u2019t just need good land; she also needs a friendly hand to help her out.   \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":531847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

of hard work and vigor. N. Jalia has, for the last seven years, given a worthy account of herself in a male-dominated business \u2013 to wit: a secondhand shoe enterprise \u2013 in Lugazi.\r\n\r\nLike many other Ugandan women seeking to scrape out their own way to make ends meet, Jalia knew she had to go with the contemporary tide to guarantee for herself and her seven children a safe, sound and secure future. Prior to obtaining this footing in her current business, she was a milk-seller. She used the proceeds from her milk-sales business to start up this secondhand shoe business, with the help of a loan.\r\n\r\nWith a steady profit inflow, principally the 60,000 shillings she makes in a week, Jalia has managed to educate all her children. With this loan, her sense of optimism is sky-high, especially knowing that she will be able to purchase more shoes to sell.

is 27 year-old Lalita S..  She is married and has two children, ages five and one. In 2007, she established  her grocery store business. She Supports her family by working 7 days a week, 8 hours a day.  She has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buys grocery goods like rice, maize, and snacks for her business. In the future, Lalita plans to improve the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called a pasal, are an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce and milk, and staples like rice, lentils, and flour, are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profits.  By keeping lots of inventory and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. This loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women in the home and community.

So when she got married, she started doing it for herself from the little money given to her by her husband. She now enjoys doing business because she almost solves all of her problems and is able to assist her husband in taking care of the home.  \r\n\r\nWorking 6 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 1,000,000 SLL every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of 4,000,000 SLL. She requires a loan in order to buy 10 cartons @ 72,000 SLL, mayonaise - 10 cartons @ 190,000 SLL, sugar (cube) - 10 cartons @ 100,000 SLL and soft drinks - 10 crates @ 35,000 SLL. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 250,000 SLL. She is convinced that in acquiring this loan, her shop will expand more than before, and she even hopes to establish another outlet so that she can assign one of her brothers to be selling there. With a second outlet she could realize more profits and therefore help her husband greatly in taking care of the home. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes to acquire a piece of land and educate her children as well. Some of the profit has been put back into the business and some used to solve domestic problems. She has a plan to expand and continue accessing loans from Kiva partner Association for Rural Development. She is a very hardworking and dedicated woman with a good vision.

T. R. , 38, has a little store (a tienda) up in the hills above Nebaj. Her house and store are surrounded by cornfields, but her family does not own any land beyond their house. She opened the tienda two years ago when she received her first loan. In her tienda she sells water, juice, bananas, oil, salt, fruits and other staples that her neighbors will stop by and purchase. Because there is not much work for the people in her town, they did not have money to buy her weavings so she turned to operating a tienda as a continuing source of income.\r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nMaria is married and has 7 children. The youngest two school-age children have not started school yet because she does not have the money for clothes and school supplies. She herself never attended school and therefore cannot read, write, or do addition. Her older children help her in the tienda when there are sums to be done. Their schooling is already paying off. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nMaria does still do some weaving. Her specialty is weaving huipils, a traditional top worn by most women in the village of Nebaj. She can produce one in 15 days and sells in the market for up to US$200. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nEven though her husband makes money driving a little three-wheeled taxi (called a tuc-tuc, pronounced Tuuk-Tuuk), her dream is to have enough food daily to feed her family.  A major struggle is buying medicine for when a member of her family is ill which luckily is not often. As they say here, \"Gracias a Dios.\" Even aspirin and anti-acid medicine are extra expenses that are hard to fit into the family's limited budget.\r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nWritten by Nancy Lewis and Randy Fay, Kiva fellows"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":53360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase stock for her store and yarn for weaving","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Nebaj, Quiche","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.405833 -91.146111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2007-08-09T21:45:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-24T02:53:46Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2007-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2007-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2007-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2008-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2008-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2008-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":88.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2007-09-24T09:18:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":58138},{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2007-10-24T09:19:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71368},{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2007-11-24T10:21:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85998},{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2007-12-24T10:18:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":102021},{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2008-01-24T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":121003},{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2008-02-24T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":141260},{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164986},{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2008-04-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":190645},{"amount":88,"local_amount":88,"processed_date":"2008-05-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":218159}],"funded_date":"2007-08-10T02:53:46Z","paid_date":"2008-05-24T09:03:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":19899,"name":"Edgar","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Edgar is 23 years old.

Hope. Thirty women belong to Mujeres Valientes, and 20 of them have successfully repaid previous loans. Jesula's group has ten women. The loan will be shared among the members of the group, who run various businesses.\r\n\r\nJesula is 29 years old; her husband is 30. They have two girls, 11 and 12 years old. Jesula runs a business selling clothes and shoes. She usually buys her merchandise in Santiago and resells for a profit in Cabarete, which is a tourist destination. Her customers are from Haiti and the Dominican Republic. She does not sell to tourists because because she does not speak English. \r\n\r\nJesula has repaid two loans from Esperanza. This will be her third loan. These loans made it possible for Jesula to start her business. She used her first loan to stock clothing. With the second loan, she branched out into shoes and expanded her clothing inventory. She plans to use the third loan to diversify her business further by stocking perfume and soap as well. \r\n\r\nIn her spare time Jesula likes to read the Bible, and also books on child rearing and running a household. Her dream is to have her own shop in the center of Cabarete, where she could attract the tourist trade. Today she lives in a rented house, and she hopes that one day she will be able to buy her own house. She also hopes that her children will have an opportunity to study at the university.

So she works to help her husband with the basic household costs like the electric bill, the water bill, and study materials for their three children who are in primary school. For several years she has worked for a Chinese company, but in the last few months everything has changed. She worries that they will close the plant because of the economic situation in the country. The reason she wants a loan is because her salary and that of her husband are not enough to be able to buy the material to build a sidewalk in front of their house. With the loan she could begin to build the walk, which will be cleaner and more hiegenic for her family. She will buy stone, sand, and cement to complete the work. She is happy for the opportunity to receive a loan because the payment schedule and the low interest will help her make home improvements in the short term.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick King, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":441464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of materials to build a walkway","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-12-06T14:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sugey Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.45,"local_amount":1129.04,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1172.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003308},{"amount":56.76,"local_amount":1135.21,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1178.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841470},{"amount":55.96,"local_amount":1119.15,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1161.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874390},{"amount":112.01,"local_amount":2240.19,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2325.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604274},{"amount":55.69,"local_amount":1113.88,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1156.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821521},{"amount":55.77,"local_amount":1115.4,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1157.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561527},{"amount":54.96,"local_amount":1099.16,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1141.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770469},{"amount":52.4,"local_amount":1047.97,"processed_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1087.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204366}],"funded_date":"2009-12-27T15:36:34Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick  King","image":null}},{"id":163556,"name":"Joyce Mwelu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce sells secondhand clothes, such as skirts and T-shirts, to frequent customers and passers-by in the open-air Gikomba Market.

This will be the group\u2019s second loan from Fundacion Mujer. The first was for 100,000 colones for each group member, and was paid back on time and in full. The members of this group live in Coto Brus, Puntarenas, a rural community located in the southern region of Costa Rica near the Panamanian border.\r\n\r\nThese women are in the business of animal rearing. They work with cows, pigs and chickens. This loan will be used for the purchase of animals as well as general investments in activities conducive to the healthy upbringing of animal livestock such as food, shelter and nutrients.\r\n\r\nCows, pigs and chickens are raised by the women until they are ready to be sold. Chickens are generally sold in the community, to neighbors, friends and acquaintances, whereas pigs and cows are sold to purchasers who travel to the community from nearby cities. These purchasers can be middlemen\/women who will resell the pigs or cows to butchers for final use. The purchasers may also be the butchers themselves.\r\n\r\nThe group members\u2019 families benefit greatly from their livestock businesses. In general, the women have the goal of rendering the earnings generated through their sales more stable by acquiring more livestock and seeking out new clients. An obstacle for the group has been the unpredictable effects of animals becoming sick. Changes in climate have affected the quality and quantity of grazing land for cows as well as the susceptibility of chickens and pigs to disease.\r\n\r\nJennifer P. A. is the 21-year-old mother of two who lives in Coto Brus. She had her first child when she was sixteen years old. She has a business rearing and selling pigs which she started with an initial investment of 100,000 colons. Jennifer appreciates the importance of providing a quality product to her clients in order to keep them coming back to her instead of choosing another producer. The values she expects her group to display are responsibility, solidarity and honesty.\r\n\r\nMaritza G. P. is a 32 year old woman who lives in Coto Brus with her husband of sixteen years and their four children. She has a business rearing and selling cows. Maritza says she wants her business to grow in order to improve her quality of life and that of her family. She comments that before she was approved for her loan she was afraid; with the loan, she feels secure.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":477970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase piglets and pig feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Coto Brus","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-01-27T01:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma Estrella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380952.38},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":419047.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":702.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":772.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":703.19,"local_amount":381388.98,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":384999.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159763266},{"amount":13.47,"local_amount":7305.6,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7374.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850717},{"amount":758.34,"local_amount":411305.42,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":415199.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191428430}],"funded_date":"2010-01-27T03:05:15Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":176026,"name":"Anene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anene sells sarongs, hair gear and bags in her retail shop.

She wants to raise not only small livestock animals but cattle as well. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to see her business expand and become a wholesaler.

Mili explains that an old saying \u2013 \u201cGreatness requires the taking of risks. That is why so few ever achieve it,\u201d \u2013 inspires him to take on the challenges of owning a small business. Yes V Can provides copying, printing, binding, and other services for large construction projects, and Mili\u2019s signs - like those used to indicate projects that have received American Recovery Reinvestment Act funding - can be seen around the San Francisco Bay Area.\r\n\r\nMili prides himself on thinking outside the box to keep prices low. Recently, he successfully out-bid a large corporation for a banner project in San Francisco\u2019s Bayview neighborhood, where his shop is located. While the corporation sought to lower prices by purchasing metal brackets made in China, Mili employed an acquaintance to turn out the brackets locally. Mili kept the job local, and his fixtures were cheaper and stronger. \r\n\r\nLooking forward, Mili would like to be a \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 for all construction companies and walk-in customers who need his services. \u201cFinding customers and building trust is the difficult part,\u201d he explains. \u201cOnce I find them, I want to progress through the project with the customer.\u201d \r\n\r\nWhen Mili started Yes V Can he needed a large format printer, but without an established credit history he was unable to qualify for a loan from his bank or leasing company. Mili rented the machine from a competitor but was charged a crippling fee that was 400% above market rate. Fortunately, he was recently presented with the chance to buy his own machine and came to his local MFI, Opportunity Fund, for financing. \r\n\r\n\u201cI was in a quandary over what to do. Then I heard about Opportunity Fund, and within 2 weeks I was approved for a loan. This is a really good thing.\u201d A $5,000 loan will cover the cost of two used printers, which will allow him to take on more jobs, be more cost-effective, and grow his business. In the near future, he plans to hire an employee to help manage his increasing workload. \r\n\r\nUltimately, Mili\u2019s goal is to help and hire from his community. \u201cIt\u2019s through the community that I\u2019ve been able to do this so far \u2013 showing gratitude and giving back is very important. That\u2019s how I was raised by my parents, and I want to live by their example so my children will do the same when it is time for them to face the world!\u201d

Samar is a 32-year-old young woman. She is married with one son and one daughter. Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. Samar has old home furniture and she wants to improve her house conditions by purchasing new home furniture such as living room furniture and dinning room furniture, but she hasn't enough money to pay, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Samar gets the loan, she will change her house conditions positively by purchasing new home furniture. She will provide to her family with better home living conditions. \n\n\n\n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\n

These nine women are one of the first groups in this area to obtain a loan for their growing businesses. On top of micro-credit, these women benefit from Podemos Progresar\u2019s unique platform, which includes medical assistance, access to education, business development workshops, and legal advice. To ensure that the group takes advantage of all of the credit-plus services that Podemos Progresar provides, they have been assigned a Personal Wellbeing Mentor.\n\nFor example, people working in the Mexican formal sector have access to a medical service known as IMSS, but many entrepreneurs, people working in the informal sector, or unemployed citizens do not have access to it. Podemos Progresar introduces borrowers to and helps them register for a state-run health program known as \u201cSeguro Popular\u201d and now everyone in the \u201cLas Valentinas\u201d group has access to insurance. \n \nAnother Podemos Progresar feature is their sales catalog, which contains many household appliances, computers, and entertainment systems. The idea of the catalog is to provide essential home products to borrowers at the lowest price on the market. In addition, borrowers can sells these goods to their community and have the product delivered to their home free of charge.  This results in an additional income stream for borrowers and improved prices for the goods in the catalog for the community. \n\nGroup member Cinthia, a 26 year-old mother of one, sells perfumes from her house, and occasionally house-to-house throughout her neighborhood. She began mixing fragrances four years ago and is currently collaborating with her niece to create her own fragrance. By December, Cinthia plans to move her business out of her home and into Cahuacan, where no perfume shops currently exist.\n\nOf the nine women, only three of them have finished middle school - some, like Cinthia\u2019s mother, Silvia, have only completed primary school. Podemos Progresar\u2019s platform works to ensure that the entire group can earn their secondary school diplomas. In addition to this, they have access to discounted English and computer classes.\n\nPodemos Progresar\u2019s combination of micro-credit and aditional platform services is just the multi-dimensional solution that this group of women needs to generate sustainable businesses and wellbeing."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1368305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to make perfumes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Nicolas Romero","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":297,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3075,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cinthia Anayanci","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nayeli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evangelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":39000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.18},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":882079,"name":"Ngolo","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Ngolo est une femme  de 56 ans mari\u00e9e m\u00e8re de 5 enfants dont l'\u00e2ge varie entre 22 et 34 ans. elle commer\u00e7ante fait la vente en d\u00e9tail des vivres frais (maniocs, plantains, noix de palmes et l\u00e9gumes) en fonction des saisons dans un march\u00e9 de la place depuis 3 ans.

","en":"Maribel is 21 years old; she has been married for a year and has three children with whom she is living in a rented house.  Since she was very young she has worked and farmed her fields, but now that she has three children her needs have grown and so three years ago she threw herself into the purchase and sale of fruit which is very profitable between January and April, but not so in the other months of the year.  Because of this, she started another business: renting and selling CDs, a business which has proven very profitable because there is little competition given that her only competitor is located in a different neighbourhood.  Maribel started selling and renting movies six months ago and her satisfaction with this business is obvious.  She is making good profits as she rents each CD for 2.50 soles and sells each for 3 soles.  She sells in the evenings and buys and sells fruit on Fridays.  Maribel tells us that she tries to save the profits from these businesses in order to offset the times when fruit sales are low: the sale of CDs has become her main source of income.  In all this time, she has proven herself to be very punctual with her payments and attends all the meetings of her community bank.  This is her fifth loan with MFP and in all this time she was always repaid her installments on time.  She is asking for this loan to buy more CDs both to rent and to sell, be they music or movies.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":273410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Movie Tapes & DVDs","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase her stock of CDs to rent and sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-19T03:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":60}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":64.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117098},{"amount":20,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:42Z","rounded_local_amount":64.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012011},{"amount":20,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:36Z","rounded_local_amount":64.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595596},{"amount":20,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":64.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989858},{"amount":20,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":64.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210994},{"amount":20,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:41Z","rounded_local_amount":64.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640495},{"amount":20,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":64.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080124},{"amount":20,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":64.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996411},{"amount":20,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":64.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841944},{"amount":20,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":64.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733746}],"funded_date":"2009-02-19T06:44:23Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":93667,"name":"Selena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Selena P., 48, is married with one child.

the side. Oliva works at Bulenga Preparatory School teaching P5 and P6 English classes. The children in P5 and P6 are between 10 and 12 years old. \r\n<p>\r\n**<br>\r\nIn Uganda, the education system is broken into four sections. There are seven years of primary education, four years of lower-secondary education, two years of upper-secondary education and then three to five years of post-secondary education.<br>\r\n**\r\n<p>\r\nOlivia began her poultry business to increase the money that her family has to operate with. In her job as a teacher, Olivia earns only 120,000 USH per month. This would not be enough to support her family, since she has 6 children ranging in age from one year to fourteen years.  Although her husband also works in the market in Bulenga, five of their children are currently in private schools in the area and the total amount of school fees is very high.\r\n<p>\r\nThus, Olivia began her poultry business. She has about 100 broiler chickens (the chickens that are raised to be eaten \u2013 as opposed to those that are raised for collecting eggs). Olivia buys these chickens when they are one day old and then sells them after 5 weeks. These day-old-chickens cost 1,300 USH and she can sell them for around 5,000 USH. During the fattening period, Olivia spends 35,000 USH per week on chicken mash. This means that she makes roughly 190,000 USH profit from each stock of chickens.\r\n<p>\r\nOlivia is requesting a loan of 300,000 USH to purchase chicken mash. She says that if she were able to do anything, she would open a nursery school in Bulenga. She would buy a plot of land and build three big classrooms."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3825,"image":{"id":293988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She is 34 years old. Meriam is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Meriam owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling seafood products including fish and shrimp in the local community.  They sell it thru peddling. Meriam and her husband peddle their fish using their motorcycle around the village. Meriam has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 2500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Meriam joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Meriam has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Meriam is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP, which will be used for capital and partly as a down payment for a motorcycle. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Meriam from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support education and improvement of the house. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of food products in the local community. Liza has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2,000.00 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Liza joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Liza has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000.00 PHP from PMPC. Liza is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP, which will be used as additional capital for her sari-sari store. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Liza from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Norah wants to improve on the status quo of her family with the acquisition of this loan, as she wants to give this business an improved lease on life in terms of expansion, through restocking her shop with a vision of making it a wholesale business, and thus earning more sales revenue.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":579442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more stock like soap, sugar, salt, cooking oil, books etc. for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ibanda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.116667 30.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-08-11T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":103,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esau","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teddy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Innocent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yosam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jovanis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilber","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Quaraish","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milton","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yorokamu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geresome","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Living","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":7600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1266666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1266666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1266666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1266666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1266666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1266666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":579.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":579.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":579.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":579.17},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":579.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":579.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":556.3,"local_amount":1216665,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1222756.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903719},{"amount":528.32,"local_amount":1155469,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1161253.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297185},{"amount":565.07,"local_amount":1235832,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1242019.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467460},{"amount":539.75,"local_amount":1180467,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1186377.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605550},{"amount":707.3,"local_amount":1546902,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1554646.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744673},{"amount":578.26,"local_amount":1264665,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1270996.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191482862}],"funded_date":"2010-08-17T04:22:01Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T05:08:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":225619,"name":"Maria Cristina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la sra.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

The products that they have grown with a lot of affection and hard work have helped them a lot to progress in life.

They serve good quality food items such as Nan chanay (made with chick-peas and served with bread and salad) and Daal chawal (made with lentils and serves with rice and pickle). Each day they make the dishes fresh and never compromise on quality.     <p>\r\n\r\nMumtaz is requesting a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her sons' business so they can purchase ingredients such as chick-peas, lentils, rice, cooking oil, spices, etc. to continue generating good revenue.  She hopes that her sons will grow the business more and improve the quality of services after the loan investment.

He has had three kids, who are all independent now. He works his lands in order to support him and his wife. He has been living on this land for over 40 years. He is proud of his farm because it has allowed him to feed and educate his children. Santos only has a limited education, but through hard work and reliance on his experience, he ensures the investment in rice will be successful.  <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Santos is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":25050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Invest in Rice production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-08T15:35:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-23T05:06:33Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":96.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21383},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:10:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40769},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:03:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45288},{"amount":463,"local_amount":463,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:03:12Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":463,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99042},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T21:42:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106802}],"funded_date":"2007-04-09T05:06:33Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T21:42:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11739,"name":"Transito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<P>Transito has a small business where she sells all different types of home and personal products.

She has always fought to provide for her family and educate her 4 children, and two of them today are working adults, thanks to her example. Her perseverance has given her family the assurance that she does everything possible to make their lives pleasant.<P>\r\n\r\nThanks to the hard work she invests in agriculture, she was able to purchase a small plot of land that she is farming together with her husband. However, the produce has decreased and the family expenses are using up the little capital they have. In turn, this has reduced the amount of money available for purchasing fuels and lubricants, seeds and fertilizer for the new plot of land they have invested in. That is the reason that Malika is requesting a loan of 3000 Somoni (900 USD) for a term of 9 months. The situation in which Malika finds herself has made her ask for help, with the hope that she will find sensitive collaborators to help her get through these hard times. <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History <P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At age 27, she is responsible for the well-being of her little 4-year-old daughter.  Thanks to the support of her parents, who she lives with, she is making it.  At an early age she dedicated herself to sewing, but in order to improve her work she decide to take a dressmaking course, which helped her.  Three years ago she set up shop in a space that her mother let her use, because she saw how much Catherine really wanted to get ahead.  Now everyone in the neighborhood comes to her, asking her to repair clothing and make dresses or other articles.  The gift that she has enables her to do the work efficiently, producing quality work for her customers.  In the future she would like to rent or buy a stand in the local market, because there is more traffic in the commercial zones and the work would be better paid, since she charges low rates working from home.  Catherine has belonged to CCFP for 5 years and is in her 8th loan.  She always enjoys the company of the other group members, who are very supportive of her business.

She is 39 years old. Carmelita is married and has 7 school-aged children. To make a living, Carmelita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Carmelita has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn November 2008, Carmelita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carmelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Carmelita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Carmelita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":353242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She studied nursing, but she has never worked as a nurse because her first husband died and she had to provide for her young children with faster money. So, since 2001 she has worked selling dresses, clothing, and perfumes. This work has helped her to discover her potential as an enterprising woman. She has grown on a personal level and has increased her family income so that she now feels happy.\r\n\r\nSince 2003, Libeh y Guillermo (her new husband, who makes hand-made shoes in a workshop located at their house) have been selling the products that he makes and this is now the main business for this household. Their market is mainly in market stalls located in the  center of Barranquilla and in other cities around the country.\r\n\r\nLibeh has recieved two loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo [Kiva Field Partner]. The last one was for 2,000,000 COP, which she will invest mainly in raw materials so that her husband can make the shoes that his clients have requested; in silver jewelry; and in a variety of merchandise that her clients have requested from her. Her clients know her and expect that she will find them clothing \u00edtems that combine well with accesories and that are appropriate for different occasions. She knows her market very well and she advises her clients in a way that is valuable to them. \r\n\r\nThis family\u2019s dream is to buy their own house and they are planning to request the subsidy that the government grants to vulnerable families and to enroll in the Dreams and Opportunities program in the Villas de San Pablo development, which is run by the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. They plan to purchase a lot so they can have their own house and business in one, so they can quit spending on rent. In order to do this, they are always looking for business opportunities in towns where they haven\u2019t gone yet.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Thirty-one year old N. Esther calls to mind the time when she and her mum used to frequent the busy market area in Kame valley-Mukono. She was then still in her early teens, but she bore witness to the business of making money by hook or by crook in a noisy and boisterous environment. At length she embraced her mom\u2019s words encouraging her to join this business in her early 20\u2019s.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s now a decade since she joined the market vending business. She primarily sells Irish potatoes, cassava and yams at her stall. Given the large number of people selling these foods, she has had to summon up a lot of hard work and oil up her tongue to persuade customers to buy foods from her.

ventures: a general store and a tricycle operator business. She lives in Purok San Roque, Barangay Kawit, Medellin, Cebu.\r\n\r\nZosima has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and tricycle businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,400.\r\n\r\nZosima is now borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she can purchase more products to sell and also to use as a partial payment for a tricycle. This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganoon.

A. lives in the municipality of Santiago de Mar\u00eda in the department of Usulut\u00e1n. She is a single mother and has a daughter of 10 years. She strives every day to give her best for the benefit of her daughter. Vilma owns a tortilla business. The tortillas are made from corn. Her business is located in her house where people come and buy the tortillas. She has been for 4 years in this activity. Tortillas are a basic food in San Salvador. People eat them two or three times a day, and this makes her business stable enough. Vilma has a strong desire to expand her activity, because she will use her earnings to provide her daughter with everything she needs. Her daughter is the main reason why she wants to improve her business. This is why Vilma applies for a loan to buy more corn and thus be able to serve more customers and earn more money to pay for household expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":682271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her family is comprised of her husband, Roberto, and their 3 children, who she loves very much.  Together they live in their own house, located in Uni\u00f3n Palomar (Peruvian central forest).  As a couple, friends and associates, Orencia and her husband began a food store 30 years ago, where every morning she sells basic supplies, while her husband \"Lolo\", as she affectionately calls him, works in their agricultural fields.  Their main cultivations are comprised of coffee and avocado and what she likes most is to be able to share the family expenses between the two of them.  Thus they manage to develop together.  The plans of this couple are to be able to obtain a good coffee crop.  Because of this they are working arduously for this agricultural campaign, where they market their grains to the cooperative of Alto Palomar, obtaining profits according to the quality of the coffee.

She loves to take care of her dairy animals and has even nicknamed one of them \u201cMurgut\u201d, which makes her a very proud farmer. \r\n\r\nNow she is seeking a loan to buy a dairy cow so that she can fully utilize the space in her farm and so that she can seize the opportunity to supply the demand for milk in her village. Through increased profits, Priscilah will be able to comfortably provide for her children and will also be able to secure a future for her eventual grandchildren. \r\n\r\nShe is confident that if you invest in her, she will be able to turn around her life. With the accumulated profits, she will be able to open a large milk shop that will sell to both wholesalers and retailers in the future.

has been living in Santa Lucia for about 25 years. He has been farming rice since he was a young man since he did not finish school and only had the skills passed down by his father to rely on. With his work he has provided for five children, three of which are still in school (ages 7, 10 and 15). With the loan he hopes to make an investment in seeds and fertilizer to reap more from his lands. Jesus hopes to make some improvements in his home with the extra profits, as well as secure the education for his children. <\/p>\r\n<<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Jesus is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.
