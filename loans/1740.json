cow cage. The Group is led by the 50 year-old farmer Mahrum, who is standing in the front right, pointing his two thumbs up and wear a white religious fez at his head. The other farmers in the group are Ipin, Kamrun, Uki, Halil, Mahrip, Santun, Muh, and Azwan. Because Halil and Mahrip were unable to attend at photo-taking process, they were represented by Inak Ati (Halil's wife) and Zubaidah (Mahrip's wife). Both of these women have agreed to be displayed on Kiva. All of them live in a small village in East Lombok District, Lombok Island, Indonesia. Mahrum has a family with four children. He also is a figure of religious and member of community society in his village. \n\nMahrum has high hopes for his family and he strives to improve his economic conditions. In 2006, after he returned from Malaysia, he was concerned to see many of the poor farmers in his village. He run a small scale vegetable farming and established a farmer group. His business runs well. Two years ago, he bought some beef-cattle which he fattened for resale. However, he was troubled with the high price of chemical fertilizers. He also concerned to see the cow dung was wasted without further processing and it started to pollute the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nAfter socialized by YRE and Yayasan Mitra Membangun Masyarakat Sejahtera\/YM3S (a local foundation \u2013 biogas construction partner of Yayasan Rumah Energi) about Household Biogas (BIRU) program, Mahrum saw the biogas program is a solution of his problem. He saw opportunity to reduce his dependence on non- renewable cooking gas. In addition, he also wants to use bio-slurry (biogas residue) as organic fertilizer for his plants or sell it to increase revenue. Mahrum feel enthusiastic to purchase a bio-digester, but he does not have sufficient capital for it. A loan from Kiva will help him and other group members to make it possible.\n\nHe have an optimism that if he can build bio-digester, he can use the bio-gas for cooking, and bio-slurry (biogas residue) as fertilizer for his plantation. He also hopes that in the future, he can invite the whole farmers in his village to use biogas and also establish bio-slurry related business to create a new job opportunity to his surrounding neighborhood.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":695.84,"image":{"id":1858702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home

She is married and has seven children. Five of them are adults. Two are 16 and 8 years old and go to high school and elementary school. Her husband works in agriculture.\r\n\r\nNelly wanted to earn some money on her own and help her husband with the home expenses. She sells clothes and Avon, Yanbal, and Belcorp products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes and accessories for women). She sells door-to-door when she is free, and at home, where her most loyal customers visit her. She sells on credit and collects the money weekly.\r\n\r\nNelly will give part of this loan to her husband, who grows vegetables and raises animals.

Before joining Juhudi, Doreen could not access loans from banks since they considered her a high risk client. She mobilized marginalized farmers and created the group Zawadi (present).

Her business is selling small home appliances. \r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, generous, patient, dependable, responsible and very hard-working. She operates her business in the \"Plan 3000\" area, which is known for the origin of its inhabitants: Aymar\u00e1, Quechua and Guaran\u00ed people who settled in the southern part of the city. Migrants from all over the country have made their homes in this area and developed an active center of commerce. The area has a warm tropical climate with daytime temperatures varying between 21 and 35 degrees Centigrade.\r\n\r\nGlenda has olive skin, long red hair which she wears in a ponytail, and dark eyes. She is small in stature and has a slender build. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family. She speaks Spanish in the broader culture and in her business. She shares her life with her partner, who is employed, and with her son, who is not yet of school age. They live in a room of their own built of brick and cement, with a metal roof. They have water, sewer and electricity connections. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling small home appliances such as coffee makers, irons, toaster ovens, electric kettles, blenders, toasters, and others. She works at a permanent sales stand during the day, from Tuesday through Sunday. On Mondays, she takes a day off and organizes her house, her family and her work. \"The appliances I sell are basic ones for the kitchen, their price is affordable, and my customers are loyal,\" she comments. The advantage of her business is that small appliances are modest in price and easy to transport. The disadvantage is her lack of investment capital to stock her business. Her dream is to open an appliance store with its own building. She would like to stock her business with new, low-cost products. This is her seventh loan sequence with the institution during the six years she has dedicated to this business. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Glenda is requesting a loan to buy low-cost small appliances to stock her business and to open a store.

She is happily married and, together with her husband, blessed with an adorable family. \r\n\r\nShe is a wise farmer whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kericho, in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. \r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been growing maize, tea, kale, tomatoes and also, she keeps dairy cows. Seline has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. \r\n\r\nAlthough she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. \r\n\r\nSeline mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. \r\n\r\nSeline is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge hence suffering so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan, Seline is going to achieve her dream and goals. \r\n\r\nAccessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Seline feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Seline will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market and also, she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market, hence increased income level. \r\n\r\nSeline is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work. With your loan, Seline will improve her living conditions and assure her children of a secure future and uninterrupted learning.

This contributes 30% to her family's income of 9,000 INRS. This income covers the living costs for her family of six, which includes her four children: a toddler, two primary-school-aged children, and a teenager. \r\n\r\nKampaben diligently saves 1,500 INR  each month for her children's education fund but  she knows she must save more. \r\n\r\nHer other group members (Kantaben, Jenaben, Shantaben, and Malkiben) have similar financial situations. All of their micro-enterprises have potential for growth that could almost double their incomes. They are unwilling to borrow from a local moneylender and get exploited by high interest rates.  Kampaben convinced her group members to form a joint liability group and apply for a microloan of 75,000 INR. \r\n\r\nKampaben will buy bulk quantities of potatoes and cabbages, the preferred vegetables in her impoverished neighborhood for their low cost and longer shelf life. She will also stock up on tomatoes and chilies, which are frequently bought by her customers to make the fresh, nourishing curries that are an integral part of their meals. \r\n\r\nThis investment will increase Kampaben's income up to 5000 INR a month and double her monthly savings for her children's future.  Kampaben and her group are grateful for your timely support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":612.52,"image":{"id":1839134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy potatoes, tomatoes, cabbages, and chilies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dahod","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":428,"posted_date":"2015-04-17T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-17T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenaben","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kantaben","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kampaben","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shantaben","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malkiben","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":102.09,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6356.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665100448},{"amount":102.09,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":6356.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681398529},{"amount":102.09,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:20:33Z","rounded_local_amount":6356.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696608695},{"amount":102.09,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":6356.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711532449},{"amount":102.08,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:16:20Z","rounded_local_amount":6356.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731046993},{"amount":102.08,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":6356.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752135738}],"funded_date":"2015-04-19T15:30:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Etchison","image":null}},{"id":868707,"name":"Shingal Mahila Mandal Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mangiben (at center) is the owner of a small  shop in the rural Dahod district of Gujarat, and is the leader of this group of rural women entrepreneurs.

Her husband's income of 6,500 INR is used to cover living costs for their family of seven. This does not leave Mangiben with spare funds to increase her inventory. At the same time, she certainly needs to grow her business and income in order to ensure that her children continue their education and attend public college. She did not attend school  and wants her children to have the opportunities that a good education brings. \r\n\r\nMangiben recruited similar-minded local small business owners and formed a joint liability group.

Ggroup members Rasilaben and Lataben will expand their vegetable businesses, Kaliben will boost her accessories and costume jewelry business, and Anitaben will purchase inventory. \r\n\r\nMangiben will purchase tea, sugar, and snacks.

five vegetable vendors from rural Jhabua, in Madhya Pradesh, India. \r\n\r\nThe income from her vegetable selling micro-enterprise contributes 20% of her family's monthly household income of 9,000 INR which is just enough for a family of six,  to meet living expenses. \r\n\r\nDiligent with her finances, Kalpana somehow saves1,000 INR  each month. Her parents had been unable to send her to school, and she does not want the same fate for her children. They will soon reach the age to enroll in kindergarten, and Kalpana knows she must earn and save  in order to ensure that her children go to school. \r\n\r\nMotivated by this singular goal, she rallied her friends, Ganga, Usha, Tarej, and Khusum, who also support their children and families by selling vegetables in their respective localities. They have jointly applied for an enterprise microloan of 50,000 INR to grow their small businesses. Kalpana will invest her share of the loan to buy potatoes, onions, garlic, carrots, and cabbage. These vegetables have a longer shelf life in comparison to greens or softer vegetables. Selling to more customers and negotiating better rates on bulk purchases will help Kalpana earn an extra 2,500 INR each month, a boost that will more than double her current meager income, and more than triple her monthly savings. \r\n\r\nThe other group members stand to achieve similar significant boosts in business. Kalpana and her group are thankful for you timely loan, which will be an important source of support and a chance to better provide for their children's futures."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":412.5,"image":{"id":1838164,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy  potatoes, onions, garlic, carrots, and cabbage.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Jhabua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":428,"posted_date":"2015-04-17T13:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-17T13:50:03Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ganga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Usha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kalpana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tarej","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khusum","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4281.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665100450},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4281.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681398531},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4281.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696608697},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:39:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4281.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711532451},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:16:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4281.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731046995},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4281.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752135740}],"funded_date":"2015-04-19T10:39:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Etchison","image":null}},{"id":868717,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda is a 63-year-old married woman with four children.

Emmy is happily married, and, together with her husband, has been blessed with a lovely family. Her primary source of income is milk, but she also cultivates maize on her farm. Emmy also engages in other personal business and has been able to earn a handsome profit. She practices agriculture with a difference \u2013 employing youthful energy, enthusiasm, and knowledge from the agricultural trainings that she has attended. Emmy sells vegetables, eggs, and milk in the nearby market. She finds that milking and feeding her own cow are the most enjoyable parts about farming. Emmy is very thankful that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in her village. Profits from milk sales have enabled her to take care of her family. Emmy has always yearned to have more dairy cows. \r\n\r\nEmmy is seeking a loan to buy a good breed of dairy cow. She has already identified the breed of cow that she will buy. The cow will produce between 15-20 liters of milk per day that is known as \u201cthe ideal drinking milk\u201d because it has all the required quantities of fat and protein. Emmy\u2019s cow will certainly boost milk production on her farm which will translate into more sales and better income for her family. Because of the potential for high milk production, Emmy will be able to save money to fully repay her loan. She also believes that, through the careful selection and application of strict standards of excellence in keeping her dairy cow, she will have more income to improve her living standards.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":227.94,"image":{"id":1856004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-17T14:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-17T14:10:04Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.98,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":63100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4465.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4596.28},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4730.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4868.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5011.16},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5157.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5308.34},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5463.47},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5623.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5787.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5956.62},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6130.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.22},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.89},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.2},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.08},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":226.96,"local_amount":20547.41,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:45Z","rounded_local_amount":21107.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.98,"payment_id":696588241}],"funded_date":"2015-04-17T15:45:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":867714,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emily is a perceptive woman. She takes advantage of and develops the opportunities that arise. She has always stood out for being an independent person. Emily is happily married and, together with her husband, blessed with a lovely family. \r\n\r\nEmily Is a wise farmer whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Eldoret, in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. For the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been growing maize, vegetables, and tomatoes and also, she keeps dairy cows. Emily has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. \r\n\r\nAlthough she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\" she said. Emily mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. \r\n\r\nEmily is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge hence suffering so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetable and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price and through this loan, Emily is going to achieve her dream and goals. \r\n\r\nAccessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Emily feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Emily will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market and also, she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market and hence increase her income level. \r\n\r\nEmily is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work. With your loan, Emily will improve her living conditions and assure her children of a secure future.\r\n\r\nLenders kindly lend to this hardworking woman who hopes to improve her family's life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":498.07,"image":{"id":1855320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike to transport produce to market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-17T14:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-17T14:10:04Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.77,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5591.06},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5754.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5922.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6095.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6273.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6457.22},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6645.93},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6840.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7040.07},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7245.81},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7457.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7675.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7899.83},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8130.71},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8368.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8612.89},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8864.6},{"due_date":"2016-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":9123.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.29},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.08},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.42},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.75},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.14},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.59},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.12},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.73},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.41},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.17},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":141.66,"local_amount":12923.82,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:34:18Z","rounded_local_amount":13119.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601566},{"amount":86.09,"local_amount":7853.91,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:12:56Z","rounded_local_amount":7973.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378541},{"amount":155.23,"local_amount":14648.64,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":14870.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.34,"payment_id":711506518},{"amount":108.32,"local_amount":10012.48,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:35Z","rounded_local_amount":10164.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.43,"payment_id":731023360}],"funded_date":"2015-04-17T16:04:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":868178,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah is 29 years old and has a mixed farm in Kipsaiya, Kapsowar, Kenya, where she lives with her family.

Although she never advanced her education, she is an accomplished farmer who has experience in farming. She is happily married, and together with her handsome husband, they are blessed with three children. \r\n\r\nFor the past 18 years she has been involved in mixed farming, and because of the immense knowledge she has in farming, farmers from their village and neighboring villages troop to her home to seek technical advice on the best farming techniques. Flora also does a \"side hustle\" motorbike business. \r\n\r\nFlora has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully use this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices in the recent past have been going up. Flora, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she knows that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure, and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling her milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also be selling to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nFlora said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agriculture-based loans, and their interest rate is low and is on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro-finance institutions. Flora hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. \r\n\r\nThis loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children. Lenders, Kindly help this woman who works tirelessly to support her family.

She knocked on many doors looking for a job, just to hear \u201cno.\u201d She is a strong woman and confident in her decisions. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Nkubu in the central region of Kenya. She has been doing this for 16 years. \r\n\r\nHer primary source of income has been growing maize, vegetables, and tomatoes and raising poultry. Cicilia has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. \r\n\r\nAlthough she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. Cicilia mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo, which she will use to buy another motorbike. \r\n\r\nCicilia is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge resulting in many losses. Perishable products such as vegetables require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Cicilia feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo that help women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of this loan are enormous because Cicilia will never suffer losses due to a delay in delivery of produce to the market and also, she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market and earn an increased income. With this loan, Cicilia will improve her living conditions and assure her children a secure future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":231.41,"image":{"id":1855743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase another motorbike.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-17T14:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-17T14:30:05Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.9,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cicilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4325.82},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4452.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4582.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4716.28},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4854.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4995.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5141.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5292.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5446.92},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5606.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5769.94},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5938.57},{"due_date":"2016-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6112.1},{"due_date":"2016-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6290.75},{"due_date":"2016-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6474.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.31},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.7},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.58},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.32},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.11},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.95},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.85},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.81},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125.35,"local_amount":11508.17,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:44Z","rounded_local_amount":11657.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.52,"payment_id":696588235},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":9649.12,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":9774.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.38,"payment_id":731023363}],"funded_date":"2015-05-17T13:02:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":868033,"name":"Christina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christina, a 56-year-old farmer from Chebiemit, a remote village in the Kapsowar area of Kenya, is elegant and admirable in spirit and effort. She is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in her village because of her resilience despite personal challenges and her passion to support her children as a primary caregiver. \r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been growing maize, keeping sheep and  dairy cows. Christina has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. \r\n\r\nChristina is requesting a loan to buy an additional quality dairy cow and to build a modern dairy unit. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profits and increased income levels. The profit from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. \r\n\r\nChristina is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future, she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling it. She will also start selling dairy products. An improved income level will assure her family a secure future. \r\n\r\nBy joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets. Christina believes that if female farmers had the same access to resources as men, the number of people living in poverty would be reduced."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":239.24,"image":{"id":1855768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality dairy cow and build a modern dairy unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-17T14:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-17T14:30:05Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.91,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.35},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.73},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.68},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.92},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.62},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":137.32,"local_amount":12729.13,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:44Z","rounded_local_amount":12771.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.58,"payment_id":696588237},{"amount":100.01,"local_amount":9354.72,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":9385.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.33,"payment_id":731023364}],"funded_date":"2015-04-17T17:28:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":868724,"name":"Gemma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gemma operates a motorbike transportation business.

She is a mother with a deep passion for dairy farming. After all, that is what she has been doing for over 20 years. \r\n\r\nShe owns a small farm in Kuserwo village, which is situated in the Rift Valley province of Kenya. The income she makes from farming is not sufficient to comfortably sustain her large family. As a result, Albina has ventured into a couple of small side businesses to make extra shillings. With the aid of her handsome husband, Albina also rears sheep and grows maize, amongst other crops. \r\n\r\nAlbina is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 for constructing a cowshed. She plans to put up a well-designed barn that will provide a clean, comfortable home for her herd and a pleasant, efficient workplace for her. In a bid to increase milk production, the cowshed will provide a favorable environment for the cows. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Albina has carefully planned for the storage and handling of milk, feed, bedding and manure, as these account for most of the labor in any dairy farm.

She is a married woman, aged 36, and has three children in school. She survives by selling windscreens at a local complex well known as a good market for motorcycle spare parts. Her major objective in life is to attain financial security. At the age of 20, she established her own business with a very small amount of capital. Gradually, over the years, she has built her business up from her savings and financial discipline. She reckons that she earns more than $700 profit per month from the shop.\r\n\r\nHer husband actually struggled in the past when he was just a self-employed mechanic repairing motorcycles and vehicles and could not earn enough. Now he is working with Tabeth as a windscreen fitter, and this is attracting more customers due to their supply and repair service, not offered by many in the industry. Tabeth wants to contribute income to sustain the daily needs of her family. \r\n\r\nShe has received a loan worth $1200 that will be used to acquire large quantities of windscreens to benefit from economies of scale. She plans to hire a regular staff member that she can train as a salesperson, who will be able to assist her with everyday activities. She is hoping to save enough funds to open a shop in the central business district as well as to support the educational needs of her children. The Mushamukadzi group intends to repay the loan over a period of six months and hold each other accountable for the repayment of the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":1835463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy windscreens in bulk for her motorcycle repair shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-04-17T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-17T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":3600,"lender_count":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shupikai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649745795},{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665235555},{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:15:07Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681541949},{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:15:07Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696747207},{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711678887},{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731183013}],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T14:21:04Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T17:29:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joan Parks","image":null}},{"id":865471,"name":"Dung","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Dung operates a food stall\/restaurant selling\u00a0shrimp.\r\n\r\nDung is 24 years old, married, and has two children.

Her children help her taking care of the store as they know the prices and can handle money. \u201cI started my business out of the need that existed in the neighborhood. My children work with me looking after the customers and I provide pretty much the whole neighborhood with food\u201d she commented. Her advantage is the lack of competition in the area, her disadvantage is the long trips she takes to stock her store. <br \/><br \/>Her dream is to have a large and well-stocked store. She wants to expand her business through the purchase of food and basic use items wholesale to stock her store and pay for the expenses of her children. This is her 2nd loan with the institution in the 2 years she has had her business.

The group is made up of four women, three tailors and a tuck shop owner.\r\nJudith is the group treasurer, a fashion designer by profession trained at a reputable tertiary institution called Christian College. After completing her course, she worked at Edgars, a giant in the clothing industry, as a fashion designer. In 2012, she decided to start her own business designing and sewing African attire. She bought a heavy-duty sewing machine to increase her operations. Over those years, demand for her clothes has been increasing.

The mission of business is to work with local farms and food enterprises to develop organic food production, create market demand for chemical free products, and raise health awareness among consumers.\n\nThe first farming project Artillery undertook since 2013 is with a group of families in Kampong Thom, a farming cooperative of 4,000 farmers who raise and harvest Organic certified cashew nuts. Their local production partner, Mekong Rain, supports their organic farming practices then purchases the raw cashew kernals and processes the nuts at a facility in the village. \n\nCheck out this video which depicts Artillery supply chain to get organic cashew nuts: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZXpMETuglUE\n\nThis creates local jobs particularly for women to stay in their community and work closely to home and their families  - and at the same time those farming families can avoid the dangerous health impacts of industrial chemicals used in agriculture.\n\nThe processed nuts are sold to Artillery, which helps to create the local market demand for organic products in the restaurants and other shops.  \n\nThis loan allows us to advance money to the farming cooperative to invest in raw materials and employ the people to begin processing this season's cashew harvest.  After the harvest and processing, Artillery will use and retail the organic products in shops and markets across Cambodia. \n\nThe loan also allows us to go beyond just cashew nuts, and begin these organic farming projects in other rural communities with other locally grown crops - such as palm sugar, avocados, and wild raw honey. \n\nHow the loan will perform:\n\nThe first tranche (\u201cTranche 1\u201d) of USD 10,000 will be loaned to Artillery Cafe to purchase Cashew nuts from Mekong Rain on behalf of Artillery. The remaining USD 20,000 will be reserved for 2 tranches of USD 10,000 each to be employed in the same way for other supplies to be determined. The loan will be repaid in 3 years because Artillery needs USD 30,000 for 3 consecutive seasons as a pledge for suppliers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":30000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1858583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Growing Businesses"],"use":"To invest in raw materials and employ people to process this season's organic cashew harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Phnom Penh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.55 104.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":344,"posted_date":"2015-04-17T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-17T16:50:03Z","loan_amount":30000,"lender_count":919,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Artillery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":37,"loan_amount":30000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-29T15:49:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":869782,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"A Senhora Julia vive numa casa propria com dois filhos, \u00e9 militar.

She has a vocational education and worked for many years as a cook in Russia. In 2013 she gave birth to her youngest son, and ever since she has been taking care of the home, children and livestock. Now that her son is in kindergarten, she has more free time and decided to start her own business. She carefully analyzed the market and decided to open a shop selling carpets, rugs, pillows and linens. Gulzhan says that these kinds of goods are in demand in her village and that there will be practically no inventory left over. \r\n\r\nGulzhan currently has four cows, five sheep and five goats and will certainly continue to raise livestock. She grows feed on her own plot of land and the animals graze in the summer. Her spouse will help her with the livestock business.\r\n\r\nGulzhan's eldest daughter is a designer by profession. Gulzhan and her husband bought her a sewing machine and plan to have her sew linens for Gulzhan to sell in her new store. She will buy the rest of the goods at the region's wholesale market. \r\n\r\nGulzhan really wants to start her business soon and become more independent and self-sufficient, to support her family and not have to deny her children anything. She has already rented a storefront at the market in the center of the village for 5,000 som (KGS) per month, but she still needs the funds to obtain inventory. This is why Gulzhan applied for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) with Bai Tushum Bank to start her business. She will use the loan to buy carpets, linens, blankets and pillows. So far she has earned 19,958 som (KGS) from the livestock business and expects profits of more than 50,000 som (KGS) from the new business. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan in expanding her business and to educate and raise her children. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":571.7,"image":{"id":1854363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to start her own business selling carpets, blankets, pillows and linens in order to be more independent and pay for her children's education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl-Alma village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-04-17T18:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-17T18:50:06Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.27,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulzhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5772},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5868},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5966},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6065},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6167},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6269},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":6374},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":6480},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":6588},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":6698},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6809},{"due_date":"2016-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6923},{"due_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":7038},{"due_date":"2016-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":7156},{"due_date":"2016-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":7275},{"due_date":"2016-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":7396},{"due_date":"2016-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":7519},{"due_date":"2016-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":7637}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.03},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.26},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.05},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.61},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.44},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.3},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.19},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.1},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.05},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.39,"local_amount":5772,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:50:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5839.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664996098},{"amount":92.91,"local_amount":5868,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:53:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5936.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291513},{"amount":94.46,"local_amount":5966,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:54:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6036.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500762},{"amount":96.03,"local_amount":6065,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":6136.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711411706},{"amount":97.65,"local_amount":6167,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:00:26Z","rounded_local_amount":6239.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730933918},{"amount":96.99,"local_amount":6269,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:06:23Z","rounded_local_amount":6342.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.27,"payment_id":752025990}],"funded_date":"2015-04-21T09:28:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Hendrickson","image":null}},{"id":868413,"name":"Aminata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 51-year-old Aminata.

Su negocio lo realiza en la localidad de \u2018Cotoca\u2019 un \u00e1rea rural localizada al este de la ciudad, famosa por sus comidas tradicionales y por la fabricaci\u00f3n de jalea y melao (derivados de la ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar), tambi\u00e9n por sus tradicionales horneados de ma\u00edz y yuca, como; el sonso, roscas, arepas, cu\u00f1ap\u00e9s y bizcochos, los pobladores son herederos de una cultura artesanal; especialmente de cer\u00e1micas, de clima c\u00e1lido tropical con una temperatura que var\u00eda durante el d\u00eda entre 21-35 grados Cent\u00edgrados.\nKarina  es de tez morena, cabello negro largo lo usa amarrado, ojos obscuros, baja estatura, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica mediana, su lengua materna es el Guaran\u00ed que se habla en el lugar y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y por el negocio que realiza (de pie, la primera de la izquierda, viste solera y pantal\u00f3n negro). Su vida la comparte con su esposo que trabaja en el comercio y con sus hijos; los 2 mayores estudian en la escuela y el menor a\u00fan no se encuentra en edad escolar, viven en una casa propia construida de madera con techo de calamina, que cuenta con agua potable, electricidad y alcantarillado. La necesidad por mejorar sus ingresos la impuls\u00f3 a formar una banca de personas con negocios como; venta de ropa de cama, agricultura, venta de fruta, venta de art\u00edculos de limpieza, venta de empanadas, venta de refrescos, venta de perfumes, venta de verduras y venta de poleras, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y mejorar sus actividades.

Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 10 a\u00f1os que realiza esta actividad de forma independiente. \nEs por esos motivos que Karina solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de ropa de segunda mano para ofertar mayor variedad y pagar los gastos escolares de sus hijos.\n","en":"Karina is a 30 year old, married woman.  She has three children, ages 15, 11, and 3 and she sells second hand clothing.\r\n\r\nShe is a good, optimistic, generous, friendly, and hardworking, responsible mother who runs her business in \u2018Cotoca,\u2019 a rural area in the eastern part of the city, known for its traditional dishes and making of jelly and molasses (made from cane sugar) and for its traditional corn and yucca baked goods, such as sonso, roscas, arepas, cu\u00f1ap\u00e9s and bizcochos.  The people here have learned the artesian culture, especially in ceramics.  The climate is warm and tropical with temperatures that vary between 21-35 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nKarina has brown skin, long black hair that she ties back, dark eyes, is short in stature and of medium skin complexion.  Her native tongue is Guarani and she speaks it at home.  She speaks Spanish culturally and in her business. (She is standing to the left and wearing a black top and pants.)  She shares her life with her husband, who is a merchant, and her children.  The two oldest ones attend school and the youngest is still too young.  They live in a wooden home with a corrugated metal roof.  It has potable water, electricity, and sewage.\r\n\r\nHer need to improve her income led her to form a group with other merchants such as bed clothing sellers, farmers, fruit sellers, cleaning product sellers, empanada sellers, soft drink vendors, perfume sellers, vegetable sellers, and t-shirt sellers.  This way she can request a loan and improve her business.  She sells second hand clothing like pants, t-shirts, shirts, etc. on foot, visiting fairs businesses, and markets every day of the week in the mornings and evenings.  \u201cI sell the clothing continuously because the process are more affordable than new clothing,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nThe advantage to her business is that she sells seasonally and the disadvantage is that she doesn\u2019t have a fixed location to sell from.  Her dream is to have a clothing store.  She wants to expand her business by buying a variety of second hand clothing such as t-shirts, jackets, pants, etc. in order to improve her income and be able to pay her children\u2019s school expenses.  This is her first loan through the institution in 10 years.  She works on her own.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason that Karina is requesting this loan, so she can buy second hand clothing to offer a better variety and be able to pay her children\u2019s school expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5650,"image":{"id":1851139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-04-17T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-17T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":5650,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nimio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evangelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Jessica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mairena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-13T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":39000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":5650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-26T04:00:00Z","amount":2169.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T04:00:00Z","amount":2158.09},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T04:00:00Z","amount":2197.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T04:00:00Z","amount":2237.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T04:00:00Z","amount":2278.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T04:00:00Z","amount":2283.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T04:00:00Z","amount":2394.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T04:00:00Z","amount":2404.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T04:00:00Z","amount":2421.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T04:00:00Z","amount":2516.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T04:00:00Z","amount":2538.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T04:00:00Z","amount":2584.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":2631.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T04:00:00Z","amount":2679.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T04:00:00Z","amount":2728.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T04:00:00Z","amount":2777.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":314.27},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":318.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":324.13},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":346.89},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":348.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":364.57},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":367.73},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":374.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":381.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":388.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":395.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":402.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1599.42,"local_amount":11040.21,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":11051.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046610},{"amount":677.66,"local_amount":4677.66,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4682.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344431},{"amount":1063.72,"local_amount":7342.48,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":7349.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554644},{"amount":742.15,"local_amount":5122.8,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5127.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468733},{"amount":769.41,"local_amount":5310.98,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5316.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296578},{"amount":797.64,"local_amount":5505.87,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5511.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076787}],"funded_date":"2015-05-09T18:19:24Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Meet Beatrice, 37 years of age. She is very ambitious, enterprising, and a go-getting woman who hails from the Nyamira area of Kenya. She is a proud mother and has been doing mixed farming for the past four years. Her primary sources of income are egg selling, crop selling, and some personal business that she does to make ends meet. Beatrice loves farming. She has even nicknamed her cow and she really takes good care of her dairy cows. The Nyamira area has favorable conditions that favor horticulture farming; that is, good soil, good climate, a good transport system and a ready market for horticulture products. Beatrice wants to take advantage and start horticultural farming. She is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming. She intends to buy good vegetable and fruits seeds that she will use in horticultural farming.  With more income, she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children. The financial benefits that Beatrice will reap are almost immediate, and hence she will be assured of a secure future.

On the farm, she grows vegetables that she uses for both consumption and sale. This business has enabled her to raise one child. Carolyne's own upbringing was so difficult that she never had the privilege of attending good private schools. Carolyne is seeking a loan to venture into commercial poultry farming. With the loan, she will acquire a brood of hens that will lay eggs for food, sale and hatching. This business is projected to significantly increase her income. The birds will also bring life into her home, as they will be free-range and scratch the earth for bugs. The money from the investment will enable Carolyne to afford basic needs and save up for the future.

Meet Rael, 48 years of age, a very hardworking, progressive and honest farmer from a very remote village in Karachine in the Nkubu area of Kenya. This area is very fertile, with favorable weather patterns that support farming activities. <br \/><br \/>Rael is happily married and the proud mother of seven children, and together they live on a small piece of land that she really treasures. Her primary sources of income are eggs, milk, and a variety of food crops that she grows on her farm. She also works in transportation and does some small business transactions in order to make ends meet. <br \/><br \/>Although this humble and industrious mother makes a profit, she faces the challenge of not being able to produce enough to meet the ready market that is available. Therefore, she is seeking funds from Kiva lenders to buy farm inputs such as good fertilizer and good-quality seeds. Through this loan, she will double her production and this will translate into increased income. She then intends to save more money in the future so that she can develop her farming. <br \/><br \/>This loan will help Rael to realize her dream of getting out of poverty, and she will be able to secure her family's future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":106.61,"image":{"id":1857006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farm inputs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-18T01:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-18T01:30:06Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.31,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1397.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500.82},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1544.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1589.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1684.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1733.32},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1783.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1836.12},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1889.78},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1945.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.73},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.41},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.07},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.66},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.26},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.7,"local_amount":3172.9,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3321.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460110},{"amount":34.35,"local_amount":3053.72,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3196.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588243},{"amount":36.25,"local_amount":3249.63,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3401.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.31,"payment_id":731023369}],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T04:36:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":868905,"name":"Ana May","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana May is 42 years old, married, and has two children.

Of all the activities she involves herself in, poultry farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and feed her animals.

She would like to expand her poultry business, but the biggest challenge she faces is lack of capital. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 20,000 KES, which she will use to buy additional poultry.

If taken seriously, poultry farming has the potential of being a big business because the demand for poultry products is always high.

She works selling home appliances.\r\nShe is a good mother, kind, generous, patient, responsible and very hard working. She conducts her business in the \u201cPedro Domingo Murillo\u201d zone, a residential area where weekly fairs are held in different neighborhoods. With a cold and dry climate and a temperature that varies during the day between 0-12 grades centigrade.\r\n<p>\r\nMery is of dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair, usually tied back, short in stature and of robust physique. Her mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks around family; she speaks Spanish for general culture and for the business she manages. She shares her life with her children, who attend school, and they all live in a brick and cement room that has a tin roof, electricity, drinking water, gas and sewage. Her business is selling appliances at the various neighborhood fairs in her zone; under an umbrella, she sets up shop where one can find: blenders, juicers, thermos, irons, pots and other home appliances.\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cI started my business with a small capital for the sale of blenders and irons\u201d, she mentions. The advantage of her business is that she can sell on credit; the disadvantage is that she must travel long distances with her merchandise. \r\nHer dream is to open up an appliance store. She wishes to purchase wholesale home appliances to increase her revenue and be able to pay for her children expenses. This is the second series of loans with this institution in the two years she\u2019s been working in this business. This being the reason Mery is requesting a loan to purchase wholesale home appliances to increase her sales, open up a shop and pay for her children expenses.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":463.19,"image":{"id":1854725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"purchase wholesale home appliances to increase her sales, open up a shop and pay for her children expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-04-18T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-18T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-11T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-10T04:00:00Z","amount":59.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T04:00:00Z","amount":60.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":67.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":68.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":70.85},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":72.26},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":79.31},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T04:00:00Z","amount":81.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T04:00:00Z","amount":81.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":87.41},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":91.74},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T04:00:00Z","amount":92.8},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T04:00:00Z","amount":98.71},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":101.32},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T04:00:00Z","amount":105.4},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":109.93},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T04:00:00Z","amount":107.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.26},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.31},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.93},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.41},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.74},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.8},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.71},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.32},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.4},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.93},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120.27,"local_amount":120.27,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":120.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046612},{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":64.59,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":64.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344433},{"amount":67.11,"local_amount":67.11,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":67.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554646},{"amount":68.11,"local_amount":68.11,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":68.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468735},{"amount":70.85,"local_amount":70.85,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":70.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296580},{"amount":72.26,"local_amount":72.26,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:42Z","rounded_local_amount":72.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076789}],"funded_date":"2015-05-17T17:13:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Brown","image":1676231}},{"id":868901,"name":"Salomathon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salomathon is a hardworking woman.

Meet Charity, a very skilled farmer with experience in diverse areas of agriculture, with an innate talent for teamwork and with a great business mind. She is a wise farmer who neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. \r\n\r\nShe farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Nkubu, in the Central region of Kenya. Charity is happily married, and together with her husband, blessed with one lovely child. \r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been growing maize, milk, cabbage, and tomatoes. She also keeps dairy cows. Charity has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. \r\n\r\nAlthough she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\" she said. \r\n\r\nCharity mobilized other women in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Charity is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge; hence, she has been suffering so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan, Charity is going to achieve her dream and goals. \r\n\r\nAccessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Charity feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are enormous because Charity will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market, and also because she will increase her sales volume, as she will be able to transport more goods to the market and hence increase her income level. \r\n\r\nCharity is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work. With your loan, Charity will improve her living conditions and assure her child's future.

She hopes one day to be able to build her own house and expressed her dream to give her children access to university education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1851567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy a supply of cookies, chocolates and candies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MG","country":"Madagascar","town":"Antsirabe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-20 47","type":"point"}},"partner_id":359,"posted_date":"2015-04-18T06:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-18T06:10:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.33,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeannette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MGA","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83330},{"due_date":"2015-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83330},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83330},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83330},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83330},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83330},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83330},{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83330},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83330},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83330},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83330},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83370}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.65,"local_amount":166660,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-24T12:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":175930.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.85,"payment_id":651332488},{"amount":60.35,"local_amount":166660,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":175930.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.15,"payment_id":665242822},{"amount":67.94,"local_amount":193150,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":203893.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.49,"payment_id":681549576},{"amount":49.82,"local_amount":140420,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":148230.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.84,"payment_id":696755229},{"amount":124.91,"local_amount":333110,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":351639.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731191538}],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T07:26:11Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T17:39:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":868964,"name":"Helen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helen is a married woman with two children.

She is 46 years old now, and for seven years she has engaged in cooking and selling foods for snacks in her community in Pasay City. Blessed with three children, she works hard to provide for the daily needs of the household.  <br \/><br \/>In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.<br \/><br \/>Gelita plans to cook and sell more snack recipes, but financial insufficiency becomes a barrier. For this reason, she would like to avail herself of a loan amounting to 15,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional raw products like pork, chicken and seasonings that are needed for her business. In advance, she would like to extend her deepest thanks to those who will support her. <br \/><br \/>Gelita dreams of building and expanding her business to secure the future of her family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1857115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Today, she works as a cleaning lady and she also raises livestock and grows crops to provide another source of income for her family.  She has three cows on her farm as well as 1.2 hectares of land on which she grows beans.  Thanks to her very hard work, she makes 10,000 som (KGS) every month from her activity, which roughly covers the family's food expenses and their other day-to-day needs.  However, this amount of money is not enough for a decent life.  Eager to further develop her business, Munduzkan has therefore turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy one cow and nine sheep.  She is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further grow her business, which will help her to improve her family's well-being."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":787.5,"image":{"id":1855701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase one cow and 9 sheep in order to increase her income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bakai-Ata, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-04-18T08:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-18T08:10:03Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Munduzkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":393.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":393.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":393.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":393.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":393.75,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:53:20Z","rounded_local_amount":25160.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291515},{"amount":393.75,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":25160.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730933920}],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T14:46:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":865939,"name":"Jeanne","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mari\u00e9e et \u00e2g\u00e9e de 43 ans, Jeanne est une femme qui a trois enfants \u00e0 sa charge.

She receives a pension and also works as a school teacher, an activity which constitutes her family's main source of income.  In addition, she raises livestock and grows crops.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has seven horses on her farm, as well as one hectare of leased land and 0.6 hectares of her own land.  She makes a total monthly income of approximately 15,000 som (KGS), which is not enough for a decent life.  In order to further develop her farming activity, Zulpiyahan has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy feed and hay for her horses.  She is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further increase her number of domestic animals.  She also wants to save some money to build barns."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1855764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy feed and hay for her livestock, which will allow her to invest in her business and increase her income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ken-Jilga village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-04-18T08:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-18T08:50:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zulpiyahan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":12780.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291516},{"amount":200,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":12780,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730933921}],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T12:50:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":865892,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2015-04-18T08:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-18T08:50:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-19T17:14:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Ryder","image":1886035}},{"id":865961,"name":"D\u00e9bi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"D\u00e9bi  est une femme mari\u00e9e \u00e2g\u00e9e de 54 ans qui vit \u00e0 Adidogom\u00e9 avec ses quatre enfants.

Madhya Pradesh is one of India's underdeveloped states, and Jamuna's family is one of the many in the state that scrapes together a living on a monthly income of INR 10,500. \r\n\r\nWith three children, including two teenagers, to raise and put through school, Jamuna realizes she has to save a lot more than the meager INR 1,500 she sets aside each month, which is most of the INR 2,000 she earns by selling vegetables in her neighborhood. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of improving her income, Jamuna formed a group with Sunita, Radha, Bhagwati, and Maya, who also sell vegetables, to keep their families financially afloat. Together, they seek a loan of INR 55,000, which they will invest in boosting their inventories of vegetables and growing their respective microenterprises. \r\n\r\nWith her share of the loan, Jamuna will buy larger quantities of onions, garlic, carrots, cabbages, and potatoes, which are in great demand in her locality. Buying in bulk will help her negotiate better rates from the suppliers in the main market, and the resulting profits and increased sales will help Jamuna earn an extra INR 2,500 each month. This will more than double her monthly income and boost her savings by 67%, which is a big deal for someone of Jamuna's impoverished background. \r\n\r\nOver time, she hopes to further grow her income and savings, eventually saving enough for at least her youngest child to attend public college, and guaranteeing at least a high school education for her two older children. Having missed out on an education due to her family's poverty, the hope of putting her children through school is what drives Jamuna's ambition and goals as a microentrepreneur. \r\n\r\nJamuna and her group are thankful for this loan, which is a timely opportunity to provide better for their children and families."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1838108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To boost her vegetable selling microenterprise by stocking up on popular vegetables like onions, garlic, carrots, cabbages, and potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Jhabua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":428,"posted_date":"2015-04-18T12:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-18T12:50:05Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sunita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Radha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhagwati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4583.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4583.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4583.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4583.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4583.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4583.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4583.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4583.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4583.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4583.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4583.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4583.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":4583.33,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4670.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665100451},{"amount":75,"local_amount":4583.33,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:22:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4670.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681398532},{"amount":75,"local_amount":4583.33,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4670.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696608698},{"amount":75,"local_amount":4583.33,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:39:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4670.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711532452},{"amount":75,"local_amount":4583.33,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4670.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731046996},{"amount":75,"local_amount":4583.33,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4670.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752135741}],"funded_date":"2015-04-18T14:45:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":868994,"name":"Anita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anita has faithfully paid back her previous loan, which she used for her business.
