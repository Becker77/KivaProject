Like many smallholder farmers in Kenya, she owns a tiny inherited plot of land to live off of, just under three acres, and has always struggled to support her family. Her primary source of income has been crops and some small personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. Dorcas passionately loves dairy goat farming but one challenge she has been facing is a lack of funds to buy a goat. She is kindly seeking a loan to buy a superior breed of goat. \r\n\r\nFrom the loan, she will get a steady source of nutritious milk that she will use for home consumption and she will sell the extra milk to the neighbors. Feeding the goat will never be a challenge for Dorcas because she has planted forage on her farm and will be supplementing this by cutting plants at the river bank for fodder. This will assure her of increased milk production. \r\n\r\nA goat produces about two litres every day, and so Dorcas will use the money she used to spend on milk for essential food and pocket money for her children who are away at school.

Everline hails from the Nyamira area of Kenya, a place that has produced some top elite athletes for the world. Everline's area has good weather patterns that favor crop and dairy farming. \r\n\r\nEverline is a very hardworking woman who enjoys farming, which she has been doing on her small piece of land for the past three years. Through all those years, she has gained much experience and is one of the most respected farmers in her village. Because of the immense knowledge that she has of farming, Everline offers extension services to other farmers who are new to the business. \r\n\r\nBeing a caring and loving mother, Everline has been able to take care of her family and support them through the profits she has earned from farming. Although Everline reaps much profit from farming, one challenge that she is facing is that the village where Everline lives has only one diesel posho (cornmeal) mill that keeps on breaking down. She seeks to change this situation by buying an electric posho mill. \r\n\r\nEverline is respectfully asking for a loan to buy an electric posho mill. Through the loan she will be able to serve the other villagers by grinding their maize. Maize is a staple food in Kenya and because of this, Everline will be assured of profits and clients. Everline is sure that if you invest in her, she will be able to realize her dream of having a good quality life and securing her children's future. \r\n\r\nEverline has gone through the repayment schedule and amount and is comfortable with the plan.

He plans to send his children to school with the profits from this season\u2019s harvest.\r\n \r\nWith this loan, Isa\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 6.5 acres of land and purchase a total of six solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1807306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase seeds, fertilizer, and a solar light","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Butere","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-18T20:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-18T20:50:04Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roselyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilkista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohamed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Musa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aidah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Habil","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdallah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":110370,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110370}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-16T22:59:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Li","image":null}},{"id":869080,"name":"Ibrahim's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ibrahim, pictured above, is 53 years old, married, and has ten children.

With the loan from Kiva, she would like to buy fertilizers to grow rice. The profits from the business will be used to renovate her house and pay school fees for her children.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

The profits from the business will be used to buy a cow for rearing and to buy medical insurance.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

children attend school. Consessa is a farmer who has been growing maize for the past 21 years. Her husband is also a farmer. With the loan from Kiva, Consessa would like to buy fertilizers to grow maize. The profits from the business will be used to improve her welfare.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Most of the population speak the Mayan dialect Kakchiquel and some Spanish. <br \/><br \/>The President of the Trust Bank is 38-year-old Santos who has been a widow for 16 years and has raised three teenage children. She sent each to elementary school. As sole provider for the family, she works hard to meet their needs. She is in her fifth loan cycle. Her previous loans have greatly helped her with her jewelry business. Santos has made many beautiful beaded items that she has been able to successfully sell. Currently, along with a sister-in-law, Santos has a small restaurant that the pair began eight months ago. She is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase corn, beans, rice and other staples including firewood. Her goals are to offer a wider menu and attract more customers.<br \/><br \/>The ladies of the Trust Bank are hungry for knowledge about the world around them and within them as most have had little or no education. Each month at their meetings, they transact business on their loans and then participate in non-formal educational trainings. A recent topic was goals and dreams and the women had a lot of fun thinking of them. Other subjects include money management, business tools (accounting, budgeting, marketing), women\u2019s rights as well as health, hygiene and the use of medicinal plants. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of these educational trainings and small loans \u201cMicrocredit Plus. <br \/><br \/>Thank you, Kiva investors, for your generosity and kindness in funding loans for women like Santos. The women of the \u201cTabl\u00f3n Central\u201d Trust Bank are taking steps toward a brighter, more prosperous and happier future with their new tools.

Having the need to generate income to respond to household expenses and finding it impossible to obtain employment, seven years ago, she took on the task of starting a business selling food, such as mullet rice, pork rice, chicken rice, rice water and fresh vegetables, which she buys in different city markets and her husband transports in his vehicle to different neighborhoods.  Her market is a little more fluid than that of the neighborhoods, because Gloria's uncle is the owner of several stores and businesses, and this allows her to offer the employees of these businesses the products that she makes, which gives her a greater profit.  Her future goal is to make improvements to her home and her plan is to satisfy the demands of her customers, however, her greatest challenge is having sufficient capital to achieve this.  Currently, she is requesting a Kiva loan, first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will purchase rice, oil, meats, fish, and vegetables in greater quantities, to increase her productivity and thus earn more money, which will make her Kiva loan a successful investment."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":180.45,"image":{"id":1856304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice, oil, meats, fish, and vegetables in greater quantities.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-04-19T13:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-19T13:10:04Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.92,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66462},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":72456},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":74630},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":76868},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":79174},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":81550},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":83996},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":86516},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":89112},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":91785},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94538},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":102913}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.85},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.62},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.6},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.61},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.64},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.71},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.82},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.58,"local_amount":66462,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":66661.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666497363},{"amount":28.98,"local_amount":72456,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:55:03Z","rounded_local_amount":72673.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681350478},{"amount":27.6,"local_amount":74630,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:57:07Z","rounded_local_amount":74853.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.25,"payment_id":696560745},{"amount":28.03,"local_amount":76868,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:47:17Z","rounded_local_amount":77098.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.72,"payment_id":711475488},{"amount":30.08,"local_amount":79174,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:25:14Z","rounded_local_amount":79411.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.59,"payment_id":730994357},{"amount":29.26,"local_amount":81550,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":81794.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.36,"payment_id":752082319}],"funded_date":"2015-05-17T17:12:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathryn Luehm","image":830122}},{"id":869400,"name":"Clarita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clarita is 53 years old and has two children.

He started to learn about the craft when he worked as a foreman for a company in which he supervised several sheet metal fabrication companies. Through this job, he was required to make frequent visits to the sheet metal fabrication  warehouses and began to become interested in pursuing this field as a career. \r\n\r\nThrough his 10-year term as a foreman, he started to save enough money to follow his dreams and start a career in the sheet metal industry. Luis first started by working for a sheet metal fabrication business, doing outside sales, where he learned the actual fabrication process. His hard work led him to become the general manager for this company, and he was able to save enough money to start his own business. \r\n\r\nLuis started his business in January 2009 and has since been able to purchase all of his equipment for the manufacture of metal for wine cooling systems. One of the challenges in this industry is that since all customers are commercial, the payment for the projects does not come until 30 days after the project is complete, meaning that Luis must have the capital up front to complete the project. This has been a struggle, especially for larger projects. Therefore, Luis decided to turn to Kiva lenders for help.\r\n \r\nLuis will use his Kiva loan for working capital to help supplement his current cash flow. He has some potentially big clients and is looking to be able to service their needs, and the loan will help him accomplish this. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Luis hopes to be financially stable, continue to provide for his wife, who stays home to take care of their three children, improve his credit, and earn enough to completely stop factoring and service larger clients, thereby hiring more employees.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":509.63,"image":{"id":1857427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"for working capital to complete bigger projects.

She lives in the urban community of Antsirabe on the High Plateau of Madagascar with her husband and four children. She has been raising pigs for many years. This is a traditional family business: as a child she observed and helped her parents with it. When she grew up and was a young mother, she naturally went into this business. She has been a partner of Vahatra for some 10 years. Thanks to the profit from her business, she has already been able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nEmelie is a courageous woman who has chosen to run a complementary business, alongside her pig-raising activity, so as to support her family and continue to set aside savings.

He lives with his parents and his young daughter to whom he dedicates every minute of this spare time.\r\n\r\nLuis currently works in a call center for a systems company.

His dream is to work for a multinational company in the oil sector. He says that what makes him stand out from the crowd is his determination, as despite becoming a father at a young age he has managed to overcome every obstacle in his path. This is why he is requesting a loan to complete his studies towards a degree in public accounting, which he believes will allow him to aim for better job positions. This will in turn help him to improve his family's quality of life as the income he currently earns is only just enough to cover the household costs.\r\n\r\nLuis is moved by the fact that there are people willing to help others. It makes him happy and motivates him to finish his university studies. He believes that this type of help is a great opportunity for those people who have had to confront obstacles in their lives from an early age.

She is single with no children, and she has a business selling second-hand clothing.\r\n\r\nCandelaria is entrepreneurial, patient, persevering, responsible, and very hardworking. Her business is located in the '16 de Julio' area that is known for the origin of its inhabitants: Aymar\u00e1s y Quechuas. Situated to the north of the city, migrants from everywhere appropriated this area and created an area commerce that is continually growing. The weather here is cold and dry, with temperatures that vary between 2-14 degrees centigrade during the day. \r\n\r\nCandelaria is dark-skinned with brown eyes and long black hair down to her shoulders. She is short with a robust physical build. Her native language is \r\nAymar\u00e1, which she speaks with her family. She also speaks Spanish for general purposes and in her business. She enjoys her life with her relatives who work and are independent. They live in a home owned by the family, which is made of bricks and cement with a corrugated iron roof. The house has potable water, electricity, and a sewage system.\r\n\r\nCandelaria has a business selling second-hand clothing such as pants, polo shirts, t-shirts, shirts, blouses, jackets, coats, etc. She needs to stock her business with a greater variety and quantity of clothing to compete in the market. Also, she would like to open another store in the same area in another market. \"I started my business selling stuffed animals, but my business gradually evolved over time...\" says Candelaria. The benefit of her business is that clothing constantly sells because she has a permanent stand to sell from. The drawback is her lack of capital to be able to invest and make her business grow.\r\n\r\nCandelaria's dream is to have her own stores in 2 markets. She would like to invest in her business by purchasing second-hand clothing at wholesale. For these reasons, Candelaria is requesting a loan to buy second-hand clothing at wholesale in order to open another store that sells clothing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1857319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used
