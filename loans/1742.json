The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 liter tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nEquator College will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Denis ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases, as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":670,"image":{"id":1857890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

a\u00f1os, y su negocio es la venta de refrescos. \nElla es buena madre, amable, solidaria, responsable y trabajadora. Su negocio lo desarrolla en el \u2018plan 3000\u2019 barrio Aymar\u00e1, Quechua y Guaran\u00ed, ubicado al sur de la ciudad, migrantes del todo el pa\u00eds se reunieron y formaron un gran comercio, de clima c\u00e1lido tropical con una temperatura que var\u00eda durante el d\u00eda entre 18-36 grados cent\u00edgrados. \nSonia es de tez morena, cabello negro largo lo usa amarrado, ojos obscuros, baja estatura, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica robusta, Su lengua materna es el Guaran\u00ed que habla en familia y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y por el comercio que realiza (la primera de la izquierda, viste polera roja y calza negra). Su vida la comparte con su esposo que se dedica al comercio y con sus hijos; los 2 mayores trabajan y estudian y el menor a\u00fan no se encuentra en edad escolar. Viven en un cuaro alquilado construido de ladrillo y cemento con techo de calamina que cuenta con agua potable, energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y alcantarillado. Sus deseos de superaci\u00f3n la llevaron a formar una banca de personas con negocios como; elaboraci\u00f3n de empanadas, venta de material escolar, venta de prendas de polic\u00eda, servicio de limpieza, venta de cereales, venta de polainas, venta de pa\u00f1ales y venta de candelabros, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y ampliar sus actividades. Su negocio es la venta ambulante de refrescos hervidos, como; Mocochinchi (preparado con duraznos secos hervidos), Chicha (preparada en base a ma\u00edz), Som\u00f3 (similar a la Chicha pero incluye el hervido del ma\u00edz) y otros, que son refrescos tradicionales y muy populares. \u201cinici\u00e9 mi negocio porque conoc\u00eda la demanda de refrescos fr\u00edos en la zona y porque conoc\u00eda su consumo popular\u2026\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que los clientes son constantes y las ventas continuas, la desventaja es la distancia que debe recorrer cargando bidones de refresco y bolsas de hielo. Su sue\u00f1o es abrir un puesto de venta fijo de refresco, ella desea ampliar su negocio mediante la compra de ollas para hervir refresco y vender mayor cantidad. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 10 a\u00f1os que se dedica a esta actividad. \nEs por esos motivos que Sonia solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de ollas e utensilios de cocina para la elaboraci\u00f3n de refrescos tradicionales para abrir un puesto fijo de venta.\n","en":"Sonia is a 37 year old woman. She is married and has 3 children, aged 21, 19 and 3. Her business is selling beverages. She is a good mother who is kind, supportive, responsible and hardworking. She runs her business in the \u2018Plan 3000\u2019 neighborhood, where Aymar\u00e1, Quechua and Guaran\u00ed migrants from all over the country got together and made a great commerce center. It has a warm, tropical climate with a temperature that varies between 18-36 degrees celsius.  \r\n \r\nSonia has dark skin, long, black hair she ties back, dark eyes, short stature, and a robust build. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks in her family, and she speaks Spanish in the general culture and in her business. She is the first on from the left, wearing a red t-shirt and black shoes. She shares her life with her husband, who works as a business, and with her children. The 2 oldest work and go to school and the youngest is not school aged yet. They live in a rented room made of brick and cement with a sheet metal roof. It has potable water, electricity and plumbing. Her desire to get ahead led to her forming a bank of people with businesses such as making empanadas, selling school materials, selling police clothing, a cleaning service, selling grains, selling gaiters, selling diapers, and selling candelabras. They did it to ask for a loan an expand their activities. Her business is selling boiled beverages as a street vendor, such as mocochinchi (made with boiled dried peaches), chicha (made with a corn base), som\u00f3 (similar to chicha, but it includes boiled corn), and more. These are traditional drinks and they are very popular. \u201cI started my business because I knew about the demand for cold drinks in the area and because I knew about popular consumption\u2026\u201d she remarks. The advantage of her business is that her customers are loyal and her sales are stable. The disadvantage is the distance she has to go, hauling containers of beverages and bags of ice. Her dream is to open a permanent beverage spot. She wants to expand her business by buying pots to boil beverages and to sell a larger quantity. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 10 years that she has been doing this activity.  \r\n\r\nThat is why Sonia decided to ask for a loan to buy pot and kitchen utensils to make traditional beverages to open a permanent sales spot. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":1857398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy pots and kitchen utensils to make traditional beverages to open a permanent sales stall.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will, therefore, save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

With her portion of this loan, she will be able to buy materials to build a hygienic septic tank latrine and a hand-washing device with soap. Those facilities will help her family improve their health and living conditions, while affording safety for them. In addition, this will provide convenience, cleanliness and privacy for all family members, while contributing to the environmental protection of the community. In the picture, Thoi is pictured in a white shirt, first from the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1854972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to pay for the construction of a hygienic toilet and a hand washing device with soap.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Vietnam","town":"Hai Duong","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":331,"posted_date":"2015-04-19T22:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-19T22:10:06Z","loan_amount":4650,"lender_count":146,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Th\u1eddi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Quy\u00ean","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Duy\u00ean","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Th\u00f9y","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"T\u00e2n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tu\u00e2n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"T\u00e2n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"H\u00e0","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u00c1nh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chi\u1ebfn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":100000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":4650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000000},{"due_date":"2017-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2325},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-04-23T04:01:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":869725,"name":"Progressive School","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Uganda! This is Peter. He is the head teacher of the Progressive Secondary School, a mixed school in the urban area of Kitintale in Kampala with 700 students. Progressive Secondary School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and, therefore, has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nProgressive Secondary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Peter ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1005,"image":{"id":1858006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

","en":"Mulosharif is 40 years old, married, and the happy father of four children.  After finishing school, he decided to look for a job, so that he could help his parents and feed his sisters.  For three years he worked in construction; he was planning to make some money and apply to university, but this didn't happen. He got married when he was 25 years old and started his own business.  He raised livestock and also grew fruits and vegetables on his own plot of land, then resold his produce at the market.  Today, Mulosharif has two cows and five sheep and he takes very good care of them.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Mulosharif is planning to buy one cow and one sheep in order to expand his livestock headcount.  He also wants to buy oats for his animals, but he doesn't have the full amount of money necessary.  For this reason, he has turned to MDO Arvand for a second loan.  He is hoping for a long cooperation (with the microfinance institution), and he thanks you for your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1855714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to increase his livestock headcount.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Mastchoh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-04-19T23:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-19T23:50:05Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mulosharif","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1055.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1088.01},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1148.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1180.61},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1225.62},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1301.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.63},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.83},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.17},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.73},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-18T19:46:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":869760,"name":"Tasleem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tasleem is 33 years old and married.

He and his wife are raising three children.  He has a secondary education.  Although it is very difficult to find a job in the village, Almaz still has to support his family and educate his children.  For this reason, he has been involved in agriculture for 11 years already.  He owns two horses which he uses to provide shepherding services to the local residents.  He makes a monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS).  In order to further grow his farming business, he has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) to buy a few cows for fattening.  Almaz plans to use the earnings from his loan to further increase his number of domestic animals.  He also wants to save enough money to build barns for his livestock."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":519.7,"image":{"id":1857172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nGoodwill Baptist Primary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

She has a specialist secondary education and works as an inspector and archivist. She also works in animal husbandry and agriculture as an additional source of income for her family, a business she began in 1995. Thanks to her hard work, she currently has one cow and 30 sheep as well as 2.5 hectares of her own land where she grows beans.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Kulsunai has approached Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 KGS to purchase a dairy cow to increase the volume of organic milk she can sell. She is a member of the Bai Tushum group along with four other people. She plans to put profits from the loan into further developing her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":262.77,"image":{"id":1856329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Mbuya Parents School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. \r\n\r\nInstalling a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nMbuya Parents School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Roger ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school.

As her children grew older, Jro Nyoman found that their increased needs required her to earn additional money to supplement the income provided by her husband. She therefore decided to start raising pigs in her yard. \r\n\r\nTo start her new business, Jro Nyoman joined the other members of the Sari Kencana group in requesting a loan through MUK via Kiva lenders. The members bought piglets with their loan funds, and these investments brought them profits and new business capital to reinvest into their businesses.\r\n\r\nJro Nyoman is now requesting a new loan in the amount of 1,000,000 IDR, which she will use to buy two piglets at 500,000 IDR each.

Her main customers are residents of her neighbourhood, who boost sales and with whom she has established great business relationships. \r\n\r\nHer goal in the future is to study and therefore move her and her family forward, although her biggest challenge is getting her products to reach a greater number of people.

Four years ago, he began a sewing business in the company of his mother, although his experience dates from 10 years before, when he learned this work in a family member's workshop. In Danis's shop, he does all sorts of sewing to make dresses in the women's and children's lines, primarily, although he also makes Bermuda shorts for men to sell them in the stores located outside the city, where his principal market is.  His current goal is to increase his production and in the future manage to make technical improvements to his workshop and, with it, generate more earnings to purchase his own house.
