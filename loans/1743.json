They all go to school. She is a farmer and she has been growing maize for the past five years. Her husband also is a farmer. With the loan from Kiva, she would like to pay workers to harvest maize. The profits from the business will be used to buy a house.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

This loan of 400,000 AMD will help him to buy a water tank and to construct a pipeline along his land."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475.4,"image":{"id":1858652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to buy a water tank and to construct a pipeline along his land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Syunik region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2015-04-20T19:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-20T19:50:04Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narek ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30480},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30990},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31310},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":32010},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":32080},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33200},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33610},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33970},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":34800},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":35230},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":35830},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":36490}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.02},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.55},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.42},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.86},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.14},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":412.62,"local_amount":194175.6,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:53:14Z","rounded_local_amount":195607.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649701144},{"amount":5.57,"local_amount":2622.2,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2641.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665190137},{"amount":13.94,"local_amount":6559.1,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T16:11:46Z","rounded_local_amount":6607.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681496651},{"amount":5.88,"local_amount":2769,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:13:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2789.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696703262},{"amount":3.18,"local_amount":1496.8,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T17:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1507.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711635288},{"amount":4.13,"local_amount":1943,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:30:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1957.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731140430},{"amount":30.08,"local_amount":14157.6,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":14262.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752227336}],"funded_date":"2015-04-22T00:29:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharine Wu","image":1259244}},{"id":870175,"name":"Zareena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zareena is 49 years old.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to buy a cow.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Patrick\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 6.75 acres of land and purchase a total of 10 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1807997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Butere","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-20T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-20T20:10:06Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magaldalenah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dickson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haggai","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mwanaidi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sheban","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caleb","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cammy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":121150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-18T16:57:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":870173,"name":"Hadijah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hadijah is a fourth-time borrower of the institution applying for UGX 2,500,000.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.

With the little time Jane has, she sells crops from her small farm and also keeps dairy cows and poultry. \n\nFrom Kiva lenders, Jane is seeking a loan of 60,000 KES to grow her horticulture business.Jane practices horticulture farming and she grows vegetables and fruits and wants to increase her horticulture production. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to give Jane access to a loan facility that will aid her to grow her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. \n\nWith your loan, Jane\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":301.75,"image":{"id":1855292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to grow her horticulture business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-20T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-20T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.52,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.35},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.73},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.62},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.68},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.92},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.62},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":4246.37,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4295.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460102},{"amount":49.11,"local_amount":4533.67,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:12:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4585.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378540},{"amount":49.32,"local_amount":4553,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4605.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588231},{"amount":102.77,"local_amount":9534.85,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:35Z","rounded_local_amount":9644.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.52,"payment_id":731023358},{"amount":54.03,"local_amount":4987.16,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5044.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111502}],"funded_date":"2015-05-08T20:42:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Revie","image":692978}},{"id":870205,"name":"Vardan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vardan lives with his parents and disabled brother in the village of Ddmashen in Gegharkunik region.

She is described as a dynamic woman, full of energy to work and offer her children a better future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2946.68,"image":{"id":1857601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Call Center","sector":"Services","themes":["Vulnerable Groups","Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy and sell pre-paid reloadable phone cards.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"San Lorenzo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":188,"posted_date":"2015-04-20T21:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-20T21:50:05Z","loan_amount":6000,"lender_count":192,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwar Gercy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petita Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geoconda Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doris Gina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blucher Benito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tedi ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":6000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":384.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":459.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":469.16},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":481.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":483.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":505.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":508.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":517.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":532.82},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":540.85},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":551.93},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":563.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":384.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":459.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":469.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":481.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":505.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":508.9},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":517.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":532.82},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":540.85},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":551.93},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":563.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":425.81,"local_amount":425.81,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":425.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665248526},{"amount":471.08,"local_amount":471.08,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:14:27Z","rounded_local_amount":471.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681555214},{"amount":492.35,"local_amount":492.35,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-26T12:11:25Z","rounded_local_amount":492.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696760733},{"amount":514.69,"local_amount":514.69,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-01T12:15:42Z","rounded_local_amount":514.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711693734},{"amount":516.09,"local_amount":516.09,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-27T12:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":516.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731196816},{"amount":526.66,"local_amount":526.66,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":526.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752284377}],"funded_date":"2015-05-19T12:38:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":870247,"name":"Rise & Shine Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These three members led by Abigail as the representative are part of the group called Rise & Shine.

Jacob also decided to purchase a solar light as part of his loan, which he is very excited about, as it will allow him to have light during dark hours for his children to study by.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Jacob's Group will be able to receive a total of six solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of six acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1803220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Butere","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-20T22:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-20T22:10:09Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rajabu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beldina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jescah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mbone Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Livingstone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":92060,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92060}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-18T15:54:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":870271,"name":"Rael's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rael, pictured above, has been a farmer for 12 years, and is now proud to represent her group of 14 farmers in Butere District.

Nine ladies who live here have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cEl Rosario\u201d. The members of the Trust Bank speak the Mayan language K\u2019iche as well as some Spanish. <br \/><br \/>Filiberta is the 46-year-old president of the Trust Bank. She is married with three grown children, each of whom has graduated from school. She joined the Trust Bank eight years ago, and although she has not attended school herself, she has a good head on her shoulders and much life experience. <br \/><br \/>Filiberta, along with her husband and youngest child, work in the family bakery that they began nineteen years ago. On a daily basis, Filiberta sells her baked goods in three of the neighboring towns, the closest being Santa Clara La Laguna. The other two towns, San Pablo and San Marcos, are on the shores of Lake Atitlan, and it takes Filiberta quite a long time to take the bus down the steep mountain hillside in the very early hours of the morning. She is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase flour, sugar, eggs, and other supplies for the bakery business.<br \/><br \/>The women in Friendship Bridge Trust Banks like \u201cEl Rosario\u201d are very aware of the value of education, both for their children and for themselves. Each month at their meetings, they participate in educational trainings on a variety of relevant subjects like effective business practices (budgeting, pricing, marketing, customer service, accounting), hygiene and health, nutrition and the use of medicinal plants, as well as self-esteem and empowerment, goals and dreams, and women\u2019s rights. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of microloans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. It is most effective.<br \/><br \/>Kiva investors are greatly valued, along with Friendship Bridge, by these women. Armed with their new tools, they are poised to step into a brighter future, benefitting themselves, their families and their community of Santa Maria Visitacion."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3123.82,"image":{"id":1858932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase flour, sugar, eggs, and other supplies for her bakery business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Maria Visitacion, Solol\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-04-20T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-20T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":5350,"lender_count":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petrona Sebastiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filiberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Griselda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enma Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":40900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":5350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-27T06:00:00Z","amount":3411.6},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T06:00:00Z","amount":3411.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T06:00:00Z","amount":3411.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T06:00:00Z","amount":3411.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T06:00:00Z","amount":3411.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T06:00:00Z","amount":3411.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T06:00:00Z","amount":3411.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T06:00:00Z","amount":3411.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T06:00:00Z","amount":3411.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T06:00:00Z","amount":3411.6},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T06:00:00Z","amount":3411.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T06:00:00Z","amount":3372.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.26},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.26},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.26},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":446.26},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":446.26},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":446.26},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":446.26},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.26},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":441.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":446.26,"local_amount":3411.6,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3420.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649567077},{"amount":446.26,"local_amount":3411.6,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3420.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665049238},{"amount":446.26,"local_amount":3411.6,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3420.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347097},{"amount":446.26,"local_amount":3411.6,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3420.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696557454},{"amount":446.26,"local_amount":3411.6,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3420.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711472414},{"amount":446.26,"local_amount":3411.6,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3420.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730991501},{"amount":446.26,"local_amount":3411.6,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3420.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752079769}],"funded_date":"2015-04-23T01:31:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":865366,"name":"San  Roque Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cSAN ROQUE\u201d;

In this sector, they grow bananas for export and a variety of tropical fruit.  This little town is located on a very important road which goes to the coastal beaches of the county.\r\nFor two years, Kely has been making a living selling cosmetics.  She had to figure out a way to keep moving forward and give an education to her little ones, since due to family abuse she had to separate from the father of the girls.  Despite going through difficulties, she always has a smile on her face.  She has worked very hard.  These days, she rents a humble house where she says she wants to take advantage of the space in front.  Kely has a dream which is to be able to start a fruit and juice sales business. Given that it is a sector with a warm climate and visited by tourists, she wants to draw on these advantages to put together her own business and in this way improve things for her little ones and continue giving them an education.\r\nWith the loan offered by the Foundation, Kely will be able to set up a small place and buy tables, chairs, blenders, and fruit.  She is sure that it will go well.

She has a secondary education and receives a pension.  As an additional source of income for her family, she raises livestock and grows crops, two activities which she started more than 40 years ago.  Thanks to her perseverance, dedication and hard work, she currently owns one horse and 15 sheep.  She also owns 2.15 hectares of land and rents another hectare on which she cultivates clover, safflower and barley for domestic consumption on the farm and for resale.

As a way of generating income, she has been engaged in a variety store business within her community in Manila, Philippines for six years now. Together with her husband, Jun, a driver, they are able to sustain their family\u2019s needs. \r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nHowever, due to financial insufficiency, Nena wants to make her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like to request a loan amounting to 10,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) for additional principal that she would use to buy more grocery items that are needed. She is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nNena\u2019s dream is very simple.  She only hopes for her family to always be in good condition and health. And this will only be made possible if her business is maintained. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1858441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more grocery items that are needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-04-21T05:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-21T05:30:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2004.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536502},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2673.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017716},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2673.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314132},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2672.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522829}],"funded_date":"2015-04-21T09:12:39Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":870443,"name":"Sulia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sulia is a 25 year old single woman with no child.

He is 42 years old, and has two children who are currently in school. With her wife, Marina, they oversee the operation of their Jeepney unit, and his income from the business is helping supply their everyday needs and meet their expenses.\r\n\r\nHe has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) Jeepney, from which he is paid boundary* (daily quota) each day. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 7,000 in five days. \r\n\r\nJeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.\r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the Jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\nTirso is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan to buy spare parts and pay for the maintenance of his Jeepney unit.

As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,500 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nMerlyn is taking PHP 50,000 in loan assistance to buy supplies and other materials needed in her business. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more raw materials like fabric, thread and other items which are necessary to increase her inventory.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she dreams of expanding her business to the fullest extent. At the same time, she also wants to see her family in good health and in good condition. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week. There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
