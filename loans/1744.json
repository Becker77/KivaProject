He lives in Batasan, Quezon City, Philippines, and is married to Rosalie and has four children. As a way of generating income, he has been engaged in a buy-and-sell business within his community for three years now. Together with his wife, he works hard to provide for the everyday needs of their family.\r\n\r\nHis business basically sells rice cakes, which are common delicacies in the Filipino diet. And since rice cakes are priced inexpensively, ordinary people commonly buy them in relief of their hunger. Furthermore, it is also an advantage to Mercenario that his stall is located just along the way where people tend to pass by. Therefore, Mercenario gets a good profit from this inventory. He also sells other merchandise and various items like groceries, soft drinks and bottled water.\r\n\r\nHowever, due to financial insufficiency, Mercenario  wants to make his business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, he would like to avail himself of a loan amounting to 20,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional supplies of products that are needed in his business. He is hoping that he will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nMercenario hopes for his business to prosper and for his family to be always in good condition and getting more strength and guidance from the Lord.

Kakchiquel-speaking Maya village of Tzununa, located on the shores of the beautiful Lake Atitlan. The ladies of Tzununa have successfully finished their first loan cycle with Kiva investors. The loans were of great benefit for their small businesses. \r\n \r\nLuc\u00eda is the 28-year-old President of Tzununa. She is responsible for making certain that all the meetings run smoothly and loans are paid on time. Luc\u00eda sells snacks in her store and is requesting a loan to purchase more inventory.  She also wants to expand and sell turkeys that are very marketable in the nearby city of Solola. She is requesting a new loan for both businesses and is hopeful that Kiva investors will learn of her businesses.\r\n\r\nLuc\u00eda is a very feisty woman who believes that even without a formal education, she can improve the quality of her life. That is why she enjoys the monthly trainings that the Friendship Bridge Trust Officer provides.

With the profits from this coming season, Wilfred is planning to buy a cow.\r\n\r\nA total of six acres will be planted by Wilfred's Group, and between them, they will receive a total of nine solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1805318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, as well as a solar light.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Butere","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-21T22:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-21T22:30:08Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilfred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilbeforce","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yusuf","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibrahim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sungura","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Winfred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hannington","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":111150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-19T02:22:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":870726,"name":"Nyakisi Tweimukye Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph, a member of Nyakisi Tweyimukye group, is a married man man living in Kyenjojo-Uganda.

It is here that eight members of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank, Mujeres La Uni\u00f3n, meet monthly.  The group is asking Kiva investors for their very first loan.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is 62-year-old Juana who for many years has had a business selling typical Guatemalan clothing called traje. The outfits consist of huipiles (blouses) and cortes (skirts).  Juana is asking for a loan to increase her inventory of merchandise, especially a variety of new cortes, more huipiles, and fajas (belts).  She also wants to buy a variety of accessories that her clients are requesting. \r\n\r\nJuana is extremely pleased to be receiving a Kiva loan because, with the funds, she is able to increase her income.  And, through the Friendship Bridge Microcredit Plus program, that combines loans and education, she is a better business-woman.

El pr\u00e9stamo que solicita es para la compra  de mercader\u00eda para incrementar su nivel de ventas e ingresos y as\u00ed poder encontrarse con mejores oportunidades. La Sra. Virginia se destaca en ventas y ha mostrado ganas de superarse; es digno de destacar su empe\u00f1o y sacrificio en las actividades que realiza, caminando distancias largas y movi\u00e9ndose de un lugar a otro sin importar la distancia.","en":"Virginia is married. She lives in a modest house with her two children and her father, who is an older man, a senior. Currently, she is studying and working in order to pay for her expenses. She works selling public transportation buses (minibuses) as well as selling beauty products. In the first case she earns the minimum national wage (the lowest minimum wage required in Bolivia). Also, her husband was very sick, so Virginia had to take care of him for a long time. Fortunately, her husband is already recuperating and is working as a worker in constructions around the city of La Paz. She is requesting the loan in order to buy merchandise to increase her level of sales and income, and in this way find herself with better opportunities. Virginia is good in selling and has shown desire to progress. It is important to highlight her hard work and sacrifice in the activities she does, walking long distances and moving from one place to the other without minding the distances.

Their use is common amongst women who dress traditionally. The fabric\u2019s material can be a sign of status. \r\n\r\nShe has her own manufacturing workshop in a room in her house. She also has assistants who help her produce greater quantities. \u201cI began my business weaving with my sister. Later both of us became independent and opened our own workshops\u2026\u201d she says.  \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she works from home and this helps her be able to look after her kids without having transportation costs. The disadvantage is that fashion changes with the seasons. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to increase her production to sell to more clients. She hopes to expand her business by buying a weaving machine to manufacture and sell more. \r\n\r\nThis is her second sequence of loans with the institution in 2 years that she will use for this activity.  \r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Zonia asks for this loan to buy a weaving machine to manufacture and sell more to cover the costs of her children.

This effort proved to fullfill her family\u2019s needs. \r\n\r\nNow, Ni Wayan and other members of the Sumber Usaha group decided to have a new loan to continue the business. Their main goal is to have enough capital by saving, stop getting loans and continue the business with their own money. The needs of today's life are very expensive, and it forces everyone to work hard to make ends meet. Ni Wayan cannot just rely on the income of her husband, she also has to work. Raising pigs is one solution. She got a loan which she used to renovate the cages and she used the rest for feed. Her husband helped her to raise pigs. He feeds and cleans the cage every day. By having a clean, large cage and food hygiene, Ni Wayan hopes the pigs will be healthy and thrive.

She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price and then she will sell it per piece for a higher price to have profit.\r\n\r\nShe desires to manage a bigger store someday so she is requesting a PHP 18,000 loan, which she will use to buy additional groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She is positive that she will become a successful businesswoman in the future and she looks forward to seeing her children finish their studies through all her hard work and perseverance.\r\n\r\nSherilyn meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She develops her business in the 'Plan 3000' zone which is characterized by the origins of its inhabitants, who are immigrants; Aymar\u00e1s, Quechuas and Guaran\u00edes, located in the south of the city, where they settled and formed high-value trade. It is a warm tropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade. \r\n\r\nMicaela has a dark complexion, brown eyes, medium height, white hair she wears long, robust physical composition. Her mother tongue is guaran\u00ed which is spoken in the family and she speaks Spanish in the general public and in the business that she does. She shares her life with her relatives who are older in age. They live in their own house constructed from brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof that has potable water, electricity, and plumbing.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling empanadas and drinks by foot. Empanadas are food fried in oil filled with beef or chicken meat with egg and potatoes. Usually they are consumed before midday. Her form of work is independent, so she has to carry and sell herself and without the help of anyone, \"My business is very well-known, in the morning most of those who work in the area come by to satiate their hunger...\" she comments.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that it has been in that place for a long time and the customers are continuous.

She is married and has four children. Leslie Ann is managing a direct selling business, selling assorted products of different brands for men, women and children like soap, lotion, perfume, clothes, shoes, sandals, cosmetics and other items. She has had this business for seven years. She finds it interesting because she can earn income in an easy way through her good salesmanship and characteristic effort.

She does her business as a street vendor in different fairs and markets in the \"Sur\" zone of the city, a residential and marginal area, with rustic and old houses, many of them without access to water, which, together, make a place of manufacturing in all areas. It has a subtropical climate, with a temperature that varies during the day between 21 and 34 degrees centigrade. \r\n \r\nAdela has brown skin, dark eyes, brown hair she keeps short, is of medium stature, an average physique, her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks with her family and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for the business she does (she is seated in the chairs and is wearing a blue blouse and skirt). The need to expand her business to generate more income brought her to lead a bank of people with businesses such as a video store, silverware sales, cell phone sales, chicken sales, flower sales, tea service, and a sewing shop, to ask for a loan and improve their work. Her business is the sales of cosmetics as a street vendor, such as lipstick, eyeshadow, moisturizing creams, perfumes, etc. Her day begins by filling up a large bag, stocked with products, and she walks around fairs and markets looking for customers, who she finds working in the commercial spaces, offices, stores, etc. Her day begins in the early hours of the morning and ends at night. \"I began my business with a small investment and now I dream of opening a cosmetics store...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she knows the regular customers and has established routes. The disadvantage is the competition with better prices. Her dream is to open a store where she can show and sell her cosmetics. She wants to purchase perfumes and cosmetics in bulk, to strengthen her customer base and have a broad stock. This is her third loan cycle with the institution in the 10 years she has been doing this work. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Adela asks for a loan to purchase cosmetics and perfumes in bulk to open a store.

Su negocio es la producci\u00f3n de estuco que consiste en extraer la roca encontrada en estado natural, convirti\u00e9ndola en una pasta flexible para ser mezclada con agua y aplicada sobre superficies como; muros, cielos rasos y cementos, con la que se pueden hacer rellenos y revestimiento de acabados de la construcci\u00f3n. \u201cinici\u00e9 mi actividad hace 6 a\u00f1os como ayudante, hace 5 a\u00f1os que trabajo junto a mi esposa independientemente, contamos con un ayudante para extraer la roca\u2026\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que es un trabajo continuo que deja ganancias constantes, la desventaja de su negocio es la carencia de agua y para recogerla debe transportarse hasta el riachuelo. Su sue\u00f1o es vender estuco por mayor y comprar un cami\u00f3n para transportarlo, el desea realizar la compra de le\u00f1a y combustible para la explotaci\u00f3n de estuco. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 6 a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Freddy solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de le\u00f1a y combustible para la producci\u00f3n de estuco para vender por mayor.\n","en":"Freddy is a 34 year old man. He lives with his partner. He has two sons, 2 and 8 years old, and 2 daughters, 5 years and 2 months old. His business is to produce stucco. He is a good father, patient, understanding, optimistic, responsible and hardworking. He has his business in the town of \u2018Vichaya', 86 kilometers from the city, known for having important funeral structures called \u2018Chullpares\u2019 and defense places from the times of the \u201cSe\u00f1or\u00edos Aymaras\u201d 1100 - 1400 a.C. These \"chullpas\" can be seen from the road. It is cold and dry here, with temperatures varying from 5-16 degrees Celsius during the day. Freddy is dark skinned, with black short hair, brown eyes, short and thin. His native language is Aymara, which is spoken in the area. He speaks Spanish as general culture and because of his work. He shares his life with his wife, who works in the same business, and with his children. The two oldest go to school, and the 2 youngest are not yet in school age. They live in their own house, built with adobe with corrugated iron roof, electricity and well water extracted through an electric pump. There is no sewerage in the place. His business is to produce stucco: extracting stone found in natural state and converting it into a flexible paste to be mixed with water and applied over surfaces such as walls, ceilings and cement, used to fill gaps and finish up construction projects. \"I started my work 6 years ago as a helper. For five years I have been working with my wife independently. We have a helper to extract the stone\", Freddy comments. The advantage of his business is that it is continuous work that brings constant earnings; the disadvantage is the lack of water, and to get it one has to go to the creek. His dream is to sell stucco wholesale and to buy a truck to transport it. He wants to buy log and fuel to mine stucco. This is his first loan cycle with the institution in the six years he has been working in this activity. These are the reasons why Freddy is requesting a loan in order to buy log and fuel to product stucco to sell wholesale.

More specifically, his farm is situated in Moiben, where dairy farming is the most common economic activity. Crop farming is generally done for subsistence, which leads to shortages of vegetables in the market. Willy is seeking a loan to venture into crop farming. He has adequate land space to start this business. The fact he is seeking a loan means he is going to treat crop farming not merely for subsistence but as a commercial activity.

Actividad que realiza de forma ambulante, transportando toda su comida en ollas cargadas en un carrito de 2 ruedas y que empuja hasta encontrar un lugar donde instalarse. \u201cmi labor diaria es sacrificada, ahora quiero abrir un puesto de venta fijo\u2026\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que sabe cocinar muy bien y los clientes la prefieren, la desventaja son las distancias que debe recorrer hasta encontrar un puesto de venta. Su sue\u00f1o es abrir un puesto de venta fijo para dejar de ambular, ella desea construir un techo para su puesto de venta fijo para la venta de comida. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 3 a\u00f1os que desarrolla esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Marina solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la construcci\u00f3n de un techo para abrir un puesto de venta fijo de comida tradicional.\n","en":"Marina is a 42 year old woman who lives with her husband. She has 6 children of 5, 8, 10, 17, 20, and 24 years of age. Her business is in the sale of traditional food. She is a good mother, understanding, a good listener, optimistic, has a good attitude, and is responsible and hardworking. She developed her business in itinerant form in the zone \"plan 3000\", a citadel that was born from a flood in the eighties and that left three thousand families without a place to live. It became the new beginning of life for thousands of people, and thousands of dreams started again and began as they began to construct the citadel. \r\n\r\nMarina is of dark complexion, brown eyes, short stature, long black hair that is tied, and a robust physique. Her maternal language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish in general culture and for the business that she does (the second from the left, wearing a beige blouse and black pants). She shares her life with her husband who works in construction and with her children. The two oldest study and work, and the next three study in school and the youngest is not yet of school age. They live in their own home made of brick and cement with a tin roof that has potable water, electric energy and sewage. The necessity to expand her business to generate better economic income led her to lead a bank of people with businesses such as: sale of china, sale of chicken, selling flower, tea service, sewing, video store and selling cell phones, to request for a loan and improve their activities.\r\n\r\nHer business is in the sale of traditional food, such as: majadito de charque (majadito jerky: dried meat, rice, fried egg and fried plantain), locro carretero cruce\u00f1o (Santa Cruz road locro: soup: jerky, cut pieces of meat, cassava and egg), Sopa de Remojado (soaked soup: soup of bones), Chicharr\u00f3n de Taitetu (crackling of taitetu: fried chanchitos bush \"taitet\u00fa\"), Cogote relleno (filler neck: creole chicken neck, stuffing can be potato and churiqui), and others. She does this activity in rounds, transporting all of her food in pots on a cart with two wheels which she pushes to find a place to settle. \"My daily work is sacrificed, so I want to open a permanent stall...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she knows how to cook very well and her clients prefer it, and the disadvantage is distances she must cross to find a stall where she can sell. Her dream is to open a permanent stall and she wants to build a roof for her permanent stall so she can sell food. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in the 3 years she has been doing this activity.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Marina requests a loan for the construction of a roof to open a permanent stall for the sale of traditional food."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":1859556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is married with six children aged between 7 and 18 years. They all go to school. She is a farmer and she has been growing maize for the past eight years. Her husband is also a farmer. With the loan from Kiva, she would like to buy more fertilizers for maize. The profits from the business will be used to buy a goat.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He is married with four children aged between one and eight years. Two of them go to school. He and his wife are farmers, and he has been growing maize for the past five years. With the loan from Kiva, he would like to buy more fertilizers for growing maize. The profits from the business will be used to pay school fees for his children.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She is 60 years of age and is blessed with four children. Her husband, William, helps her in their business, and they work hand-in-hand to provide for their needs.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Perlita earns by purchasing merchandise at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Perlita wants to make her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like to avail herself of a loan of 10,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional grocery items that are needed. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nPerlita aspires to save enough money so she can afford to give her children a better life. She meets up with her fellowship group* every week to share stories of her life and business and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1860064,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy additional grocery items that are needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-04-22T19:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-22T19:50:05Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Perlita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1478.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536533},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:55:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2957.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017750},{"amount":50.01,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2218.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314166},{"amount":83.31,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3696.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522863},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":739.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433198}],"funded_date":"2015-04-22T21:01:47Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:34:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":871160,"name":"Faustin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faustin is 34 years old.
