She is married and lives in the small district of Yavan.  Her husband works as a mechanic.  Malika has six children.  Her two sons work odd jobs but mostly work as laborers on construction sites.  Her four daughters are in secondary school.  Malika knows how hard her husband and sons work in order to support the family.  Eager to help, Malika is involved in animal husbandry.

He is married and he has four children. As soon as he heard about the possibility of receiving financial support from MDO Arvand in order to grow his business, he immediately contacted them. Rajabali and his family live in a rural area. He doesn't have a higher education because his parents' difficult financial situation never allowed him to go to university. His wife is in the same situation; she didn't get an education either and she works as a homemaker, taking care of the household and bringing up the children.\r\n\r\nRajabali makes a living running his own business, fattening and selling cattle.

focused on his activities. He lives with his wife, and earns a living selling sausages (as seen in the picture). He learned this job through observation, and it arose from a need to earn an income to cover the home expenses.\r\n\r\nThis business was somewhat improvised, but little by little it grew stronger. With little, he has achieved a lot. He has a griddle and a propane tank, and he goes out every day to sell sausages. Currently, William has the inconvenience that he cannot sell many sausages because they go bad and need to be refrigerated. If he had a refrigerator, he would be able to move a greater quantity of sausages and he could sell a lot more.\r\n\r\nThinking about this necessity which would signify an important advance in his

40-year old woman who is married and a mother of four children.  At age 18, Gulnora married.  She worked out of home as a seamstress, and soon began to help her husband manage his livestock business.  They currently have a plot of land with two cows and five rams.  Gulnora milks the cows and sells their milk at a marketplace.  She also makes dairy products.  \r\n\r\nGulnora has a big family, so she and he husband work tirelessly to provide a decent life for their children.

Her business is selling secondhand clothes.She is a good mother, an entrepreneur, patient, consistent, responsible and hardworking. Her business is in the town of Cotoca, a rural area located east of the city. It is known for its regional food and ceramics crafts. It has warm and humid tropical climate with the temperature ranging between 21-35 degrees Celsius during a day.\r\n\r\nKarina has dark complexion, brown eyes and long brown hair tied in ponytail. She is short and medium built. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family, and speaks Spanish in general and for business development (the right-most wearing shirt with flowers and black shorts). She enjoys her life with her partner, who is a plumber, and her youngest son who studies in school (the other children are independent). They live in their own residence built of brick and cement with tin roof. It has water, electricity and sewerage. The need to improve her business led her to lead a personal banking with business such as craft stores, cosmetics, chicken, phone accessories, baked goods, preparation of sheets, and sausages, for a loan to improve their work.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling secondhand clothes such as pants, sweatshirts, t-shirts, shirts, blouses, sweaters, jackets, etc. Her main need is to stock greater variety and quantity of clothing to compete in the market. She also wants to open another shop at a nearby fair. \"People\u2019s needs make my sales constant and rotate merchandise continually...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that the clothes are affordably priced. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to invest in merchandise to grow her business. Her dream is to have several shops selling secondhand clothes. She wants to invest in her business by buying wholesale secondhand clothes to open a new shop. This is the 4th loan with the institution in three years making a living with this business.\r\n\r\nKarina requests a loan to purchase wholesale secondhand clothing to open a new shop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":1859617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase wholesale secondhand clothing to open a new shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-04-23T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-23T04:50:01Z","loan_amount":3350,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana Rosita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-20T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-02T04:00:00Z","amount":1759.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T04:00:00Z","amount":1761.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T04:00:00Z","amount":1793.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T04:00:00Z","amount":1826.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T04:00:00Z","amount":1859.76},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T04:00:00Z","amount":1893.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T04:00:00Z","amount":1928.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T04:00:00Z","amount":1963.16},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T04:00:00Z","amount":1998.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T04:00:00Z","amount":2027.19},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T04:00:00Z","amount":2077.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T04:00:00Z","amount":2109.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":261.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285.94},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.14},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1311.1,"local_amount":9001.6,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":9056.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046637},{"amount":556.64,"local_amount":3821.65,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3845.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344457},{"amount":1482.26,"local_amount":10176.75,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":10238.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554670}],"funded_date":"2015-05-01T02:46:47Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kiyoko Ikeuchi","image":null}},{"id":871534,"name":"Vilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vilma continuously provides for her family through her farming activities.

Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamo con la instituci\u00f3n en 13 a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta actividad de manera continua. \nEs por esos motivos que Veronica solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de material de confecci\u00f3n para confeccionar gorros de ni\u00f1os y realizar ventas por mayor.\n","en":"Veronica is 29 years old.  She lives with her partner and her two children, ages 4 and 13.  Her business is making and selling knitted goods.  She is a good mother and independent, active, consistent, enterprising, responsible and hard working.  She works at the \"16 de julio\" market and in the \"Ceja\" area known for its informal commerce and production where small business owners of all sectors display their products to the public.  It is a cold, dry climate with an average day-time temperature of between 2 and 14 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nVeronica has a dark complexion, brown eyes, is short in stature, and wears her long black hair tied back.  Her mother tongue is Aymara which she speaks with the family but she speaks Spanish for general purposes and through her trade.  She lives with her partner who is a merchant and her children.  The edlest is in school and the youngest is too young to go to school.  They live in a house belonging to her father-in-law, built of brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof.  The home has running water, electricity and a sewage system.  \r\n\r\nHer business is knitting wool hats for children.  She buys all kinds of yarn, in different colors, etc., to make different styles and sizes.  She has a workshop set up at home and then she and her partner go out to conduct sales at different markets in the commercial areas of the city.  \"The constant cold weather makes the business popular among everyone with children...\" she says.  The advantage of the business is that the products are in high demand and sell easily.  The disadvantage is that she does not have a fixed sales point.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to sell wholesale, so she wants to buy a greater quantity of materials such as yarn, fabric, buttons, thread, etc. to have a supply on hand.  This is her first loan in the 13 years she has been in business.  Veronica is requesting the loan to buy materials to make children's hat and sell them wholesale."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1859642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials to make children's hats to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-04-23T07:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-23T07:10:04Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-20T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-04T04:00:00Z","amount":320.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T04:00:00Z","amount":446.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T04:00:00Z","amount":458.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T04:00:00Z","amount":467.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T04:00:00Z","amount":498.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T04:00:00Z","amount":519.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T04:00:00Z","amount":535.03},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T04:00:00Z","amount":566.73},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T04:00:00Z","amount":583.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T04:00:00Z","amount":604.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.41},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.32},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.58},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.41,"local_amount":320.05,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":320.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046638},{"amount":64.75,"local_amount":446.53,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":447.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344458},{"amount":66.71,"local_amount":460.08,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":460.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554671},{"amount":547.13,"local_amount":3773.34,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3779.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468758}],"funded_date":"2015-04-23T12:41:57Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":870141,"name":"Ablan","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Ablan \u00e2g\u00e9e de 33ans est m\u00e8re de famille.

She is intelligent, innovative, creative, tenacious, responsible and hard-working. She develops her business in the \"Kupini\" area, located on the eastern slope of the city. It is an area affected by water leaks that cause constant landslides, causing major damage. The climate is cold and dry with a temperature that varies during the day between 4-16 degrees Celsius. \r\n\r\nCarla is dark-skinned, with brown eyes, fashionable long black hair, short stature, and thin physique.

They live in their own home made of brick and cement with a tin roof, running water, electricity and sewage. \r\n\r\nHer business is making and selling \"cholita\" shoes. The \"cholita\" is a woman in traditional dress, wearing a hat, shawl and skirt. Part of her clothing are her shoes. These are flat and constantly change design. The preparation consists of bonding the materials such as: insoles, inside of the shoe, sole, heels, etc., to achieve making a shoe, a job that is done with the help of a seamstress that is responsible for bonding the parts and giving shape to the shoe. \r\n\r\n\"I inherited this business from my parents who collaborated with me in the business. I have the goal of building a company...\" she comments. The advantage of her business is that due to the experience of her family members, she relies on a broad directory of steady customers. The disadvantage is the competition with lower prices. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to open a shoe industry. She hopes to expand her business through buying a sewing machine for sewing leather. This is the 3rd loan sequence with the institution in 3 years dedicated independently to this business.

She is married and has a son. Gulnara has a secondary education. She is very responsible, neat and hard-working. She works as an orderly in the laboratory department of a clinic. In search of additional income for her family, in 1995 Gulnara began engaging in agriculture. Today her farmstead has two horses. She grows beans for sale on her 1.60 hectares of land. The profit from the business allows Gulnara to raise livestock and prepare feed for them for the winter. In order to further develop her farmstead, she has turned to the Bai Tushum Bank for a loan in the sum of 60,000 Som (KGS) to purchase one heifer to increase her head of livestock. Gulnara plans to invest the income from the loan in the expansion of her farmstead."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":313.57,"image":{"id":1859866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy one heifer in order to increase her herd.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bakai-Ata, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-04-23T15:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-23T15:50:04Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.24,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2640},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2659},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2737},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2816},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2899},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2983},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3070},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3160},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3252},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3347},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3444},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3545},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3648},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3754},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3864},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3977},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4093},{"due_date":"2016-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4112}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.9},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.03},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.49},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.53},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.13},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.76},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.44},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.18},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.97},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.8},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.9,"local_amount":5299,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5346.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664996118},{"amount":43.34,"local_amount":2737,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:53:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2761.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291537},{"amount":44.59,"local_amount":2816,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2841.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500784},{"amount":45.9,"local_amount":2899,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:06:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2924.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711411728},{"amount":47.23,"local_amount":2983,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:00:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3009.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730933947},{"amount":47.37,"local_amount":3070,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3097.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.24,"payment_id":752026009}],"funded_date":"2015-05-23T05:03:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":871703,"name":"Eliza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"From Dipolog, Zamboanga del Sur, Eliza is 31 years old, married to a farmer and has four school-aged children.

She is a woman of 45 years and decisive character, who begins work very early each day. She began seven years ago, selling meat. With the first loan she was given, she set up a gas agency, and she invested in products like soap, detergent, oil, sugar, and other items, and so formed her general store. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her spouse, her son, and the great support of Kiva together with [partner] MiCr\u00e9dito, her business has exceeded all the goals she set, for which she thanks all of them. At this time Isayana wants to expand more, and this is why she has requested a loan from Kiva and MiCr\u00e9dito which will allow her to buy more meat and staple items such as rice, beans, sugar, and corn. In the future, Isayana sees herself having a bulk goods store in the future. Improving her quality of life and that of her loved ones is what spurs her on day by day to work for her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":510.76,"image":{"id":1859833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more meat, rice, beans, sugar, and corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2015-04-23T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-23T16:10:05Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isayana Del Carmen \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":88.9,"local_amount":88.9,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:11:28Z","rounded_local_amount":88.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665097407},{"amount":85.01,"local_amount":85.01,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:20:05Z","rounded_local_amount":85.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681395669},{"amount":177.01,"local_amount":177.01,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":177.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696605960},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731044358},{"amount":76.51,"local_amount":76.51,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":76.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752133312}],"funded_date":"2015-05-23T12:06:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Meravi","image":1279777}},{"id":870968,"name":"Ku\u00f1a Pora Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo llamado Ku\u00f1a Pora es un grupo nuevo, formado en la ciudad de Villa Elisa, son 20 mujeres, todas ellas amigas y vecinas de esa ciudad, son mujeres muy sacrificadas y luchadoras que quieren poder ayudar a sus familias.\nLa Sra.

The community is of Mazahua origin and the majority of people are also artisans, although luckily the members of the group have managed to make their work known in other states in the country.\r\n\r\nAlma Rosy, 30, is married to Gabino. They are the parents of two daughters, who are still not in school. Alma is a happy, friendly mother. Contact with people and her participation in fairs in other cities have helped her to develop even more. From a young age, she was immersed in the world of artisan silver, thanks to her mother who taught her to make earrings, necklaces, rings, keychains, chokers and many other pieces.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Alma's husband is also working in the same activity. His pieces are displayed in various galleries. For them, it is not only a way to earn an income, but also an opportunity to spread their culture to other places by creating pieces which embody traditional Mazahuan figures and patterns.\r\n\r\nThe work of the family is very well-known and has the support of private institutions as well as the commercialization services of VisionFund Mexico to go to galleries, expositions and fairs. However, her challenge continues to be a lack of capital to buy tools and large quantities of silver plates, which is how she will invest this loan.\r\n\r\nAlma's dreams, apart from increasing her sales, are to open another workshop, teach more people this activity which fills her with pride, and open her own gallery to display her exclusive designs.\r\n\r\n*The photo was taken in the family workshop.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"My two brothers and I learned to weave on a traditional loom. I was ten when I began to weave with my father and, when I was 14, I became independent. We had little looms made to our size, where we wove narrow textiles. Today, I weave rugs of wool and cotton, colored with natural and chemical dyes. I have my own workshop at home and we all weave on hand looms powered by foot pedals. I enjoy designing and weaving new rug styles, a tradition in my town handed down for generations.\r\n\r\n\"Dear friends, this microcredit is truly a huge help.

In Indonesia, one cannot water from the tap, and most do not even have a tap, for that reason many Indonesians depend on purchasing or boiling water. Mrs Sri heard of a new alternative for sterilizing water when the marketing crew from Nazava water filters held a safe water instruction session in her locality. Nazava Water Filters purify well, rain and city water so it becomes safe to drink without boiling, without using fuel or electricity.

Angeling works as a seamstress, sewing clothing according to the company's or client\u2019s dictates. She uses a sewing machine and other stitching machines as well as hand-stitching hems and linings.\n\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Angeling without access to savings or credit, is meeting family expenses. Workers can become heavily indebted to money lenders who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. \n\nFor this reason, Angeling is asking for your assistance to help her avoid using loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem in repaying them since the loan payments were automatically deducted from her paycheque. She is seeking a 8,000 PHP loan to pay for the tuition fees of her children of which two are already in college and one is in high school.\n\nAngeling hopes to give her family a good life in the future. She looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. \n\nCCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force and equip them with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating saving consciousness, and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.\n\nCCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers such as Angeling before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and after-work hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1840479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay for the tuition fees of her children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-04-23T18:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-23T18:30:06Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angeling","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3357,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536318},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2238,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017533},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2238,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681313950},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1119,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522668}],"funded_date":"2015-04-23T19:11:20Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":858762,"name":"Delia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Delia works hard to support her family.
