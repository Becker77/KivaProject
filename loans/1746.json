As their balance grows, it allows customers to make major asset purchases like housewares, appliances, and school supplies for their children.  \n\nAs a Mapan agent, Bahreni is responsible for processing deposits from customers into their Mapan accounts as well as receiving orders from customers who want to buy products listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer orders, Bahreni will submit the order via SMS and, within 5-10 days, the product will be delivered to the customer. With Mapan, Bahreni believes that his community will be able to have access to higher quality products with better prices. \n\nAs the business grows, Bahreni hopes to get working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to help community members save up for big purchases through Mapan. As seen in the photo, Bahreni is the one who is standing and holding Mapan\u2019s poster. He is thankful for your kind support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1841765,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to increase the working capital deposit needed to help community members save up for big purchases through Ruma's layaway product called Mapan.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Cilegon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-04-23T18:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-23T18:50:10Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bahreni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":7000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":7000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-17T18:53:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":870561,"name":"Maharoumba","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Maharoumba vit \u00e0 Adidogom\u00e9 et est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 54 ans.

He is sure that with proper maintenance he will achieve a better harvest and increased income for his family.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe encourage you to support this family and help strengthen the family financial situation.\u201d \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1860253,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies that will ensure the proper care for his coffee trees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":295,"posted_date":"2015-04-23T19:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-23T19:10:11Z","loan_amount":3725,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel Santos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3714,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3714}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":871769,"name":"Opetela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Opetela is a 53-year-old mother with four children.

She is 47 years old and  is married to Maximo, who is her business partner, and they help each other to provide for their family's needs. Lucy manages a buy-and-sell business of ready-to-wear items, and her income from the business helps with their everyday needs and expenses.\n\nWhat Lucy basically does is buy general merchandise items from wholesalers and then sells them piecemeal with a little profit. Products can range from ready-to-wear clothing and eye-wear to footwear and other similar products. Customers are attracted to the low selling prices and the many options that are offered. Lucy's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,500 PHP in sales every day.\n\nLucy is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan to buy more ready-to-wear items and merchandise to sell. She will use her loan to increase her sales and her additional revenue to improve her family's general living conditions.\n\nIn the future, Lucy hopes to have her own stall for her business. She also desires that her children will be able to complete their studies and that she can continue to improve her family's general living conditions. She meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God that she studies.\n\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1846108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is  in the agricultural business with her son, daughter-in-law and grandchild.  They live in the village of Akhuryan. \r\n\r\nHer first loan  helped her to overcome some difficulties with her farm and she bought potatoes and made a good profit. She  grows and sells wheat.\r\n\r\nEmma decided to increase potato production. She requests a second loan from Kiva and hopes that this new loan will have the same success as the previous one.

Ayub lives there with his wife and his five children. He owns a stall that sells small snacks, drinks and mobile airtime credits. He decided to join Ruma because he wants to learn about how to expand his business in another sector, which is technology. His community sees him as a trusted mobile provider.\r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Ayub needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits for his community, so his community can easily connect with their loved ones, no matter how far they are apart. Ayub\u2019s goal with Ruma in the near future is to serve an e-commerce business for his community, with Ruma\u2019s latest product called Mapan.

","en":"Marlon is 34 years old. He's a man who makes a living selling a variety of merchandise such as: school supplies, food and a a range of feminine and household accessories. \n\nHe has many years of experience in the trade due to it being a family tradition which has been passed down from generation to generation from his grandmother to his mother to himself and his siblings. In 1995 he decided to make his own income by selling clothes and underwear and little by little he has added other products to his inventory. \n\nHis goal is to continue improving his family's wellbeing and to make an income which allows him to expand his business. At the moment he is applying to CREDIKIVA for the first loan that the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation are offering. He will use the loan to buy school supplies, beverages, and feminine accesories to improve his response times and credibility and generate a better guarantee of service and performance. By doing this he will make the investment from CREDIKIVA successful.

The annual income after deducting all costs is just enough to cover the family\u2019s living expense and keep a little amount as a saving.

Recently, people are in the habit of using chemical fertilizer for planting trees, so the land is becoming infertile leading to the low productivity. So, this year, she and her husband have decided to change and buy organic fertilizer for the trees, although the cost is doubly expensive as compared to chemical fertilizer. The saved amount is not enough to buy fertilizer for sugar cane and rice. Therefore, she wants to borrow a loan to buy organic fertilizer for these kinds of trees. \r\n\t\r\nShe will work hard to get money to repay the loan for M7-MFI on time, and she hopes that change of

She has a business making cakes, pastries, and empanadas.  She is a good mother, is friendly, happy, enterprising, responsible and very hard-working.  \n\nHer business is located in the \"vino tinto\" (red wine) region where the people are factory workers who settled there to be close to the factories where they work.

Her native language is Aymar\u00e1 which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish for general use and in her business.  She shares her life with her baby who is already walking.  They live in a room in her parents home made of bricks and cement, with a corrugated iron roof.  The house has running water, electricity, and a sewer connection.\n\nHer business is a bakery, and she specializes in making cakes, pastries, and empanadas.  She performs this work every day of the week during the very early hours of the morning.  She later sells them in the afternoon.  She comments: \"I began my work 10 years ago, making pastries and distributing them to the nearby businesses, now I have my own store where I sell delicious pastries\".

and married.  She and her husband are raising three children.  Nargiza has a secondary education.  She works in a privately-owned greenhouse, and this activity constitutes her family's main source of income.  For many years she has also been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture.  Thanks to a positive attitude in life, to her perseverance, commitment and hard work, she currently has one cow and she grows rice for resale on 0.34 hectares of land.  Nargiza has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 25,000 som (KGS) to prepare her land for the spring and to grow organic rice.  In the future, Nargiza wants to increase her business, which will allow her to save enough money to build her own greenhouse.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":216.44,"image":{"id":1856283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She has been raising livestock for four years already, and this activity constitutes her family's main source of income.  Last autumn, because of an increase in the price of hay and livestock feed, she sold two cows and used the money from this sale to open a shop.  She now has one cow and she makes an income of 8,000 som (KGS).  Durdona has decided to start re-developing her animal husbandry activity and, for this reason, she is taking a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy some sheep.  She is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further increase her livestock headcount and to save some money to renovate her house.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":432.42,"image":{"id":1856292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She has a secondary education and has been raising livestock and growing crops for the past five years.  At the moment, she makes a monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS).

Because of her immense farming knowledge, she has turned her farmland into a learning centre. Here, hundreds turn up to get trained in the hope that they will replicate her model on their own farmland. \r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge she faces is satisfying the demand for milk in her village. The demand is overwhelming. She is seeking a loan to buy another dairy cow. She believes that through the loan, she will be able to improve her living conditions and be able to secure the future of her children. \r\n\r\nHaving gone through training with Juhudi Kilimo, she is confident that the skills she acquired will help her increase her business, and she will be able to pay back the loan.

A few days ago he shifted his workshop to another place, and due to the move, some important and expensive tools have been misplaced.\r\n\r\nSabiran requested a loan for her son so that he would be able to compensate this loss. He will buy repair tools, spare parts, tyres, brake shoes, etc. for his motorbike  repair workshop. \r\n\r\nSabiran wants to provide better education and living standards to her children. She is hopeful that her son will utilize this amount in positive way and his monthly income will increase. She thanks Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

She also does hand stitching of edges and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Marites, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nMarites is requesting a loan to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying since the loan payment is deducted every pay day.  She will also use the loan to redeem her ATM card that was pawned.\r\n\r\nMarites hopes to provide her children with a quality education. She aims to improve their living condition. She meets with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring, and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering the lives of both volunteer leaders and line

She is single and has no children. She has a business selling chicharr\u00f3n (pork cracklings). \r\nShe is empathetic, a good listener, courteous, responsible and very hard working. Her business is in Tutimayu in the northeastern part of the city. There are hotels, restaurants, internet cafes and general stores in the area. There are also nearby opportunities for extreme sport such as rafting and paragliding. The area has a rainy and warm climate with temperatures ranging between 18 and 35 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nEvangelina is dark-skinned with long braided black hair. She has brown eyes and is short and slim. She wears traditional clothes: a hat, \u201cpollera\u201d [traditional skirt] and shawl. Her native tongue is Quechua which she speaks at home, and she also speaks Spanish in the general culture and in her business. \r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her aged mother, who can barely walk. They live in their own home. It is made of adobe and has a tin roof. The home has well water and electricity.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling pork chicharr\u00f3n (cracklings), a food that is typical and very characteristic of this region. She says that she cooks chicharr\u00f3n with the freshest meat and condiments.\r\n\r\nThe home in which she lives is in a rural area and does not have basic services. They used to bring water from a stream using buckets. They later dug a well and get their water from it. Water services have now arrived in their area and are in the process of providing connections to access potable water. Her business has the advantage of dedicated customers, but the disadvantage of lack of access to basic services.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have potable water in her home. She would like to have water service to her kitchen, bathroom and laundry room so that her mother will not have to drink the dirty well water. This is her first loan cycle with this institution in the ten years that she has been in this business independently.\r\n\r\nThe reason that Evangelina is seeking a loan to get a water connection to

She uses a sewing machine and other stitching machines as well as handstitching hems and linings.<br \/><br \/>One of the main dilemmas of employees like Emerita is meeting family expenses without access to savings or credit. Workers can become heavily indebted to moneylenders who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. <br \/><br \/>For this reason, Emerita is asking for your assistance to help her circumvent loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem in repaying them, since the loan payments were automatically deducted from her paycheck. She is seeking a 10,000 PHP loan to pay for her pawned ATM card.<br \/><br \/>Emerita hopes to give her children good educations. She just wishes to meet their daily needs. She looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. <br \/><br \/>CCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness, and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.<br \/><br \/>CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers such as Emerita before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring, and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and after-work hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1861543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to redeem the ATM card that she pawned.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-04-24T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-24T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emerita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.68,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1844.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536558},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:55:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1844.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017778},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1844.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314194},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1844.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522891},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1844.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433238},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":1666.7,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1844.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954329}],"funded_date":"2015-04-27T17:53:05Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":870785,"name":"Martha Alicia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha, de 59 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta sexto grado, es madre soltera y tiene 6 hijos, quienes le apoya en el trabajo del hogar.\n\nMartha, se dedica a la venta de comida desde hace varios a\u00f1os, tolo lo aprendio con sus padres, ella se levanta a las 5:00 a.m. junto a sus hijos para preparar lo que vender\u00e1n en el almuerzo.- Ahora Martha, quiere iniciar con un nuevo negocio, de crianza y comercio de pollos de engorde, porque es un negocio muy rentable.\n\nMartha, necesita el cr\u00e9dito para comprar pollos y comprar gallinas ponedoras, para iniciar la venta de huevos.\n\nMartha, sue\u00f1a ampliar su negocio y que la venta de huevos sea rentable.\n","en":"Martha is 59 years old and attended school until the sixth grade.

She resides in Nandi Hills, Kenya. She has been practicing farming for 12 years on her small plot, where she does mixed farming. Rosah enjoys farming very much, and every day she wakes up to go to the farm and improve her life. Through farming, she has been able to take care of her large family and provide them with their basic needs. \r\n\r\nRosah has a vision of owning a large cereal selling shop.
