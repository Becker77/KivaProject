The women have been living in the same village for several decades and maintain good solidarity amongst themselves. They are active in small-scale commerce. \r\n\r\nMs. Ramatoulaye, aged 40 and sitting at the far right with a hand raised, is the featured borrower of the group.

She is active in livestock farming. \r\n\r\nWith her new loan, she intends to purchase 2 head of cattle at 85,000 francs each and 10 kg of feed at 10,000 francs and to resell them after a while. Her profits will enable her to purchase some goats, help out her husband in covering day-to-day expenses, and also help her children (medical care, schooling costs, clothing). \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":1858229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase 2 head of cattle at 85,000 francs each and 10 kg of feed at 10,000 francs and to resell them when ready","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2015-04-24T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-24T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramatoulaye ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maoudo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Seydina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haby ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama Oumar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissatou Hama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ansata Mamodou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatoulaye ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ansata Mamadou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna Boubacar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bambe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marietou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Oumar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ansatou Mamadou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binta Boubacar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tidiane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ansata Serigne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dienabou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assanaou Barro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Siradio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadidiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hadji ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1625000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1625000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2650,"local_amount":1625000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1628151.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044271}],"funded_date":"2015-04-26T19:12:06Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:10:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":872043,"name":"Leah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leah is 37 years old, married and has two children who are both in school.\r\n\r\nLeah works hard to provide for her family.

Ellima is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. Her farm has enough room for more cows, but she is taking it one step at a time. The additional cow on the farm will help utilize the available space and pasture. There are other merits to this expansion such as increased production of milk and reduced chances of shortages in case one animal cannot be milked for a particular reason. Ellima is going to use the profits from this investment to pay for her children's education.

She is employed in a garment factory in Cavite through the auspices of the Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative (CCT). Merlinda works as a seamstress, sewing clothing according to the company's or client\u2019s needs. She uses a sewing machine and stitching machines, and she also hand stitches hems and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas for employees like Merlinda is meeting family expenses without access to savings or credit. Workers can become heavily indebted to money lenders who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason Merlinda is asking for your assistance to help her circumvent loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem in repaying them since the loan payments were automatically deducted from her paycheck. She is seeking a 16,000 PHP loan to redeem the ATM card that she pawned.\r\n\r\nMerlinda hopes to give her children a better future, and she dreams of their lives prospering. She looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. \r\n\r\nCCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness, and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\nCCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers such as Merlinda before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and after-work hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1861565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to redeem her pawned ATM card.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-04-24T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-24T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2666.66,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2763.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536559},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2666.66,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:55:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2763.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017779},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2666.66,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2763.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314195},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2666.66,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2763.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522892},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2666.66,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2763.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433240},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2666.7,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2763.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954330}],"funded_date":"2015-04-25T12:11:29Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nathan Tichenor","image":28733}},{"id":872069,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca is 65 years old, and she is married with nine children.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

Over the past 8 years, she has bred more than 2 dairy cows, developed her farm, and planted and sold a variety of crops. She says the secret to her success is thinking of farming as a way to earn money, not just as a traditional way of life. Adopting new technologies and methods, crop diversification, record-keeping, and good planning also help. \r\n\r\nWiliter was unable to study for a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming since. She says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming; it runs in my blood.\u201d Because of how much she likes farming she has even nicknamed one of her cows which makes her a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. Through her dairy cow, she is able to produce between 10-15 liters a day, and this helps her support her family. \r\n\r\nWiliter also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements, and that is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, she will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer, and pesticides which she will use to greatly improve her crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques; using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. \r\n\r\nWiliter is visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production and have a crop output larger than the previous year. All this can be achieved through lenders\u2019 help and goodwill. She believes that through her loan, she will turn around her family life and be able to give her children a solid educational background. This loan will be Wiliter's way out of

Meet Margaret from Kisii in Kenya, a woman from a community not known for farming but who is earning a living through agriculture. She is happily married and together with her husband is blessed with five lovely children. For the past 20 years, she has been practicing mixed farming. Because of the experience she has, she commands a lot of respect from her fellow farmers and she is regarded as a mentor. The income from selling milk, eggs and maize have allowed her to earn a decent income. To earn extra income, Margaret engages in a small personal business. <br \/><br \/>Margaret passionately loves dairy farming and the animals on her farm have been given the names \u201cMaridadi and Nyangera.\u201d Milking and feeding her cows makes her very proud. Through milk selling, she has had quite good returns and the demand for milk has been expanding. Demand has been overwhelming and she needs an extra breed of cow to satisfy fully the demand. She is requesting a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. <br \/><br \/>Margaret does not intend to buy just an ordinary cow but she wants to buy a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce rich creamy milk. The dairy cow will be producing between 15-20 litres of milk a day. The increased milk production will translate to more income and Margaret will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her school going children. <br \/><br \/>When anybody listens to Margaret speak, one would be forgiven for thinking that she is an expert in dairy farming but because of her passion and determination she intends to beat all odds. This loan will permanently change Margaret's living standards and there is no doubt that you can find rewarding employment in dairy farming."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":358.45,"image":{"id":1861662,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-24T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-24T19:30:04Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":62400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4416.23},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4545.29},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4678.13},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4814.85},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4955.56},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5100.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5249.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5402.86},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5560.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5723.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5890.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6062.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.66,"local_amount":10414.45,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":10518.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460142},{"amount":114.64,"local_amount":10598.29,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":10704.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588280},{"amount":55.02,"local_amount":5112.46,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5163.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"payment_id":731023396},{"amount":75.85,"local_amount":7011.59,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":7081.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111525}],"funded_date":"2015-04-28T13:06:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":872113,"name":"Mwanzo Women Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The person raising her hand is Eunice, a member of Mwanzo Women Group.

On the farm, she grows various crops and keeps dairy cattle and poultry.\r\n\r\nFor the last six years, she has made money selling her farm's produce and engaging in other side businesses. She feels passionate about farming. However, her business is facing challenges such as the high cost of inputs and occasional drought.\r\n\r\nMiriam is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. The upside, to Miriam, of focusing more on her poultry business, is that it is less affected by the major challenges that face her other farm activities. Poultry feed is readily available.

Meet Caroline, a youthful 28-year-old mother, and a wise farmer who neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kapsowar, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Caroline is happily married, and together with her husband is blessed with a lovely family. \r\n\r\nFor the past five years, she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been growing maize, milk, cabbages, tomatoes and also she keeps dairy cows. Caroline has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Caroline mobilized other women in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Caroline is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge, hence suffering so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables, and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan Caroline is going to achieve her dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Caroline feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women, so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical, because Caroline will never suffer losses due to delays in delivery of produce to the market, and also she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market, hence an increased income level. Caroline is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community, because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work.

She is 51 years old and currently resides with her husband, Remy, in Taguig City, Philippines. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for more than three years, and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs. She and her partner are working hard and they are determined to have a better income.<br \/><br \/>In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She also offers frozen food products like homemade sausages, hotdogs and other like produce. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.<br \/><br \/>To improve sales, Elsa would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 10,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.<br \/><br \/>In the future, Elsa hopes to maintain an increasing profit from her business. At the same time, she wants to have her own stall someday. She dreams for her family to be always happy and healthy.

She is from Kapsowar, a remote town in the Rift Valley province of Kenya. She has spent the past 10 years of her life farming. She sells milk, maize, and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in personal business, to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nLinah is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. Of all the activities she involves herself in, dairy farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and milk her cows and feed them with fodder that has high nutrient value. She is so keen on and close to her cows, she has named one of them. Milking her cows makes Linah very proud, and she feels fulfilled. \r\n\r\nDairy farming being a very profitable business venture, Linah wants to take full advantage. She would like to expand her dairy business, but the biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital for growth. She is requesting a loan which she will use to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. Linah has planted Napier grass, so feeding the cows will never be a challenge. She also owns an expansive piece of land, and the excess space will be productively used once she acquires the additional dairy cow. \r\n\r\nThe exotic cow she will buy will produce between 10 and 15 litres of milk per day, and this will translate to more income and profits. The profits from milk selling will allow Linah to grow her business further, by starting to package milk and by processing it into other dairy products such as cream. In addition, she will benefit from the organic manure from the cow. She projects that in the future she will be able to start a biogas plant at her farm, which will save her money in fuel costs. With your loan, all that Linah dreams of is a secure future for her children.\r\n\r\nLinah awaits your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":119.36,"image":{"id":1861722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy an exotic, high-quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-24T21:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-24T21:30:04Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Linah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":21700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1535.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1580.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1626.85},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1674.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1723.32},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1773.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1825.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1878.88},{"due_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1933.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1990.3},{"due_date":"2016-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2048.47},{"due_date":"2016-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2108.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.21},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.85},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.44},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.03},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.65},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.28},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.93},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.6},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.19,"local_amount":5051.21,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5433.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588283},{"amount":61.17,"local_amount":5309.68,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5711.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111528}],"funded_date":"2015-04-25T22:31:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":872160,"name":"Fredrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello world! Meet Fredrick, an educated and seasoned 65 year old farmer from Kanyakine village in the Nkubu area of Kenya. Fredrick is married to a lovely wife. They have been married for 35 years and blessed with 3 children. <br \/><br \/>Fredrick started farming 30 years ago. On his 3.5 acre farm, he keeps 3 dairy cows, 30 head of poultry, 3 goats and several sheep. In terms of plants, he has over 30 trees and a garden that contains maize, bananas and coffee.<br \/><br \/>Fredrick is very disciplined: He always records expenses, updates his budget every month, and is concerned about human activities that are responsible for climate change. Fredrick is seeking a KES 80,000 loan from Kiva lenders that will change the way he conducts his business forever. He will use the money to buy a chaff cutter and feed for his animals. The chaff cutter will be used to chop hay into small even sizes that his cow will enjoy to chew.

A smallholder farmer from Ndaragwa, Kenya, Rhoda is the mother of two children. Like many farmers in the region, she keeps a dairy cow, as Ndaragwa has a thriving market for dairy products. Rhoda has sustained herself through dairy farming for 10 years now and enjoys the farming lifestyle. She has a connection with farm animals that goes deep, to the extent that she names each of them. \r\n\r\nRoda has aspirations of expanding her dairy farm, but due to financial constraints, she has been unable to do so until now. From Kiva lenders, Rhoda is kindly requesting KES 50,000 to purchase a high-yielding dairy cow. This cow will boost milk production on the farm, and as a result, she will have more  for both consumption and sales.

She is a super incredible farmer! She certainly ranks among the top successful smallholder farmers on Juhudi Kilimo's client list. \r\n\r\nBorn in 1971, into a humble family, Esther's upbringing was difficult. She attended school and cleared secondary, after which she got into mixed farming 20 years ago. She also got married to a lovely and good looking husband. Together, they are blessed with four children. \r\n\r\nEsther practices farming on a five-acre farm that is owned by the family in the village of Kachibora. On the farm, she grows maize and a variety of food crops. She also keeps more than four highly productive dairy cows for milk production. The 44-year-old farmer sells her produce in bulk two kilometers from her home. Her key clients are the Cereal Board, institutions and local people. She is also a good member of Kibangenge Group, a group she formed to help members who are smallholder farmers to save and use the savings to access loans from financial institutions. \r\n\r\nEsther is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to buy poultry. The Kitale area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 120,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nAs a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and that she will be able to buy more poultry. With the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate into increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry market to other markets, and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. \r\n\r\nEsther has a great credit history. Profits from this investment will be put back into the business to fuel further growth. So much space on her land still remains for future growth. If ever there was an opportunity to invest a $25 loan in someone's future, it is here. You won't regret

of Kenya\u2019s young people struggle to make their way in the world. Monica, 28, is based in the Kapsowar area of Kenya and is a mother. She has been practicing mixed farming for the past 5 years. She has managed to earn a decent income. Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business that she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves dairy farming and when asked what is most enjoyable about her business, she stated \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d Her hobby is milking her cow. She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming and she cannot meet the demand. For this reason she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10-20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit and increased income. Profits from selling milk will be used to repay the loan in full and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. Monica is very visionary and she intends that in the near future she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling and selling dairy products. An improved income will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":170.69,"image":{"id":1861801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Meet Gladys, a smallholder dairy farmer in Kapletundi village in South Rift area of Kenya. Gladys is hardworking and committed to growth and expansion of her business. Her main income source is milk. However, this year she is focusing on something slightly different, horticultural farming.<br \/><br \/>Normally, horticultural farming complements dairy farming very well. Great farmers, like Gladys, are encouraged to do mixed farming in order to improve income levels and also cut costs. Gladys is seeking a KES 70,000 loan to venture into crop farming.<br \/><br \/>With your investment, Gladys will benefit from mixed farming in the following ways: She will make more income because she produces more products from her farm; she will cut costs by using byproducts from dairy, such as using cow dung for manure and using maize stalks as feed; she will manage risks by having different products coming out throughout the year."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":232.86,"image":{"id":1861803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to grow crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-25T00:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-25T00:10:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.37,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3010.57},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3098.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3189.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3282.31},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3378.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3476.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3578.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3683.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3790.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3901.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4015.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4132.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4253.76},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4378.07},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4506.02},{"due_date":"2016-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4637.71},{"due_date":"2016-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4773.25},{"due_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4912.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.8},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.02},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.28},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.91},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.14},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":82.63,"local_amount":7712.21,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:36Z","rounded_local_amount":7715.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460147},{"amount":75.21,"local_amount":7019.43,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":7022.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588290},{"amount":74.65,"local_amount":7001.71,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":7004.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.37,"payment_id":731023401}],"funded_date":"2015-05-08T16:33:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":872239,"name":"Miriama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Miriama is a 42-year-old mother with one child.

This 53-year-old lady has been doing dairy farming for very many years. Her main income source is milk. This year, however, she is seeking to venture into crop farming, which she will do alongside dairy farming. \r\n\r\nTo get started is very expensive due to the high cost of farm inputs and labour.

Meet Jane. She is a 51-year-old smallholder farmer based in Ndaragwa, which is a small rural town in the Central region of Kenya. Jane and her husband have been blessed with six children. \r\n\r\nFor thirty years, Jane has been a mixed farmer. She keeps dairy cattle and poultry on her farm. She also grows vegetables, among other crops. Despite prevailing animal diseases, she finds dairy farming to be the most enjoyable commercial farming activity. \r\n\r\nBesides dairy farming, she has a deep connection with gardening. In African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive, hobby for women. You really don't have to be born with a green thumb to give life to a glorious garden; any woman with a homestead and a few square feet of earth is doing her best to make her little corner of the world more gracious and beautiful. \r\n\r\nJane, however, is taking this a little step further. She is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming. This is a big deal for her. She is very excited to start growing different varieties of crops for commercial purposes. The demand for vegetables and other greens is always high. \r\n\r\nIncome from this venture will cover the high farming expenses she has to deal with currently. In the long run, with increased income, she will finally be able to satisfy her family\u2019s basic needs.\r\n\r\nKindly help her out!\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":256.5,"image":{"id":1861816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ndaragwa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-25T00:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-25T00:50:05Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.83,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2016-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.22},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.89},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.2},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.08},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.41,"local_amount":4030.86,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4053.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588291},{"amount":99.03,"local_amount":9433.86,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":9486.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.57,"payment_id":711506546},{"amount":50.82,"local_amount":4742.86,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4769.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.26,"payment_id":731023402},{"amount":60.41,"local_amount":5609.87,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5640.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111532}],"funded_date":"2015-04-28T21:37:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":872235,"name":"Winny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Winny is a smallholder farmer from Litein region of Kenya who is looking to do more crop farming on her land this year besides dairying.

She makes an average monthly income of up to 7,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to Bai Tushum and requested a loan of 55,000 som (KGS) to buy fertilizers and seeds for land cultivation.

In order to further grow her business, Nurjamal has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) to buy one cow and therefore increase her livestock headcount.

It has running water, electricity, gas and sewage. \r\n\r\nHis business is tailoring, which includes: carrying out an interview with the client, selecting the design, taking measurements, making the patterns and proceeding to cut. They fit the details and the garment is delivered on a hanger and in a bag. \"A good tailor knows how to cut, adapt, put the pieces together, hem, add edging, and sew the clothing well...\" he comments. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of his business is that for the years of experience he has, he can count on a portfolio of established clients. The disadvantage is the lack of money to invest in buying fabric. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to open a suit shop. He wants to expand his business through the purchase of bolts of fabric to make dress suits. This is the 1st sequence of loans with the institution in 21 years that he has been doing this work. It is for these reasons that Ernesto is asking for a loan to buy bolts of fabric to make suits, in order to open a dress suit shop.

Jeniffer is a smallholder mixed farmer from Kapsowar, a rural town in the North Rift area of Kenya. She has been blessed with a lovely family. \r\n\r\nShe has been a farmer for five years, producing milk, eggs and maize for both consumption and sale. Jeniffer's entrepreneurial spirit extends outside agriculture; she is involved in other personal businesses for extra income. \r\n\r\nJeniffer is very ambitious. She enjoys making more and more returns but lacks lacking adequate capital puts her on a leash. It is for this reason that she is turning to Kiva lenders for a loan. \r\n\r\nJeniffer is seeking KES 11,350 to purchase a cow. With more cows, she will be able to utilize the pasture on her farm and increase milk production.

She is pictured standing in the centre of the above group. \r\n\r\nNasimbanu is the proprietor of a petty store, a neighborhood convenience store that sells household necessities. Ghee, packaged tea, cleaning acid, phenyl and incense sticks (agarbattis) are among the items she stocks for regular sale at her store.\r\n\r\nShe wants to expand her small-scale business, as the store has the potential to earn at least INR 6,000 a month, significantly more than the INR 4,000 that she currently earns. Obtaining credit for expansion is challenging because it is mostly available from local moneylenders who charge exorbitant interest rates. A crowd-funded micro loan, on the other hand, will give her the space to expand without the crushing burden of debt. The capital raised from the loan will help Nasimbanu boost her inventory of items currently sold at the petty store.

Samabibi, 29, is pictured standing in the middle of the group. \r\n\r\nSamabibi owns and operates an ice cart, a small-scale business that sees a major uptick in business during the summer. Ice lollies, ice-cream bars, cold sherbet and chilled soda are among the items she stocks in her cart. This micro business helps her earn about INR 3,000 in a month. With the infusion of a little capital, she will be able to stock additional quantities of the items she sells and also offer her customers a greater variety of cold treats. Samabibi expects to see an increased income of INR 5,000 and hopes to save more money for the education of her three children. She believes that a holistic education is the best asset she can leave behind for her children.\r\n\r\nFaridaben, Amirbibi, Kanijabibi and Dituben are the other members of this group. They own and operate petty stores that sell household conveniences. Samabibi and her group collectively seek a loan of INR 70,000 to fund the expansion of their small-scale businesses. The loan amount will help them purchase fresh stocks of goods for their businesses. The increased income will guarantee a better education for their children and an improved standard of living for their families in the long run. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be disbursed and administered by Prayas, an organization that helps rural women entrepreneurs expand the scale of their operations by improving their entrepreneurial and marketing skills, and helping them access credit on fair terms.

He started in 2008 with a fund of 100,000 francs that enabled him to purchase an ox for 150 000 francs by giving an advance and owing a sum of 50,000 francs to the seller that he ultimately repaid. Since then he has grown his business and now owns a cow and her two small calves and an ox.  Starting at 8 am, he goes out with the animals to take them grazing in the fields. They return at night when he gives them animal feed to strengthen them and a lot of water. To sell as well as to purchase, he goes to the weekly markets where he can sometimes find animals for a good price.  Ibrahima is married and father of a family.  He lives with his family and shares the daily expenses with his brothers in the house.  He has already received six loans from IMCEC, all for his animal fattening business.

come to the city to work as street vendors. Most of them come not because they like the job, but to earn money to feed their families the next day. Their tell different stories of women trying to find a better future for their families. Memory is a street vendor who wakes up before the break of dawn to compete with other women for fresh farm supplies in Mbare, a local vegetable market. She would not have made it in the streets of Harare if it were not for her strong character that she brought with her from her rural home. \r\n\r\nThings have never been easy for Memory. During the day, she has to be brave and face the hot weather of Harare with her child on her back, fight running battles with the council police and endure verbal insults from passers-by, just to make sure she puts food on the table for her two children. When she and her three friends heard about Thrive Microfinance, they set up a group called Privilege and attended training. After receiving a group loan, Memory has been able to buy groceries for resale at her shop, which is located near her home. She has been able to feed her family and pay the rent with her profits. The group hopes that a loan from Kiva will help them to continue managing their businesses profitably, send their children to school, and buy basic food to keep them healthy and alive.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1862135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more goods to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-04-25T16:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-25T16:50:04Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merjury","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pretty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pauline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":191.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":191.67,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":191.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649745801},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":191.67,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:36:16Z","rounded_local_amount":191.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665235565},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":191.67,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":191.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681541960},{"amount":191.99,"local_amount":191.99,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":191.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696747217},{"amount":191,"local_amount":191,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:00:44Z","rounded_local_amount":191,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711678898},{"amount":192,"local_amount":192,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":192,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731183024}],"funded_date":"2015-04-29T09:43:58Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T17:29:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":872433,"name":"Daughters Of Zion Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Equipped with an inherited heavy-duty printing machine and enthusiasm, Florence\u2019s dream has been to run her own printing company.

Her husband is an engineer who has worked in Botswana for the last four years.\r\n\r\nDue to a shortage of funds, Scholastic and her peers who had the same vision as she did created a loan group Schoshy to access funds and training from Thrive Microfinance. The training they received opened up their minds, especially on the issue of savings and bookkeeping. With this loan Scholastic wants to raise four batches of chickens simultaneously, at an interval of two weeks, so that she supplies a local butchery which is located in the light Industrial area in Harare. She has a contract to supply this facility with 200 birds per month, and is looking forward to finishing building her house in Kuwadzana, where she lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1862124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to increase the size of her poultry business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-04-25T16:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-25T16:50:04Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Keresiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Scholastic","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Masbee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beauty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":208.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":208.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649745800},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:36:16Z","rounded_local_amount":208.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665235564},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":208.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681541959},{"amount":208.01,"local_amount":208.01,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":208.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696747216},{"amount":209,"local_amount":209,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":209,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711678897},{"amount":208,"local_amount":208,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":208,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731183023}],"funded_date":"2015-04-28T20:59:07Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T17:29:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":872430,"name":"Done Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anna is a member of Done Group.
