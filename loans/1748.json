She started business as a tomatoes vendor after her husband stopped working. Her small business grew to a small vegetable stall also selling snacks and refreshments, at the local Lusaka market. \r\n\r\nThe small profits she was getting enabled her to support her small family and apply for a passport. After the acquisition of her passport Pumzani added cross border trading to her business. After hearing about Thrive Pumuzani her friend\u2019s formed Tagoneswa group. They participate in a lot of trainings availed to them.

Her business is selling chicken. She is a good mother, dedicated, patient, sympathetic, optimistic, responsible and hardworking. She carries out her business in the 'Mallasa' zone, situated near the urban area. It's of agreeable climate and one can visit all year.\r\n\r\nCristina has tanned skin, long black hair that she keeps braided, brown eyes, short stature, dressed in the traditional form (hat, shawl and skirt). She is of medium physical complexion, her mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1 which she speaks with her family and she speaks Spanish because of general culture and because of the business she does. (Seated to the left, she's supporting her baby in her lap).\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her husband, who works as a carrier and with her children. The eldest study in the school, the youngest daughter isn't school age yet. They live in their own house constructed from brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof that has well water, electricity and doesn't have sewage.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of improving her activity led her to forming a bank of people to apply for a loan and improve their activities with businesses like: sale of brooms, engineering studies, sale of salte\u00f1as [regional food], sale of food, sale of fruit, a bookstore and sale of second-hand clothing. Her business is the sale of chicken: she is in charge of buying chicken from the farm to take it to market and offer it at a higher price. She does this work alone in the market of the area. \"I started my business with my mom who doesn't work anymore, sometimes my oldest son helps,\" she comments.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she has old and continuous clients, the disadvantage is the lack of operating capital. Her dream is to finish constructing her house. She wishes to buy chicken in bulk to increase her offering, grow her sales and finish constructing her house. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in the 5 years she's dedicated to this activity.\r\n\r\nIt's for these reasons that Cristina is applying for a loan for the purchase of chicken in bulk to increase her offering, improve her sales and finish constructing her house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3375,"image":{"id":1859536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy chicken in bulk to increase her offering, improve her sales and finish constructing her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-04-25T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-25T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":3375,"lender_count":104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Remedios Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alison Milenka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Karem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ximena Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-19T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-23T04:00:00Z","amount":2349.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T04:00:00Z","amount":2643.94},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T04:00:00Z","amount":2740.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T04:00:00Z","amount":2820.07},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T04:00:00Z","amount":2958.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":3050.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T04:00:00Z","amount":3161.31},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T04:00:00Z","amount":3276.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":344.71},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.97},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":402.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":413.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":434.16},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":447.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":463.89},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":480.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":732.68,"local_amount":4993.07,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5026.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046643},{"amount":402.09,"local_amount":2740.19,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2758.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344463},{"amount":413.82,"local_amount":2820.07,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2838.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554676},{"amount":434.16,"local_amount":2958.75,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2978.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468763},{"amount":447.59,"local_amount":3050.27,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3070.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296602},{"amount":944.66,"local_amount":6437.65,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":6480.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076805}],"funded_date":"2015-05-21T12:02:45Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alex Martin","image":1188596}},{"id":872636,"name":"Carmen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmen is 66 years old and lives in Butuay, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental.

She got her opportunity when her brother, working abroad, gave her capital of PhP 150,000 which she used to rent a space, bought two beds and hired a massage therapist to help her with massage service.

Russel makes sure that her employees have employee benefits and supports them through formal training, if they want to apply abroad or to a more exclusive spa center.  \r\n\r\nToday, with growing customers, Russel wanted to expand her spa and rent another space to be made into a spa massage center, but her lack of capital prevents her from doing so.\r\n\r\nNow Russel is requesting a loan amounting to PhP 100,000 to buy two massage beds, oils, curtains, towels and rental payment for the space for her new spa.

His wife is helping him with their business of wholesale hardware store and grocery store. <br \/><br \/>Bryan has been accustomed to hard work since he was eight years old. Living in the province with his grandmother in a poor life status, he learned to sell rice cakes and vegetables after school. As  a teen he experienced working as an eggs, crackers and fish ball vendor and worked as a janitor in a mall to earn a living.  Bryan dreamed of having his own business someday so he saved most of his earned money and he used the rest to support his grandmother in the province. <br \/><br \/>Bryan's business opportunity came to life in 2004 when he roamed the market in their community and took orders to deliver cooking oil and condiments (vinegar, fish sauce and soy sauce) from his savings of PHP 5,000 and from there on his business grew. He was taking more orders and delivering his goods to most of the local store areas in their community. <br \/><br \/>But like most businesses, Bryan also experienced a downfall in 2007 when his family became sick and frequently hospitalized so he spent most of his income and capital to finance the expenses. Together with a bad partnership, his business went bankrupt. <br \/><br \/>Instead of giving up, Brian tried again using what was left of his money. He roamed his community for orders, this time asking for hardware and grocery orders and delivered them to their doorstep. He delivered them himself, oblivious to the backbreaking work of carrying heavy packages for his customers and working seven days a week.  <br \/><br \/>Bryan now has four branches of his wholesale hardware and grocery store with 17 employed helpers.

Alberta and her group members are the only local distributors of Elsa clean cook stoves in their community. Due to the availability of fuel, which is waste material within their community, the demand for the Elsa stove is very high within the community and its surrounding villagers. The Elsa clean cook stove uses palm kernel shells as fuel.

He started this job when he was very young when he helped his father cultivate corn and wheat, until one day his harvest was so good that his father paid him enough to buy his own cow, and he started becoming independent little by little. Now, he already has seven years cultivating his own corn and taking care of the cows, which have been multiplying little by little thanks to his effort. Nowadays, Abel is married and has two young children, who are five and a year old, and who motivate him to move ahead. He has seven years working in his own business, and he wants to invest more. For this, he is requesting a loan to buy poultry manure and quarry stone to build a drinking trough for the cows. This loan will allow him to take better care of his cows, so he is able to have quality milk in order to be able to sell them. Among his plans is to request another loan in the future to buy two more cows.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1861234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy poultry manure and quarry stone.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2015-04-25T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-25T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abel Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":408.12,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":408.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":408.12,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752133320}],"funded_date":"2015-04-28T12:06:25Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T17:12:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Mueller","image":null}},{"id":872715,"name":"Ni Nyoman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ni Nyoman, 40 years old, lives in Sadnyasari village, West Bali where most of the inhabitants work as farmers, breeders, salesmen and service workers.

She is a widow and mother of eight children. Her youngest son is nine years old and her eldest daughter is 29. Zhyldyz has a secondary education and long work experience: she worked as an assistant cook in a school cafeteria, and worked for nine years as a shop assistant. Now Zhyldyz farms and receives a surviving widow's pension of 3,887 som (KGS). Through hard work, today Zhyldyz has two cows and 25 sheep on her farmstead, and also cultivates 6.0 hectares of land on which she mostly grows beans. Her children and close relatives help her on the farm.\r\n\r\nEach month Zhyldyz's family receives a gross income of about 28,000 som (KGS). These are insufficient means to support a large and close-knit family, but Zhyldyz is not disheartened and looks for sources of income.

Meet Lucy, a 33-year-old, youthful, very hardworking, honest, and ever-smiling mother of two children. She lives with her husband in a remote village in Nandihills in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Lucy passionately loves dairy farming. She has been farming for the past four years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding the large family she has requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her large family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets, but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. \r\n<p>\r\nLucy has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good-quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture, and the price of milk in the recent past has been going up. Lucy, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this and is applying for a 60,000 KES loan through Kiva partner Juhudi Kilimo to buy a particular variety of dairy cow. She will not only get milk from the cow but also manure that will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market, and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. \r\n<p>\r\nLucy said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agriculture-based loans and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis.

Just like many farmers in the area, Penninah also does crop farming for subsistence but milk is her main source of income. This year, she is planning to focus more on crop cultivation and making it bigger. She is seeking a loan of KES 20,000 which she will use to purchase tools and farm inputs such as fertilizer and seedlings.

the Nandihills area of Kenya she commands a lot of respect. For the past seven years she has been involved in mixed farming, and because of her immense knowledge, farmers flock to her home to seek technical advice on the best techniques. Naum has identified free space on her farm that she wants to fully utilize by keeping a good-quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture, and milk prices have been going up in the recent past. Naum, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this trend. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she knows that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure to boost the fertility of her farm. Selling her milk should never be a problem because there is a ready market, and she will also be selling to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nNaum said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural loans, and their interest rate is low and is on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro-finance institutions. Naum hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting to offer services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. She hopes that this loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":255.18,"image":{"id":1862642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-26T00:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-26T00:10:04Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.25,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naum","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.18,"local_amount":4561.62,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4685.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460157},{"amount":35.52,"local_amount":3229.42,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3316.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378575},{"amount":42.34,"local_amount":3848.68,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3952.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588307},{"amount":39.99,"local_amount":3729.45,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3830.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.03,"payment_id":711506553},{"amount":44.76,"local_amount":4089.12,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4199.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.22,"payment_id":731023416},{"amount":41.14,"local_amount":3739.79,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3841.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111540}],"funded_date":"2015-04-26T03:37:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Henry Goodman","image":null}},{"id":872792,"name":"Shem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shem is 49 years old, married with four children, and living in Kasese Uganda.

farming for a living. She is a self-driven lady who believes in the coming together of people to overcome challenges and obstacles. \r\n\r\nIn Koibarak village where she comes from, farmers lack financial services. Agnes rounded up a group of them on a mission to get ahead but lacking  adequate financial resources. They formed Chemwon Group, and Agnes was appointed the chair lady. The group started saving and table banking and soon sought financial resources using their savings and group cohesion as security.

She is a 27-year-old mother who lives with her family in the Nandihills area of Kenya. She is blessed with a lovely family who are her greatest motivation in life to persevere, because she wants to provide them with a better future. Joan was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past 7 years. She is an early riser who goes to her farm to earn a living. \r\n\r\nJoan has space on her farm to use for dairy farming, so she respectfully requests a loan to buy a dairy cow. Nandihills is an area that has a large population and there is a high demand for milk. Joan, being an enterprising person, wants to take full advantage of that need and earn extra income. She hopes that this loan will allow her to change her standard of living and expand her milk-selling business. \r\n\r\nJoan plans to open a very large milk-selling business in the nearby shopping center and to package milk. She wants to be economically empowered.

Consolata is 35 years old and a proud mother of three lovely angel-looking children, whom she really adores and cherishes. Aside from doing a side hustle business, Consolata is a hardworking farmer who has been farming for the past fourteen years. She has gained so much experience through those years of farming. <br \/><br \/>Consolata practices mixed farming, growing maize and keeping dairy cows. Through these activities she has been able to earn a decent and honest income. Because of the passion she has for farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows Salat. She really enjoys taking care of her dairy cows. Although Consolata has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious mum. She needs to increase her land. She is respectfully requesting a loan to buy more land. Through this loan, her cows will have enough grazing land and she will be able to plant more crops on the land. Through the purchased land, Consolata will be assured of a better harvest, and this will translate into more profits and cash.

She is seeking a loan of KES 63,100 to buy a heifer. Part of the loan amount will also be used to insure the newly acquired asset. Jane plans to sell milk from the cow daily and use the money to clear her debt, which is consolidated into monthly installments.\r\n\r\nIn the future, once she is done servicing the loan, she will seek a second loan to buy another cow. The milk sold from the first cow will generate her personal income and the milk from the second cow will be used to service the second loan. With continued support from lenders, Jane will gradually but surely increase her asset base, advance her credit record and make more income -- all ingredients to becoming the target client of big financial institutions like commercial banks. Her main goal is to grow her business and to raise the living standards of her family.

lenders! Meet Joyce, 27 years of age and a very hardworking and self-driven farmer who is based in Ekerenyo, a remote village in Nyamia. This region has harsh weather patterns, and poultry farming is the only profitable business venture that thrives. \r\n\r\nJoyce is happily married and blessed with a beautiful family. For the past 15 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary sources of income have been selling milk and crop farming. She passionately loves poultry farming. When asked what is most enjoyable about farming, her reply was \u201cselling eggs.\u201d Her biggest challenge is the lack of funds to increase her poultry farming. She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry.\r\n\r\nJoyce is a member of Omorare Self-help Group and through the group, she has received training on financial management and saving. Through the loan, she will sell eggs to the local market and to her neighbors, hence improving her living conditions and getting out of the poverty situation she is in currently. Profits from the loan will be used in repaying back the loan and increasing her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":59.64,"image":{"id":1862728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy additional poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-26T06:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-26T06:30:05Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.31,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":707.73},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":728.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":749.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":771.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":794.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":817.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":841.26},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":865.84},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":891.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":917.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":944},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":971.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.82},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.8},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":11.04,"local_amount":883.1,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1030.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460160},{"amount":9.5,"local_amount":760.2,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":887.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378579},{"amount":8.84,"local_amount":706.93,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":825.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588312},{"amount":9.82,"local_amount":806.25,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:15Z","rounded_local_amount":941,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.26,"payment_id":711506558},{"amount":10.2,"local_amount":820,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":957.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.05,"payment_id":731023421},{"amount":9.93,"local_amount":794.62,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":927.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111545}],"funded_date":"2015-04-26T07:20:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":872884,"name":"Ninfa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ninfa is 57 years old, a married woman with three children.

cool and wet climate which is ideal for agriculture. However, its rough terrain makes it almost impossible to do crop cultivation on a large scale. Most farmers resort to doing livestock farming and a bit of crop farming for subsistence. \r\n\r\nAs for Salome, dairy farming is working out well for her. She is following up on its success by introducing poultry farming, which has a huge potential in the market. Starting out poultry farming requires having a significant number of hens to make the investment feasible and worthwhile. The main challenge that she is facing currently is lack of adequate capital for this.\r\n \r\nSalome is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to invest in buying a brood of hens.

Zhyldyzkan lives with her son and daughter-in-law. She has a secondary education and, to provide the primary income for her family, has been involved in animal husbandry and farming for 20 years. Thanks to Zhyldyzkan's hard work, today her farm contains 1 cow and 20 sheep, and 2.0 hectares of land, where she grows beans for household consumption and sale. The income from the business is very low and not enough for a decent life. To continue developing her business, Zhyldyzkan requested a loan in the amount of 25,000 som (KGS) from the Bai-Tushum Bank to buy a heifer in order to increase her livestock headcount.

His business is located in the community of Vichaya, located to the west of the city, at an altitude of 4000 meters above sea level, in the highland plains, and which is part of the largest urban agglomeration of the country. The climate is cold all year round and doesn't get above 17 degrees centigrade in the summer. \r\n\r\nPatrih has dark skin and eyes, short dark hair, is short, has a thin physique, his native language is Aymar\u00e1 which he speaks in this place and he also speaks Spanish due to the general culture and the work he does. He shares his life with his partner who works in the same business and with their children who go to school. They live in their own house made of adobe with a roof of metal sheeting, which has electricity. It doesn't have running water or sewer services. His business is making stucco. This is a fine powder made up of lime, crushed marble, plaster, natural dyes, etc. and it becomes hard when it is mixed with water and it is used primarily to cover walls and roofs. \"I began my work because the zone where we live is traditionally a producer of stucco and it is the business of the place...\" he said. The advantage of his business is that he has wholesale purchasers who take care of selling the stucco all over the city. The disadvantage is the lack of water and fuel to work. His dream is to build his business of making stucco on a massive level. He wants to invest in his business through the purchase of firewood and fuel to mine stucco. This is his first loan cycle with the institution in the 5 years that he has been doing this work independently.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Patrih asks for a loan to purchase firewood and fuel to mine stucco and feed his family.

She lives alone, her children are now adults and live with their respective families. Her oldest granddaughter helps her with her business. Her primary activity is her grocery store which she has had since mid-2014. She has her own house, a place in which over 6 months ago, she established a grocery store where she has, with great success, been expanding, distributing basic necessities. She needs to fix up the outdoor walkway and invest in basic products such as rice, beans, sugar and more. She has providers of bread, fruit, and soft drinks who visit her each week and she presents them as credit references. \r\n\r\nDue to a health situation and to avoid walking in the street so much, she opened the grocery store, offering primarily soft drinks and candies, but due to the neighborhood demand, she decided to improve her product offerings. She has an outdoor walkway in her house as a physical space, she has a refrigerator and a computer where she offers telephone charging and payment services. \r\n\r\nFrancisca has 2 sources of income, the grocery store and her pension. The house is her own and she wants to continue working to improve her living conditions. \r\n\r\nShe located her business in her house, in a neighborhood where there isn't any other business of this type and where about 75 people live. The products in the store are gotten directly by the customers. In addition, by being on the main road, many drivers and cyclists stop to refresh themselves in these hot summer days. She has providers of bread, soft drinks and candies who visit her each week and provide references for this application. There isn't any competition in the zone and she uses the suggested prices by the business for the sale of the products. The business is in the process of getting its business license, a process that is ongoing.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":213.39,"image":{"id":1862220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase merchandise and improve the entrance of her grocery store.

She sells milk, eggs, crops, and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Pirickilla is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. She wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. Although she makes profits farming, she has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereal. \r\n\r\nShe seeks a loan to buy cereal because Kenya's Nyamira area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereal. This means that Pirickilla could increase her profits and satisfy the demand.

","en":"Martin is 51 years old, married and father to five children, the youngest of whom is 16 years old, still a dependant and in his penultimate year at high school. The four other children are all adults and no longer live with their family. Martin's wife has a small business selling fruits, while Martin himself runs a small restaurant, which he began in 2008. The couple used to run the restaurant together but now his wife sells fruit so that they can have two different income-generating activites.\r\n\r\nWith his loan Martin is going to be able to improve and diversify the dishes he serves (Malagash specialities) so that he can retain his current customer base and attract new customers.\r\n\r\nThe family owns the house where it lives but each year the neighborhood is flooded during the summer. In the longer term the family intends to acquire another plot of land and build another house in an area which is not exposed to floods.

She is seeking a loan to venture into commercial poultry farming. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will acquire a brood of hens that will lay eggs for food, sale and hatching. This business is projected to significantly increase her income. The birds will also bring life into her home, as they will be free-range and scratch the earth for bugs. \r\n\r\nThe money from the investment will enable Linet to afford basic needs and save up for the future.

Los precios de venta son de cat\u00e1logo y la mercader\u00eda en general se maneja con un margen de ganancia mayor al 50%, esto debido a lo costoso de traerlos a este lugar.

She lives in Chira Island, which is located 45 minutes by boat from the city of Puntarenas. The unemployment rate is high there, and most people fish in order to generate their income. Lenis has worked in the accounting department for different fishing companies in Chira Island. One year ago she decided to start selling products such as clothes, shoes, perfumes, and purses. She also offers banking services and many neighbors use them. In total, she has around forty-five customers.\r\n\r\nShe started selling products on a catalogue to relatives. Orders have increased in a year, so she is in need of working capital. She has different suppliers, such as Ditaires, although she also purchases products in stores located in Puntarenas or San Jos\u00e9. Every second week, she has to pick her deliveries in Puntarenas, which takes her a whole day. She is a person looking to generate income for her family in an area where most people work in fishing.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a family loan of 100,000 colones [CRC]. She offers the banking services at home, and for this she uses her computer. She has a motorcycle and uses it to travel around Chira Island. Her customer base is growing. There are few clothes stores in Chira Island, and few people offers banking services, which means that Lenis can fulfill the needs of locals. She has no competition, and can cover the whole island with the help of her motorcycle. She makes a 50% profit on the products she sells from the catalogues, due to the high costs of bringing them to the island. She sells different seasonal clothes throughout the year. She sells face-to-face and offers seasonal and good-quality products, which makes her business special in an area where goods and services are scarce."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":464.27,"image":{"id":1862228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy clothes, shoes, perfumes, and be able to offer better banking services.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Puntarenas, Isla Chira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2015-04-26T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-26T15:10:04Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lenis ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":39044.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":39630.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":40224.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":40828.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41440.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":42062.16},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":42693.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":43333.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":43983.49},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":44643.24},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45312.89},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45992.58},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":46682.47},{"due_date":"2016-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":47382.71},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":48093.45},{"due_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":48814.85},{"due_date":"2016-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":49547.07},{"due_date":"2016-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50290.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.43},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.18},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.38},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.84},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.1},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.38},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.32},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.68},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.05},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.45},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.53,"local_amount":39100,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-20T12:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":39596.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666210373},{"amount":75.65,"local_amount":39686.5,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":40190.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681351471},{"amount":76.79,"local_amount":40281.8,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":40793.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696781560},{"amount":77.9,"local_amount":40863.34,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-24T12:13:43Z","rounded_local_amount":41382.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":713908391},{"amount":79.11,"local_amount":41498.97,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-19T12:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":42025.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731625120},{"amount":80.29,"local_amount":42121.46,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-02T13:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":42656.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752084057}],"funded_date":"2015-05-08T20:18:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Santiago Mejia Dugand","image":1321107}},{"id":873002,"name":"Annie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annie is a 44-year-old married woman with six children, two of whom are in school.

She is 58 years old and the mother of 13 children, aged 21 to 42, of whom three are currently in school. \r\n\r\nNagnouma is rooted in the family tradition of farming, the main source of income and of food self-sufficiency at home. So she was encouraged to do this work for 50 years. She grows peanuts on her parcel of land. But, as a farmer, she must cope with difficulties, such as the lack of rain and of farm supplies. \r\n\r\nNagnouma is starting her first year with myAgro and signed up because of the quality seeds and the training in farming techniques. This year, she is making payments to purchase a myAgro packet of OPV seeds and some fertilizer for growing peanuts, so as to increase her yields on her parcel of 1.75 hectares. She has been growing peanuts for 50 years for its value as a staple food. She explains that peanuts are directly consumable by the family and are used as a base for cooking sauces. Peanuts also have commercial value, since they are a food she sells on the market. \r\n\r\nWith greater yields and higher income, Nagnouma is planning on buying some farm supplies and equipment. Ultimately, she hopes also to be able to build a house for the family, as well as plan for her children\u2019s marriages.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1862179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a packet of OPV seeds and some fertilizer for growing peanuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kenieroba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-04-26T15:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-26T15:10:05Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nagnouma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":263500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":263500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":263500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":273370.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401556}],"funded_date":"2015-04-26T16:01:55Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:14:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":872509,"name":"Salvaci\u00f3n  Divina Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u00a8Salvaci\u00f3n Divina\u00a8, un grupo mixto compuesto por 3 mujeres  y 1 hombre, todos ellos con negocios diferentes pero con un objetivo sacar adelante a sus familias.
