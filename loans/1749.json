But, as a farmer, she must cope with difficulties, such as the lack of rain and of farm supplies. \r\n\r\nMamine is starting her first year with myAgro and signed up because of the payment system and the possibility of increasing her yields through the services offered by myAgro. This year, she is making payments to purchase a myAgro packet of OPV seeds and some fertilizer for growing peanuts, so as to increase her yields on her parcel of 0.125 hectare. She has been growing peanuts for 37 years for its commercial as a staple food. She explains that peanuts are directly consumable by the family and are used in cooking as a sauce base. Peanuts also have commercial value, since she sells them on the market.\r\n\r\nWith greater yields and higher income, Mamine is planning on extending her arable land.

She is the mother of five children who are under her care from her marriage. Naom completed her secondary school education thanks to the financial support and effort of her parents, but never advanced. This never killed the spirit she has for succeeding in life. Naom has been farming for the past fifteen years and through mixed farming, she has been able to take care of her family. She loves dairy farming. <br \/><br \/>Although Naom passionately loves farming, she faces the challenge of water shortages. Most of the rain water goes to waste, which is why she is seeking a loan to buy a water tank. Naom comes from an area where there is no piped water. Therefore this water tank will assist her to harvest water during the rainy seasons and also store water for home consumption. Harvested water will assist Naom to irrigate her farm, ensuring that there is a constant production of crops. This loan will turn around the life of Naom as she will no longer have to walk for long distances in search of this precious commodity water, hence saving her time."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":222.73,"image":{"id":1862934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a water tank","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-26T16:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-26T16:30:05Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.33,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2477.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2549.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2623.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2700.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2779.57},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2860.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2944.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3030.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3119.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3210.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3303.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3400.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.32},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.47},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.39},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.4},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":3499.78,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3517.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460171},{"amount":64.81,"local_amount":6048.72,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":6080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378591},{"amount":32.23,"local_amount":3008.24,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3023.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588325},{"amount":14.78,"local_amount":1409.69,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1416.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.32,"payment_id":711506569},{"amount":36.48,"local_amount":3405.78,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3423.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.01,"payment_id":731023433},{"amount":36.6,"local_amount":3416.14,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3433.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111557}],"funded_date":"2015-05-01T11:58:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Benjamin","image":1467297}},{"id":872528,"name":"Xenia Carolina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Xenia, de 23 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta bachillerato, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ada, su pareja trabaja en la alcald\u00eda municipal y tiene dos hijos. \n\nXenia, tiene su propio negocio de venta de productos de belleza desde hace 3 a\u00f1os, su t\u00eda fue quien le ense\u00f1o acerca de la administraci\u00f3n de este negocio, pues ella tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la venta de estos productos.

Viven en un cuarto propio construido de ladrillo y cemento con techo de calamina que cuenta con agua potable, energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y alcantarillado.

Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 2 a\u00f1os que se dedica a esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Maria solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de mesas, sillas y sombrillas para vender comida a m\u00e1s clientes.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda, 31, lives with her partner.  She has four children, ages 1, 6, 10, and 12.  She's understanding, patient, supportive, strong, optimistic, responsible, and very hardworking, and she's a good mother.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling traditional food.  She works in the southern area of the city, a well-populated residential area with rustic old houses, many without access to basic services, as well as commerce and manufacturing throughout.  The climate is sub-tropical, with temperatures that range from 21 to 35 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is short and dark and of average build; she has brown eyes and wears her brown hair tied back.  Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family; she speaks Spanish for cultural reasons and for business purposes.  (She's in the middle, wearing a dress with pink horizontal stripes and carrying a black purse.)\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her partner, who works in construction, and her children, who attend school, except for the youngest, who is not yet of school age.  They live in their own room built of brick and cement with a corrugated metal roof; they have potable water, electricity, and gas.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's desire to improve her business led her to form a group of people to request a loan and improve their businesses: vegetable sales, empanada sales, costume jewelry sales, weaving wallets, pastry sales, breakfast sales, a hardware store, carpentry, and a tire shop.  Her business is selling traditional food: \"majao encapao\" (ground jerky, boiled plantains, and rice), peanut soup, stuffed locoto (locoto peppers, ground meat, onions), rice with cheese (rice, milk, and cheese), \"aj\u00ed de panza\" (beef belly, onions, and tomatoes served with rice), and other dishes.  She works from Monday through Saturday during lunch and dinner, outside her home protected by two umbrellas and a few benches as seating.  \"I cook some traditional dishes that I have always known how to prepare, and they're the most popular.  That's why I have good sales,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that her customers enjoy her food.  The disadvantage is that she lacks capital for investing.  Her dream is to open a restaurant.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda wants to expand her business with a purchase of tables, chairs, and umbrellas to sell food to more customers, so she's requesting a loan.  This is her first loan sequence with the institution in the two years she has been in this line of work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":1862178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables, chairs, and umbrellas to sell food to her customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-04-26T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-26T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gerardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jimena Michel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelcy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judit","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-23T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":27500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-07T04:00:00Z","amount":2038.76},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T04:00:00Z","amount":2111.62},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T04:00:00Z","amount":2150.06},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T04:00:00Z","amount":2189.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T04:00:00Z","amount":2229.02},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T04:00:00Z","amount":2269.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T04:00:00Z","amount":2310.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T04:00:00Z","amount":2352.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T04:00:00Z","amount":2395.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T04:00:00Z","amount":2439.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T04:00:00Z","amount":2483.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T04:00:00Z","amount":2528.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":296.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.14},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":318.43},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":324.22},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":336.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":348.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":361.28},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":367.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1234.86,"local_amount":8489.63,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:13:10Z","rounded_local_amount":8532.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046648},{"amount":990.47,"local_amount":6809.52,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":6843.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344468},{"amount":690.73,"local_amount":4748.75,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4772.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554680},{"amount":716.1,"local_amount":4923.18,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4947.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468768},{"amount":367.84,"local_amount":2528.92,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2541.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296607}],"funded_date":"2015-05-08T16:56:14Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":872530,"name":"Soraya Shomar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Soraya es una joven mujer de 24 a\u00f1os de edad, soltera, sin hijos, y estudia la carrera de comercio internacional. \nElla es inteligente, responsable, comprometida, constante, dulce, cari\u00f1osa, sensible y sincera.

With this investment he plans to increase his sales having new inventory making this a successful loan from Kiva. <br \/><br \/>Carlos started his business 5 years ago when he was unemployed and manged to get the capital to buy some merchandise and sell it in the domestic market.

Meet Vanis, 26 years of age, a very hardworking, honest, and dedicated farmer who lives in Ekerenyo, a remote village in Nyamira. \r\n\r\nShe is happily married and is blessed with one adorable child. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last three years and has gained so much experience. \r\n\r\nTo afford a decent and comfortable life for her child, Vanis also sells milk, eggs and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and earn extra cash, she has engaged in another small personal business: riding poultry. The Nyamira area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. \r\n\r\nLike many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable and profitable. Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved and that she will be able to buy more poultry. \r\n\r\nThrough this loan, Vanis will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and at the local market. This will translate to increased profits and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, Vanis intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets, and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions.

She has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase cartons of assorted provisions like sardines, powder milk, tin milk, sugar, ovaltines, etc. for resale. In the future, Saffiatu plans to reinvest and develop her business and educate her children.  Her previous loan helped her greatly and she was able to pay her suppliers on time. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":862.5,"image":{"id":1863010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cartons of assorted provisions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2015-04-26T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-26T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saffiatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":625000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":628827.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664994753},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":628827.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681290063},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:48:43Z","rounded_local_amount":628827.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696499288},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:59:41Z","rounded_local_amount":628827.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711410163},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":628827.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730931038},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":628827.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752023031}],"funded_date":"2015-05-01T13:25:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Yan","image":1083582}},{"id":873135,"name":"Mwanajuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanajuma is a married woman.

She sells milk every day and also raises beans on a 3.0 hectare plot of land.  These endeavors provide a monthly income of about 20,000 KGS.  With the goal of further expanding her business, Suluukan turned to the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase 25 sheep.  With the income from the loan Suluukan plans to save toward the further growth of her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1861844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 25 sheep to fatten and resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Dobo village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-04-26T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-26T21:10:03Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Suluukan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":472.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":551.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":551.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-26T20:49:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Whitney Muhlestein","image":null}},{"id":872549,"name":"Amalia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Amalia una adorable persona de 62 a\u00f1os de edad, con esp\u00edritu y ganas de trabajar, ella tiene un negocio, una \u201cchaza\u201d, un puesto de trabajo que cre\u00f3 teniendo un terreno, cerc\u00e1ndolo y protegi\u00e9ndolo con una carpa, donde tiene ubicado congeladores y vitrinas que es donde se exhiben sus productos tal y como se observa en la foto.\n\nElla es una mujer que vive y lucha por lo suyo, se separ\u00f3 de su esposo, no tiene hijos, solo su negocio que un d\u00eda de 1999 inicio con la esperanza de que se convirtiera en su sustento y su medio de progreso y hasta el d\u00eda de hoy ha cumplido su tarea.\n\nAmalia quiere solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo para abastecer su negocio, comprara bebidas principalmente, parte del monto ser\u00e1 destinado a la cancelaci\u00f3n de un pr\u00e9stamo que tiene vigente. \n\n","en":"Amaila is 62 years old and she has a \u201cchaza,\u201d a work location she created on a piece of land that she fenced in and protected it with a tent.

When he started farming, Wilfred only had hopes and dreams. Now, the farm has two cows, 30 head of poultry, goats and rabbits, two dozen trees, tomatoes, cabbage and kale. Due to the climatic conditions of the area, his farm is also equipped with irrigation equipment. \r\n\r\nWilfred is seeking a  KES 100,000 loan to:\r\n1. Expand his horticultural farm\r\n2. Construct a cowshed\r\n3. Fence his farmland.\r\n\r\nHe has managed to save a bit of his own salary money from a job that he has: the loan amount will top this up to the amount required for the whole project.\r\n \r\nWilfred has always practised horticultural farming to meet commercial ends and dairy farming for subsistence. However, as the population of the country increases, farmers have had to increase their farms' milk production to more than just what was sufficient for their families. The demand for more milk drove Wilfred to acquire two high yielding dairy cows for milk production. To make the cows' environment more conducive, he is planning to construct a cowshed for them. He is also planning to fence the farmland to control animals moving onto the crop section and destroying what he has planted.\r\n \r\nYour investment will mean the world to Wilfred and his family as it will push their farming business to a whole new level. With the boost will come higher living standards for them all.

","en":"Khayrinisso is 34 years old, married, and the mother of two boys, who are 11 and 8 years old.  Her children study in secondary school and her husband works as a builder.  Khayrinisso is a talented and active woman, and sews women's clothing from home.  Khayrinisso began this business 5 years ago and is already an experienced seamstress.  She enjoys sewing traditional Tajik women's clothing.  Khayrinisso wants to improve her work process - her current sewing machine does not work well enough.  She is asking for a loan to purchase a new sewing machine, but will also use part of the money to buy fabric and sewing supplies.  This loan will help her to expand her business and to get more

He is happily married and has been blessed with seven angelic looking children.\r\n\r\nHe has farmed for the past 12 years and has never regretted it. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs, and crops. Most of the small-holder farmers in Kilibwoni village own approximately \u00bc acre of land per household, and this has made them work extra hard to fully utilize their farms.\r\n\r\nSolomon has been able to earn a decent and honest living by selling milk and eggs. These ventures have enabled him to send his children to school and feed his family. Solomon has planted many trees on his compound and also has Napier grass, which has high protein and is used to feed his dairy cow. This enhances his milk-selling profits.\r\n\r\nBecause of increased demand, Solomon requests a loan to buy a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is a very profitable venture, and he wants to take full advantage of the ready market for dairy products. Through the loan, Solomon is sure of satisfying the demand for milk in his area. He plans to add value to his milk through packaging. He also hopes to one day start manufacturing milk products such as yoghurt and cream.\r\n\r\nThrough increased profits, Solomon is sure that he will repay the loan on time and also be in a position to comfortably take care of his family. Juhudi Kilimo, through its training, has helped Solomon to save more effectively.\r\n\r\nSolomon, with his entrepreneurial spirit, strength and tenacity, would like to continue fighting so that he can achieve his dream of owning his own business and empowering society by being a source of employment.

famous Mount Kenya. Silas, 27, has been farming for the past 10 years. Through these years, he has gained much experience and is considered among the best farmers in his village. He practices mixed farming. His primary sources of income are milk, eggs, crops, and some small business ventures that help him make ends meet. \r\n\r\nSilas is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating his farm. That is why, every day, he wakes up very early to go to his farm to plow. Although he makes profits from farming, he is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase his income by selling cereals. That is why he is seeking this loan: to buy cereal. Kenya's Chuka area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereal. This means that Silas could increase his profits and satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Silas, but he now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring farmers like him turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Silas believes that this loan will be of much help, and that he will be able to satisfy the demand for cereal. He also believes that the extra income he earns will enable a permanent change in his life and improve his business. Increased profits will allow Silas to repay this loan and secure the future of his school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":109.05,"image":{"id":1863128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-27T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-27T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.01,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.64,"local_amount":3345.98,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3531.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460174},{"amount":34.43,"local_amount":3060.04,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3229.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588329},{"amount":36.97,"local_amount":3287.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3469.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.01,"payment_id":731023436}],"funded_date":"2015-05-06T02:08:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":873215,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatuma is a single woman and owns a house that has piped water but no electricity.

Thanks to her very hard work, Gulmira currently makes an average monthly income of about 10,500 som (KGS).  She has two dairy cows and 30 sheep on her farm.  She also owns 2.22 hectares of irrigated land on which she grows beans for resale and for the farm's own usage.  In order to further develop her business, Gulmira has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy 10 sheep and some feed for her livestock.

She has a specialist high school education and works as an operator at a territorial self-government institution. She also has been working in agriculture since 2002 as an additional source of income for her family.

She has a college education and works for the city council.  In order to provide an additional source of income for her family, she is also involved in agriculture, an activity she started 15 years ago.  Thanks to her very hard work, her farming business comprises two hectares of land on which she grows potatoes for resale.  She makes 18,000 som (KGS) every month from this activity.  Eager to further grow her business, Aigul has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) to buy seed potatoes and fertilizers.

Being a father has been his main reason to tirelessly struggle day by day, looking for alternatives to earn his living and to support his children. Approximately 10 years ago, he started farming.  Reuben is hardworking and determined to make it in the world of farming. The land he owns is big enough to support more than just dairy animals. He is planning to make use of the available space to start growing food crops. <br \/><br \/>Starting a horticultural farm is very costly, especially for small-holder rural farmers. Besides securing land space, a farmer needs to invest in intensive labour, farm tools, and farm inputs. The farmer will also have to construct a store\/granary for his\/her produce.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mary\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of four acres of land and purchase a total of seven solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1803171,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase two solar lights and gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-27T03:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-27T03:10:08Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josphat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":75180,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75180}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-19T04:13:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":873296,"name":"Johanna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Johanna is a 59-year-old jovial and energetic woman who has overcome the loss of her husband to take on the challenge of starting a business.\r\n\r\nShe worked as a domestic worker but left when her husband passed away, citing that she had lost the energy to carry on working.

year was the same amount that one of his customers spent in a month. The realization made him decide to take a risk: start his own company and build a more profitable future for himself. He started his own cleaning company providing services for commercial venues, offices, and the hospitality sector.\r\n\r\nMaceo comes from a family of self-made men. Two of his uncles owned a shipping company and an import\/export business in the Bahamas. Another uncle was Prime Minister of Security in the Bahamas. With these influences, Maceo has been driven to create his own economically sustainable and stable future. He has already experienced great successes.

She has a party decoration business. She is a good mother who is independent, perseverant, understanding, funny, responsible, and very hard-working. She carries out her business in the area of 'Cruce Villa Adela', where business has flourished in the past few years.  In the past, commerce there was reduced to bars, kiosks, and pharmacies, but now it includes banks, schools, taxi stands, public bathrooms, shops, and hardware stores, among other things.  The climate is cold and dry with a temperature that varies during the day from 0 to 12\u00b0C.  Marisol has a dark complexion, long grey hair that wears in braids, and brownish-grey eyes, with an average build and short stature.  She wears traditional clothing (hat, cloak, and skirt) and her maternal tongue is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish with the general public and when doing business. In the photo, she is seated farthest to the right wearing a blue cloak.\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her husband who works as an electrician, and they live in their own home made of brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof that has potable water, electricity, and plumbing.  Her desire to improve led her to form a credit group so that the members could take out a loan and improve their businesses.  They sell things such as as wool sweaters, empanadas, oil in bulk, cellphone accessories, breakfast, and children's skirts and hats.  She has a party decoration business.  She is in charge of decorating all kinds of environments for parties, christenings, weddings, children's birthday parties,  and engagement parties, among others, and she does this work every day of the week, working and receiving orders fom her fixed store during the day.   She generally does the decorating on the weekends.  She notes that every detail counts in party decoration, from the flowers that she chooses to decorate with up to the napkins that accompany the dishes.  The advantage of her business is that she takes reservations during the day in order to fulfill them on the weekends, and the disadvantage is that she has to close her store on the weekends to take care of the decorating.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to expand her store and keep it open even on the weekends.  She is requesting a loan to buy a 6-tray oven to make wedding cakes and cookies for children's birthdays and christenings to improve her business.  This is her first cycle of loans with the institution in the year that she has been doing this business.

He is married to Rustic, is self-employed, and has one child in high school. He works hard to provide for his family and to send his child to school.\r\n\r\nEduardo owns and operates his own jeepney transportation service. He has one jeepney (14-16 person capacity). Jeepneys are the most common and cheapest form of public transportation throughout the many islands of the Philippines. They are one of the remnants of the American military presence in the Philippines during the Second World War and are still to be seen throughout the country, in many colors and all over the place. The Filipinos, being creative, saw the possibility to turn these vehicles into a real form of transportation by making them about two meters longer and by putting in two long seats, one on each side, from the front to the back. Since then, jeepneys have been used as small buses for the cheap transportation of people, goods, and sometimes even little animals.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operating his business, Eduardo is requesting a loan of 40,000 Philippine pesos (PHP), which he will use for the maintenance and registration of his jeepney. It is very important that his unit always be in good running condition to ensure efficient service. He thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that he will receive.\r\n\r\nEduardo hopes to buy another jeepney unit. He dreams of giving his child the best education. He prays for his and his passengers' safety in every trip. Every week, he faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members* to share stories of his work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which he studies. \r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Guluila has secondary education. Together with her spouse, she works in animal husbandry and agriculture. \r\n\r\nThanks to Guluipa's persistent hard work, today the farm has two cows and a horse. She also owns 1.04 hectares and rents 0.40 hectares of irrigated land.

Meet Bramwel, a youthful, 29-year-old honest man, who is a father to three good-looking children. He is based in Kaplamai, a remote village in the Kitale area of Kenya. This is an area with high poultry production and consumption. \r\n\r\nFor three years, Bramwel has been actively involved in mixed farming as a source of income. He has a beautiful and supportive wife, who helps him with farm work and domestic chores. His primary sources of income are milk, crops, and some personal business that he does to make ends meet. He passionately loves poultry farming, and this can be noticed in how he takes good care of his poultry birds and feeds them. When he was asked what he enjoys about poultry farming, he replied that he enjoys \u201cpicking up the eggs every day in the morning.\u201d \r\n\r\nHowever, this humble and honest man faces challenges of not meeting the demand for eggs, and not satisfying his ever-increasing client base. That is why he is requesting a loan: to buy good quality breeds of poultry birds. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture, and the demand for chicken is always high, because it is such a popular meal for so many people. In addition to earning increased profits, Bramwel will benefit from poultry manure, which will save him some money that he otherwise would have used to buy fertilizer. With the increased income from selling eggs, poultry meat, and feathers, he will permanently change his living conditions and secure the future of his school-going children.\r\n\r\nKindly help him out!\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1863571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry birds of a high-quality breed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-27T12:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-27T12:10:08Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bramwel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.34},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":873228,"name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Isab est une femme d\u2019affaires et propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un cabinet de change de la monnaie dans un rond point ville depuis 11 ans, membre du groupe de cr\u00e9dits \u00abJ\u00e9r\u00e9mie\u00bb, cliente de l\u2019IMF Hekima, mari\u00e9e, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 45 ans, m\u00e8re de 8 enfants tous vont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole.

The older one is in school. His wife is an auditor. Jonathan is a civil engineer and is carrying out jobs for the state, but since he hasn't had much practice, he needs a lot of tools so that his builders can do their work more quickly and efficiently.  \r\n\r\nHe will also use the loan to buy cement, sand and other materials that he uses in the completion of his jobs, because sometimes the money advances for the work are not enough to continue with the jobs, and thanks to the loans he can finish the jobs on time. There are various people that work with him and just like him they can make a living. \r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy tools and construction materials. He has done 3 loan cycles with the Grupo de Cr\u00e9dito and he thanks them for the quickness and low interests of the loans. His dream is to have a big construction company.
