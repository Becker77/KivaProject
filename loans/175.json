That is why she enjoys being a part of it.\r\n\r\nThis, her 4th loan, will be used as additional capital for her sari-sari (variety) store. She will buy different groceries and many other items that are needed for her business. Sari-sari stores basically sell small quantities of various foodstuffs, grocery items and beverages. Such stores are convenient for people in the village who live far from the market place.\r\n\r\nJane Pearl\u2019s business has been very helpful in achieving her family's dreams. Her greatest hope is that her family will be able to have a good life, as it currently lives in poverty. Her long term goals are to invest and build a better house for the family and to have a full-fledged mini-grocery

Elvia is the mother of three children who are all adults now; they sometimes help her out economically.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

E. \r\n\r\nMy family and I had to leave the town where we lived, San Sami\u00e1n \u2013 Huarochir\u00ed.  We had to go to Lima due to a work proposal my husband received.  Unfortunately, he suffered an accident in transit.  He could not keep working as a bricklayer for one year.  \r\n\r\nAt the root of this situation, I see myself in the necessity of working for my family.  I had to go up and down the streets with my two small children knocking door to door selling food and fruit.  I also washed clothes and helped cook in popular dining rooms to survive and not leave my family abandoned.  Even so, these earnings did not cover the expenses that we had.  \r\n\r\nI soon came to learn from a nephew who participates in EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD about the loans they give to people like me, entrepreneurs.  I realized that this was the opportunity that I was looking for to progress economically.  That is how I became part of the Luz D. San Antonio Community Bank.  I am currently the president.  Thirteen people participate.  We work in businesses.\r\n\r\nWith my first loan that I got from EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD, I could buy merchandise like flowers, medicinal plants, and natural medicines.

She is 30 years old and she is living with their two children in their village in Punit Benito Soliven, Isabela. Her husband Luisito is currently working in another country as a Project Engineer.  Their two children are Michael Angelo, eight years old, and Darlene Gaile, one year old. The couple sacrifices by being away from each other just to meet the daily needs and future welfare of their children who have growing needs. Jennifer hopes that someday, they will be able to send their two children to school and see them earn their degrees in college.<P>\r\n\r\nJennifer retails cell phone loads for Smart and Globe subscribers.  Her customers usually buy their load by sending a text message and she will also send the load through a text.  She ventured into this business so she can  help her husband in supporting the needs of their family.  She is requesting a loan amounting to PHP 4,000 from KIVA lenders to be used as additional capital.  Electronic loading is very much in demand in their village and Jennifer wants to maximize her loan and be productive in the business. She hopes that her business will be supported by KIVA lenders.

She is 27 years old, married, and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Roselyn owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Roselyn has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Roselyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Roselyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from GDMPC. Roselyn is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Roselyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the her children and to cover daily expenses. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

For the last 12 years she has devoted herself to selling second hand clothes that she acquires from the capital city.  To get the bags of clothing, she travels to Lima every 15 days and on some occasions she has her merchandise sent to her. Her best sales take place during commercial markets and during festivals in rural areas of her locality. In their spare time, her husband and her oldest daughter help transport the merchandise.  For Gaudecia, this work has allowed her to have the necessary earnings to support her family, and adds to the money her husband.  For the future, she wishes to have a more permanent stall where she can conduct her sales more comfortably and with higher frequency.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that she has a loan with MFP and is happy to have a boost in her capital to improve her business.  With the money, she will buy more clothes to increase her sales. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Colleen  Godfrey, Kiva

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 48 years old, married to Sr. Anselmo Clemente, and has eight children.  Trinidad and Mar\u00eda Elena are the only children still in school, a first year high school student and a fifth graD. student respectively.  The others are married.  Crecencia sells soft drinks, which she has been doing for three years.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe chose this business activity because she wanted to find a way to move her children forward and help her husband with the household expenses.  For this reason, she decided to start a small business and now she says she generates good earnings.  The loan she will receive will be invested in the purchase of more merchandise such as soft drinks, water, and juices.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Crecencia says that her plan is to continue investing in her business so that it will grow even more.  She wants to establish a grocery store so that she can improve and increase her income to help cover her children\u2019s educational expenses.

These sales enable her to cover the cost of her weekly food and some other incidental expenses.\r\n\r\nDedicaci\u00f3n is grateful to God for all the support that she has received and, in spite of how demanding it is working on her farm, she is happy that she owns her farm and is able to work it for her children.\r\n\r\nDedicaci\u00f3n belongs to the \"Mirando a un futuro mejor\" community bank and this is her 12th loan from MFP.  She will continue working for the development of her bank.  As a long-standing member of her bank, Dedicaci\u00f3n pledges to be punctual in making her loan repayments.

very hardworking, responsible women who all live in different places but the group members meet in Socorro\u2019s house because due to health issues she\u2019s unable to go out; she can\u2019t walk because the doctors have recommended that she rest for two months so the group members will meet in her house.  The place where she lives is on a little hill where every morning the sun arrives first, this is what Socorro relates.\r\n\r\nThe group is called \u201cEspuma de Mar\u201d (Sea Foam).  They chose this name because it occured to them and also because it\u2019s been used in other communal banks.  \r\n\r\nCaro, 28, is the group representative.  She\u2019s married to Gustavo who works as a cashier and they have two children: Jaime, 9, attending fourth grade in elementary school and Leslie, 4, in second grade of preschool.\r\n\r\nCaro raises chickens that she buys when they are little and then sells when they are big.  She comments that she\u2019s been in this business four years and has no great difficulty except when they become ill but if that happens Caro takes them to the veterinarian so there\u2019s no big problem.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion she\u2019s asked for the loan to buy 150 chicks, corn and feed.  Her goal for the chicks she\u2019ll soon buy is that they grow soon so that she can sell them within three months to help her husband with schooling and household expenses.  She also wants to save up some money so that when her husband is out of work they will still be able to eat.  She comments: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult when my husband, Gustavo, isn\u2019t working because we don\u2019t have what\u2019s needed to cover our children\u2019s basic needs like food, shoes, school supplies.  That\u2019s why I and the other group members are very grateful for the loan we are being granted.  This is our first time and we don\u2019t intend to disappoint, especially me who as group representative must set the example.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other group members will use the loan for other activities like:  Francisca, Juana and Socorro will buy chicks to raise and later sell; Maribel will buy underwear; Cinthya will invest in catalogue comforters and fragrances and finally, Brisa will invest in her bedspread and shoe business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":918126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 150 chicks, feed and corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-11-30T01:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cintia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":937.5,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":13145.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250785118},{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":6572.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193681},{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6572.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330042}],"funded_date":"2011-11-30T17:42:27Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":369501,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is a married woman with two children; one attends school.

She is married to Roberto, a craftsman and father of their two children.  Wilson is 26 years old, and Neri is 19 years old.  She lives with her husband, her children, and two grandchildren in her own house.\n\nElena\u2019s business is selling general groceries.  She opened a grocery store in her house in order to do this.  She also sells yuccas, and she kindly tends to her customers.  She started with financial support from MFP.  She purchased in small quantities, and she managed to grow from the foundation of hard work.  Over the time that she had her business she worked alone.  However, starting over six month ago she counts on her son\u2019s help in waiting on the public.\n\nShe considers her business to be profitable because of the income it gives her, and because she has a regular clientele.  Her business allows her to be at home in order to be able to tend to her young child.  The financial income serves her to buy what she needs for her household.  On the other hand, she does not like that some of her customers ask for credit.  When it comes time to pay they put it off.  Even so, she sees that her business is well-received.  Therefore, she wishes to grow and expand her grocery store until she can convert it into a bazaar where she will be able to sell all types of products.\n\nThis will be her third loan with MFP.  She hopes for your collaboration so that she will be able to firm up her plans.  Also, she feels good with her communal bank.  She knows most of them, and new members are joining.  She hopes they will be as responsible as the rest of the group.  She will use the requested 2000 soles to buy wholesale groceries like sugar, rice, oil, and others for her grocery store.  She will also buy yuccas because the prices for this product are rising, which leaves her with greater income.\n\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1050623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy sugar, rice, oil, and yucca.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":302.15},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":299.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":330.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":344.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":350.99},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":372.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.37},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":509055,"name":"Copaboka 1 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame V\u00e9ronique, membre du groupe COPABOKA 1, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 54 ans, cultivatrice du riz,  a 10 enfants dont le plus \u00e2g\u00e9 a 30 ans et le moins \u00e2g\u00e9 a 8 ans. 8 de ses enfants vont \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole et n'a aucune autre personne en sa charge.

has a small plot of land that she bought about 30 years ago. She lives on the land with her son and his family of three children. They primarily plant rice, but also raise chickens and pigs as a secondary source of income. She hopes to invest the money in making her production greater by buying fertilizer. With her extra income she also wants to help her grandchildren go to school and hopefully make more investments in her land. \r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":25838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-11T00:05:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-25T08:36:05Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":113,"local_amount":113,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T09:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21413},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T19:38:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T09:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31799},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-08-20T18:26:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T09:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44801},{"amount":313,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:50:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T09:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":313,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107757},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-05-13T16:13:44Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T09:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":209418}],"funded_date":"2007-04-11T08:36:05Z","paid_date":"2008-05-13T16:13:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12159,"name":"Ruslan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A.

With the most recent loan from Manuela Ramos, which she will fulfill in 6 payments, she will purchase bulk beans, banana clusters, bulk honey, and large quantities of regional fruits, including papaya, coconut, noni, along with other products that she has needed to purchase almost daily, including long coriander, green onions, Chinese cabbage, lettuce, avocados, yucca, etc. To maintain her clientele, she makes sure that her stand is in order and that the product that she offers is fresh. She has 6 children and is 61 years old. Nearly all of her children anre independent now, and she now only supports the youngest. She enjoys her daily activities in her home, and her work in market, now that she has established a strong clientele by offering quality products.

She is 41 years old. Celita is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Celita owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Celita has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Celita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Celita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Celita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Celita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sattorkul is a 52-year-old farmer, who lives with his wife and four children in the northern part of Tajikistan, in the Shahristan region.

Milk products are in great demand in his village and Sattorkul\u2019s orders for them are very high.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At this occupation she works on the weekdays but on the weekends she runs their restaurant where they serve a lengthy menu, especially using pork meat. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of the community bank for 3 years, though she took a leave of absence. She is on her second loan cycle. She very much enjoys working with the community bank because she gets to collaborate with her friends. The loan will be invested in the purchase of more livestock. Her goal is to make her businesses grow.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":582607,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-08-13T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Florinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166847074},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113530},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407220},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407221},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388309},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388310},{"amount":165,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:54Z","rounded_local_amount":165,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682807}],"funded_date":"2010-08-15T14:48:45Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":226056,"name":"Sroin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sroin K.

Camburong, Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a pig fattening and motorcycle business. Her husband, Onesimo B., who is 54 years old, works as a driver to earn his living. They have six children who are between 11 and 30 years old. One of them has a family, while three others are working to help out in the house, and the youngest two go to school. Marcelina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. Marcelina B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marcelina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus improving the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her ninth loan, she wants to borrow PHP 15,000 to use as additional capital for the business so that she can continue to save up for the future and support the family's needs. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She started her business in 2006 and has since gained much experience. Today, her working capital exceeds 600,000 Mongolian tugriks (MNT). In addition, she plants and grows a variety of vegetables to sell at the local market for a profit. \r\n\r\nFor the future, she plans to increase her working capital for her meat-trading business and enlarge the field where she plants her vegetables in order to increase her vegetable sales. With her business earnings, she was able to afford to buy her own house with fence. \r\n\r\nEnhtuya is a hardworking and modest person and is requesting a 700,000 MNT loan to purchase and preserve a large amount of meat in order to sell it during the spring months, when prices for such products traditionally rise.

What Blas most enjoys is going out every morning with his radio and watering and fertilizing his crops to the rhythm of the music.  He says \"the countryside is my life\".  As a boy, Blas grew up learning how to grow crops and this is all he learned.  Every harvest is a symbol of his perseverance and the attention that he has given his crops.  Blas owns farmland in different places in town which means that he grows in large quantities.  In the wholesale market in his town, Blas not only sells his harvested crops but also the meat from the sheep that he raises.  However, unlike others in his town, he also sells the wool of these animals which is very thick and provides protection from the cold.  Blas would like to buy a truck so that he can transport the crops and animals that he sells more easily.\r\n\r\nBlas is a member of the \"Mirando a un futuro mejor\" community bank and this is his eighth loan from MFP.

All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n\r\n<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":25862,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-14T01:48:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-30T21:36:38Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21428},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T22:38:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31813},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:14:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51885},{"amount":912,"local_amount":912,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T22:11:39Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":912,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107773}],"funded_date":"2007-04-16T21:36:38Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T22:11:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12175,"name":"Sabir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M.

With a little more effort and dedication Gustavo dreams of seeing his small dining room become a successful restaurant that his son can take over after finishing his university studies.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Debra Faszer-McMahon, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nEl se\u00f1or Gustavo  G. es un hombre trabajador y esforzado de 53 a\u00f1os de edad que habita en Batahola Norte junto a su esposa y un solo hijo de 16 a\u00f1os de edad a quien le ha ense\u00f1ado desde peque\u00f1o el valor del trabajo, amor al estudio y valores familiares.

He dreams of adding another taxi unit to his business, and of leaving this business to his son, who would benefit in the future, even though it would be an investment for him and his family.  Juan\u2019s son dreams of having his own taxi business; then Juan could stop working, since he is very tired by his age \u2013 this is their biggest dream.\r\n\tJuan runs a taxi service.  His business travels, because he must drive around the streets looking for passengers.  Juan has had this business for fifteen years.

What follows are details of the activities they have achieved.  \r\n\r\nMs. LEYLA DEL CARMEN M. has been selling cosmetics for four years. She carries out the majority of those sells on the street. Leyla decided to go into business to support her companion in covering some of their family expenses. Leyla lives with her partner and has 3 children who depend on her. Her fiance works in agriculture and works as a laborer in the fields. \r\n\r\nMrs. NEYBI SOFIA R. O. has been selling cosmetics for 1 year.

Her companion had to immigrate to the USA in search of a better living, and up until now he has achieved it. With the earnings he sends home to her, she has been able to invest in improving their living conditions. From the earnings her business has generated, she is able to cover 100% of her personal expenses. \r\n\r\nMrs. JULIA AMPARO O. has been selling food for 8 years. Her regular clients are policemen. Julia made the decision to do this business because next to her house is a dining room open to everyone. But 8 years ago this business was closed and a lot of people had been going there to eat regularly. This made putting the business there a good idea since she practically had permanent customers. Since that time, Mrs. Julia has been selling food to the policemen. She is married and her husband works in agriculture. Their four at-home daughters also work to prepare the meals.\r\n\r\nMrs. YOLANDA MARIBEL M. has been selling bread and candy for 4 years. Yolanda bakes twice a week and sells her candy on Sundays. She\u2019s sells the candy at the soccer fields. She is a mother of 3 children who depend on her 100%. Her husband works in the fields.

To make a living, Vevencia owns & operates a retail store selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Vevencia has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Vevencia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vevencia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Vevencia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units with offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":402515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Liloan Bonifacio Mis.

He is 43 years old and married with three school-aged children. To make a living, Hilario owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Hilario has been engaged in his business for over ten years and earns approximately $338 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Hilario joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. Hilario has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Hilario is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be his 16th loan from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

In addition, Ver\u00f3nika manufactures some of the outfits that she sells from her stand.  What she enjoys most about her job is giving advice to the young girls who buy from her.  She has been in this business for three years and says the hardest part is transporting her inventory because the trip is long and tiring.  In the future, she hopes to have a larger shop where she can provide better service to her customers.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Ver\u00f3nika\u2019s first loan with MFP.  At such a young age, she is very responsible at her job.  She knows she has to make her payments on time.  Ver\u00f3nika is well-liked by the other members of her Communal Bank for her cheerful disposition and because she is the youngest member of the group.  With her loan of 1000 soles, she plans to buy material for producing more dresses to sell so that she can offer her customers a wider variety.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":469003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase material for making dresses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-15T03:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":169.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124437},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":169.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960178},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:53Z","rounded_local_amount":169.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993022},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":169.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717808},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":169.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751483},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":167.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933950}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T16:03:04Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":172267,"name":"Diego","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"39-year-old Diego T. is a fisherman and at the same time a fish vendor in Talibon Bohol.

They all live in N'Gama village in Segou, the fourth largest administrative building in Mali, and met each other through family and friends; they cultivate peanuts, millet and rice. \r\nIn order to enlarge their rice fields they are seeking a second loan from Soro Yiriwaso. \r\nMadame Bassouma D. aims to use her loan both to purchase three bags of complex cereals and to hire some staff in order to cultivate, pick and hoe the rice fields. \r\nIn N'Gama village, labour and picking the fields is generally men's work, whereas weeding the rice is done by women's associations in the village. Bassouma D. sources her fertiliser from wholesalers at the Konodimini market. She aims to utilise her 2 hectar land in order to generate 20 bags of rice. Part of the harvest is consumed by those involved in its production, and the rest is sold. The profits generated are used to meet family needs.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":566356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase fertiliser and employ labour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"N'Gama","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Banah               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mah                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chiya               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manh            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bassouma        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nako               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natassou         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soungou           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":607210.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606184}],"funded_date":"2010-08-02T01:58:34Z","paid_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Danielle Treharne","image":null}},{"id":217879,"name":"Aba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aba E. is a fish monger from Abura.

She is now requesting a new loan to purchase additional fishing nets and fish cages (traps) and hopes to increase the amount of fish she can sell in the future through hard work and the continuing assistance of  Kiva Partner ASHI. <p>\r\n\r\nMaxima's membership in ASHI  gave her the chance to have her own business. Because of her excellent credit performance throughout her membership in ASHI, from an initial loan of Php5,000 she can now avail Php40,000.00 and could even reach the peak amount available in the future.  Therefore, Maxima looks forward to continued business growth through both the loans and the help of her supportive husband, Mamerto, who is her business partner. <p>\r\n\r\nWhen she reaches the highest loan amount that ASHI can offer, she plans to rent a space in the market where she can sell their fish. With the opportunity provided by her membership in ASHI, Maxima can help send their three children to school until they complete college degrees. The couple believes that when they pass away, they will at least have made their business successful and their children can have a business.

Through the poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

The couple have four children and live together in Sivia district, where they have their own house.\r\n\r\nV\u00edctor is a man of many projects.  One of these projects is growing cacao plants, an activity that he carries out together with his wife.  As this business was becoming established, he started producing grafted cacao plants which can be harvested in less time and provide an optimal yield.  However, he also plans to grow other crops.  He gets up very early to prepare the land that still has nothing growing in it.  Generally, he has the help of his family when he needs to pick his cacao, for which there is great demand both at home and abroad, particularly for organic cacao which V\u00edctor knows how to grow and for which he receives a good price per kilo.  In the near future, V\u00edctor would like to stock his [plant] nursery for grafting cacao.\r\n\r\nThis will be V\u00edctor's first loan from MFP and he pledges to make his repayments on time.  He will use his 1,500 soles to buy more cacao plants to sow on his land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":899649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cacao plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-20T11:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1564.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098793}],"funded_date":"2011-10-22T07:59:11Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":353144,"name":"Afiwavi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Afiwavi est une femme \u00e2g\u00e9e de 23 ans.

It takes an average of four boxes to embroider one blouse. She expects that with this loan she will be able to embroider 175 blouses.<p>\r\nIn addition to the fact that these clients know their businesses well, they would like to acquire new skills in different areas. For example, some would like to learn English, others would like to learn baking, while others would like to learn more about medicine.<p>\r\nThe dream of each of the members is to get out of poverty. They simply want to escape from the clutches of a reality that does not allow them to develop to their full potential in different areas of their lives. It is important that we continue to support them so that this simple dream can become a simple reality, so that they can get ahead in life and combat the status quo. <p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <p><\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Las se\u00f1oras que integran el banco comunal \u201cBordadora Flora\u201d llegaron a la oficina de Friendship Bridge en el distrito de Nahuala a tiempo diez minutos antes de que la reuni\u00f3n empiece, las integrantes ubicaron los bancos de pl\u00e1stico en forma de una \u201cU\u201d y le avisaron a la facilitadota que ya estaban listas para empezar. \r\n\r\n<P>Estas clientas pueden sorprender a cualquier, ya que la chispa que tienen en los ojos es inusual en muchas mujeres que viven en comunidades retiradas como las de El Novillero, que est\u00e1 ubicada en un \u00e1rea rural y muy pobre. \r\n\r\n<P>Todas las integrantes son bordadoras conocidas en sus  aldeas. La actividad principal de las Bordadoras Flora es el de bordar bell\u00edsimas blusas tradicionales. Los colores principales de estas blusas son lilas, celestes, corinto y morado. La combinaci\u00f3n de colores entre los bordados y el color de la blusa es incre\u00edble. Estas blusas cuando son usadas por las mujeres colorean y avivan las calles de El Novillero. \r\n\r\n<P>Sin embargo, cuatro clientas tienen m\u00e1s de un negocio. Estas clientas tienen un negocio respectivo en las \u00e1reas de compra y venta de ropa, cafeter\u00eda, tienda de consumo diario y venta de ropa t\u00edpica.  \r\n\r\n<P>Marta Tzco coment\u00f3 que iba a usar su pr\u00e9stamo para comprar una refrigeradora para su cafeter\u00eda. La refrigeradora cuesta $US720 y ella la va a comprar con las ganancias de los meses pasados m\u00e1s su pr\u00e9stamo. Julia E. dijo que ella iba a utilizar su pr\u00e9stamo para comprar aproximada 700 cajas de hilo. Una blusa se puede bordar en promedio con cuatro cajas. Ella proyecta que con ese pr\u00e9stamo va a poder bordar 175 blusas. \r\n\r\n<P>Adem\u00e1s de que est\u00e1s clientas conocen bien su negocio, ellas quieren adquirir nuevos conocimientos en distintas \u00e1reas. Por ejemplo, algunas quisieran aprender a hablar ingl\u00e9s, otras reposter\u00eda, mientras que otras les gustar\u00eda aprender m\u00e1s sobre medicina. \r\n\r\n<P>El sue\u00f1o de todas las integrantes es salir de la pobreza. Simplemente quieren escapar de las garras de una realidad que no las deja desenvolverse a plenitud en distintos rubros de sus vidas. Es importante que sigamos apoy\u00e1ndolas para que este simple sue\u00f1o se vuelva en una simple realidad, salir adelante en la vida combatiendo el status quo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":139973,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy thread for embroidery;

A. is forty years old. She is married and is the mother of six children. Two of her children have completed senior high school, while the rest are currently in junior and primary schools. <p>\r\nShe is a local manufacturer of palm kernel oil, which is produced from palm kernel and is used to prepare many local dishes like fried fish and pastries. Indeed, she produces and supplies her oil to food vendors so that they can prepare their meals. Although palm kernel oil production is one of the most common occupations among local women in the town of Obuasi, it is nonetheless a lucrative business to be in. However, her oil production has been on the decline in recent months by virtue of the fact that she has very little working capital in order to afford a machine to process the oil. Therefore, she is seeking a loan to buy seventy bags of palm kernel and an electric milling machine to both reduce the need for manual labor in the production process and to produce oil in larger quantities. Ultimately, she feels that this loan will enable her to generate more income to thereby provide food her family and finance her children\u2019s education. <p>\r\nSalamatu belongs to the community group called \u201cMegyefo Tease\u201d (My Redeemer Lives) Trust Group.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more banana in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:40:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary A.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T20:12:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356213},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347955},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970529},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886746},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436006}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T20:12:00Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65451,"name":"Zulfiya","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0421\u0430\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0417\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0431. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442 28 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c.\u0417\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0441 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0438-\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438.\u041a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043c  \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f.\u0428\u044c\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0437, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435  \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445  \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0430\u0445.\u0418\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435\u0435 2 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041d\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044c.\u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u0442\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 12\u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0435\u0432.","en":"Zulfiya S. resides in the city of Kulob.

They have many clients.  In season they sew to order and in the winter they purchase fabric pieces and sew dresses and trousers, which are purchased by sellers from the \u201cKorvon\u201d market for resale.  Nilufar sews dresses from different fabrics and in different styles (pitcher, flower, cotton, heart).  \r\n\r\nDuring wedding season demand increases for a variety of traditional dresses.  At these times the client needs additional resources to purchase fabric and accessories.

Mrs. Bunthy S. is the 50- year-old village bank president. She is a farmer who owns a piece of land to grow mangoes. Now she has an obstacle because her field is infertile and has suffered insect damage. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer and pesticides to enable her mangoe production to be better. She hopes to increase her income and production. Her husband, Mr. Nouv Sam Oul, is a teacher in the local school. They have a child who is employed in a garment factory.

The members with EoT loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. EoT loans allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

She is married and is a mother of 5 children.  She sells children's toys at the Central market of the Jabbor-Rasulov district.  Muhabbat buys her merchandise at a wholesale market in the city of Istaravshan.  She goes there twice per month.  Her husband, Abdusattor Gafurov, is a master builder.

refurbish part of her beauty salon in Long Island City. She used the money to install a new beauty station and buy another hairdryer chair.\n\nWhen borrowers pay down 40% of their loans with ACCION USA, they are eligible to refinance for more funds. In April, when Elizabeth had paid down about 60% of her loan, she came to us to refinance in order to make further improvements to her salon. \n\nWith her loan, Elizabeth will refurbish the tile flooring in her salon and to buy additional dryers. Elizabeth will be able to continue strengthening her credit and making her salon more welcoming and professional-looking to customers. Ultimately, she hopes this renovation of her business space leads to a more profitable business to support her and her husband and children.\n\n\n About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\n\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":8675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8675,"image":{"id":547651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

","en":"This group is named \"Meloma\". It is made up of 8 very hard working women who live in the community of San Francisco La Loma. This community belongs to the municipality of San Jose del Rincon in Mexico. San Francisco La Loma's population consists of families who are agriculturists and farmers. There are also merchants who have general stores or those who travel to the various plazas to sell their products, such as plastics, belts, and clothing.\r\n\r\nThe group \"Meloma\" is not different from other group because the 8 members are house wives who have a business on the side. The women of the group are the following: \r\n\r\n1.-Francisca C. M.: she is 45 years old and she is a merchant who sells clothing for the entire family in the plazas.\r\n2.-Maria Guadalupe M. M.: she is 41 years old, she is a house wife, and she raises chickens which she later sells. \r\n3.-Maria Guadalupe R. R.: she is 73 years old and she raises livestock. Currently she raises pigs.\r\n4. - Jovita M. S.: she is 50 years old and she has a convenience store.\r\n5.-Maria del Carmen T. R.: She is 47 years old and she has a convenience store.\r\n6.-Isidra T. D.: She is 44 years old and she raises chickens which she later sells.\r\n7.-Maria Luisa R. R.: she is 26 years old, the youngest in the group, had she also goes out to the plazas to sell clothing\r\n8.-Margarita C. M.: she is 47 years old and she is the leader of the group. She raises livestock. Usually she raises sheep and chickens.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group know each other since they were children. They decided on the name \"Meloma\" because it is the nickname of the community: San Francisco de la Loma is \"Meloma\".\r\n\r\nIt should also be mentioned that the community is Mazahua, meaning that the majority of the adult population speak this dialect. But the kids have stopped learning the language, which is why the primary schools are trying to bring back the language so that it will not be lost. Language class is one of the courses kids take in school.\r\n\r\nMargarita, who they affectionately cal Mago, is a Mazahua. She is married and she has 11 children. She has been married for 33 years. She lives in her own home and she lives together with her husband. Of the 11 children, 2 passed away so she only has 9 left; four are girls and 5 are boys. \r\n\r\nThere are two that depend on Mago. Her 11-year old son is in grade 5 and she has a 4-year old granddaughter. They are her two last dependents. Mago's husband is an agriculturist. He doesn't have a steady job but whenever a construction job becomes available he takes it to have more money. \r\n\r\nIt should also be mentioned that Mago is a leader in her community. There are people that follow her and support her in the decisions that she takes. \r\n\r\nFor the most part the population is made up of simple and humble individuals with integrity and they support each other as needed.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":666049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. was born in 1968. Married and the mother of two (2) children, she also has charge of her sick mother. For that last 8 years, she has operated a business producing and selling palm oil - a very popular oil used for cooking in her town. This has allowed her to contribute to running of her household with her modest income.  The production and stocking of palm oil requires enough money. It is necessary to first buy the palm nuts before making the oil. This preparation also requires wood for burning and a lot of care and precision. It is meticulous work. To store the oil, one needs to buy drums. Palm oil is a much loved part of Togolese cuisine and her business is flourishing. Mrs A. A. is asking for a loan of $600 to improve her production and satisfy her ever increasing clientele.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Susan Bell, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMadame A. A.

Depuis 8 ans, elle exerce le commerce d\u2019huile de palme (huile tr\u00e8s utilis\u00e9e pour la cuisine dans sa localit\u00e9). Ce qui lui permet de contribuer aux charges du m\u00e9nage avec son revenu, aussi modeste soit-il.  La production et le stockage d\u2019huile de palme n\u00e9cessitent assez de fonds. Il faut d\u2019abord s\u2019approvisionner en noix de palme avant de faire la pr\u00e9paration. Cette pr\u00e9paration n\u00e9cessite \u00e9galement de bois de chauffe et se fait avec beaucoup de soins et de pr\u00e9cision. C\u2019est un travail m\u00e9ticuleux. Pour le stockage, il faut des bidons qu\u2019il faut aussi acqu\u00e9rir.

She has two children who are already grown up, but still live with her and help out on the farm. They have a few chickens and pigs that are their secondary sources of income. Angela hopes to invest the loan in a water pump so she may access water for her crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":25956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Angela hopes to invest in a water pump to water her rice crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T20:32:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-25T22:22:03Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-06-18T09:15:19Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-20T03:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23989},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-07-18T09:15:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-20T03:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33164},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-08-18T09:15:13Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-20T03:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":43865},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-09-18T09:15:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-20T03:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":55854},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-10-18T09:15:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-20T03:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":68796},{"amount":90,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2007-11-18T10:15:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-20T03:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82913}],"funded_date":"2007-04-11T22:22:03Z","paid_date":"2007-11-18T10:15:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12207,"name":"Jose Patrocinio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"My name is Jos\u00e9 G..

Her well-tanned skin is a reflection of the work she does on the farm, work that she does happily, side-by-side with her husband.

They generally do this work during the harvest season.  This year, though, they're cultivating their own crop, planting potatoes and peas in a field owned by in-laws, as well as land that they've rented, with a goal of turning the crop into an income and buying their own land in the future.

","en":"Gabriela M. Mujica is 28 years old and she is originally from the region of San Jose Purua in the state of Michoacan. It is a beautiful region known for its hot thermal springs. Gaby, as she is known to her friends and neighbors, studied to be a nursing assistant, but she didn't complete her training because she married very young and her husband did not let her keep going. They had already had their first child and it was too difficult to cover the tuition and pay for the baby's expenses. Gaby, as she likes to be called, sells beauty products and household items through a catalogue. She has been in the business for four years and she started out to help her husband with the household expenses. She goes out to sell to the teachers in various schools and to her neighbors. She has this business thanks to her mother-in-law because she was the one who encouraged her to work in the sale of products through catalogues. Gaby requests a loan from Fundacion (Kiva Field Partner) in order to invest in the purchase of beauty products and household products. She is married to Ernesto, a day laborer.

For Geraldine L., 35, each thread is valuable as it makes her and her family's lives worth living. Aside from being a micro-entrepreneur, Geraldine is also a wife to Samuel, a car air conditioner technician, and a mother to three children, one of whom is in high school while the other two go to elementary school. Their family lives in Dasmarinas, Cavite. \r\n\r\nDoormat making is Geraldine's main business. She uses scrap cloth to produce beautiful doormats that are sold at prices afforded by her fellow community members. Geraldine has been operating this business for three years now in their home in Dasmarinas. \r\n\r\nOther than doormat making, she is also into direct selling. She brings with her catalogs of the apparel brand Board Walk and other beauty brands, gets orders from customers in the neighborhood, purchases the orders, and delivers the products to the customers. She earns profits out of the commission. Summing it all up, Geraldine earns a net income of 7,900 Philippine pesos (PHP) every month. \r\n\r\nTo help her grow her doormat making business, Geraldine decides to loan an amount of 14,000 PHP. She believes that with the entrepreneurial training and spiritual support CCT* gives her, she will be able to channel the loan into appropriate business measures and increase her income. She plans to purchase more cloth in order to be able to produce more doormats. Part of the loan will also go to purchasing more Board Walk products for her direct selling business. \r\n\r\nGiven the challenges Geraldine refuses to specifically mention, she then focuses on making the golden threads and the burlap of her life come together to produce a majestic fabric, the fulfillment of her dreams.
