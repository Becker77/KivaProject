To help expand her business, Justine has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more charcoal, and will help Justine to generate greater profits and educate her children. Justine hopes that in the future she will be able to improve her business. \r\n\r\nJustine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

He lives in Thika, a small remote rural town in Kenya that has bad terrain and is characterized by drought and bad weather conditions. For the past 10 years, Harrison has been actively involved in mixed farming. His primary source of income is from milk and crop farming. Harrison loves dairy farming and has nicknamed one of his cows. Milking his cow is his hobby and feeding his cows makes him very proud. Dairy farming is very fulfilling for Harrison. He faces the challenge of irrigating his farm and providing water to his animals. Thika is a remote area without piped water or electricity. Since Harrison is from a marginalized community, he is forced to walk long distances to search for water. He typically walks for two hours. Therefore, Harrison is requesting a loan, which he will use to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the rain water in his area goes to waste and Harrison wants to harvest the water and store it in a water tank. The loan will save Harrison time and allow him to irrigate his farm during dry seasons and increase his productivity. The increase in productivity will translate into more income, which will provide him with financial security. Harrison will also use the stored water for home consumption. Harrison\u2019s dream is to increase his farming activities and provide his children with a proper education. Education is the only way that his children, who are from a marginalized community, can succeed."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":129.58,"image":{"id":1863670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a water tank and water pipes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Thika","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-27T14:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-27T14:50:06Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.01,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Harrison","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1769.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1821.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1874.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1929},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1985.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2043.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2103.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2164.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2227.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2292.98},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2359.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2428.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.62},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.81},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.51},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.96},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.57,"local_amount":3960.96,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4087.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460179},{"amount":41.75,"local_amount":3795.65,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3917.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588334},{"amount":44.25,"local_amount":4023.24,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4151.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.01,"payment_id":731023441}],"funded_date":"2015-04-29T21:34:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kristin Simpson","image":null}},{"id":871669,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL ES UN PADRE DE FAMILIA QUE TIENE PROBLEMAS VISUALES AL IGUAL QUE SU ESPOSA, ELLA SE ENCARGA DEL CUIDADO DE SUS HIJOS PERO EN LOS \u00daLTIMOS MESES SE LE HA COMPLICAOD AYUDARLES HASTA CON SUS TAREAS DE LA ESCUELA POR ESTE PROBLEMA.

Kenya. The 24-year-old farmer mainly practices dairy farming and milk is his main source of income. \r\n\r\nIn a bid to grow his business, Geoffrey is seeking a KES 20,000 loan from Kiva lenders.

For the past year, Victoria has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells soft drinks. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Victoria has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more water, soda, and juice, and will help Victoria to generate greater profits and provide for the family. Victoria hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business. \r\n\r\nVictoria is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She is married and has one child. For the past 4 years, Mastula has been working hard to manage her Pharmacy shop to sell drugs. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mastula has requested a loan of 950,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more drugs, and will help Mastula to generate greater profits and increase  the business. Mastula hopes that in the future she will be able to own a clinic. \r\n\r\nMastula is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past 4 years, Topista has worked hard to manage her sponge business. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Topista has requested a loan of 950,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more sponges and will help Topista to generate greater profits and expand the business. Topista hopes that in the future she will be able to improve on the business. \r\n\r\nTopista is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Sherah hopes that in the future she will be able to return to school. \r\n\r\nSherah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to invest in a business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Josephine\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 10.5 acres of land and purchase a total of four solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1803201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-27T16:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-27T16:30:11Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Parthew","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cheketi C","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter N","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belisila Lihavi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felisters","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet S","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":130820,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130820}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-27T16:19:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":873592,"name":"Joanalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joanalyn is a married woman with seven children.

would mistake him for an expert in the agricultural field. Hillary, from a remote town in Kenya, is an active and progressive farmer of his locality. He has a lovely family, and together they live on a small piece of land. <br \/><br \/>Traditionally, his primary source of income has been milk, crops, and personal business (motorcycle business), and he has been practicing farming for the past ten years. Having farmed for such a long time, he has gained so much experience that he is always ranked the best farmer in his village. Therefore, he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. <br \/><br \/>Dairy farming is another profitable agricultural venture in Kenya, and Hillary has already identified the breed of dairy cow that he wants. He has planted many trees on his farm, and dairy food will never be a problem. Marketing of the dairy milk and dairy products will not be a challenge because he will sell the milk directly to the market and also to big dairy processing firms. Through the loan, Hillary will not only benefit from milk, but will also benefit from manure (cow dung) that will be used in improving the fertility of his farm, thus saving money that would have been spent buying fertilizer. <br \/><br \/>Hillary has been facing challenges in accessing finances, but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva are there to make his dream come true. Hillary chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low and is on a reducing basis. Hillary underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and during the training season he learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. <br \/><br \/>Through accumulated profits, Hillary plans to permanently improve his living conditions and secure the future of his school-aged children by paying tuition fees for them.

The loan will be used to buy rollers, dryers, braids, and will help Rose to generate greater profits and expand the business. Rose hopes that in the future she will be able to own a big saloon. \r\n\r\nRose is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

This makes him work harder to increase his business income to cover his family's increasing needs. \r\n\r\nMahmoud works hard to develop his farm. He has been raising cows and selling their milk since 1998. His family responsibilities and financial needs limit his business development.\r\n\r\nAn acquired loan from Kiva's field partner Al Majmoua is the best step forward toward buying the requested milking machine, which will increase his production and business income in a well-managed way.

She is studying law. She's smart, committed, reliable, sensible, responsible and hardworking. She studies in a public university in the Central area, which is characterized by a mixture of ancient, colonial, republican and modern influences. It is where ancient customs of native people meet modern, contemporary life. The climate is dry and cold with a temperature varying  during the day between 4-16 degrees Celsius.<br \/><br \/>Mirtha has a dark complexion, brown eyes and long black hair she wears loose. She is short of stature and medium-build physique. Her mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1, which she barely speaks because she studies and lives in the city. She lives in her grandfather's house with her mother who works. They live in a home built of brick and cement with a tin roof. The house has potable water, electricity, gas and sewerage. <br \/><br \/>Mirtha studied law and already finished coursework years ago, but she is not certified for lack of money required for licensing\/paperwork. She is currently working as an assistant in a law firm. She works with efficiency, accountability and a humanitarian sensibility with the whole multidisciplinary team. She is concerned with identifying the legal dimensions of problems in order to apply procedural techniques and strategies for obtaining and analyzing information concerning those problems. \"I studied law and successfully completed the coursework but have not been licensed for lack of resources,\" she comments.<br \/><br \/>The advantage of her current work is that it is in her field of study; the disadvantage is the lack of a professional degree that would validate her knowledge. Her dream is to become a professional to be able to work independently and help the many people who need her knowledge. She wants to pay for her degree certification to become licensed and independent. This is the first loan with the institution. It has been 10 years since she finished her studies and has been working as a law clerk.<br \/><br \/>Mirtha is requesting a loan to pay for college and get her degree in law in order to become

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to repair her home.<br \/><br \/>With this loan, Alice\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 6.5 acres of land and purchase a total of seven solar lights."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1803268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-27T17:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-27T17:50:04Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dinah M","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samwuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":102480,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102480}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":873664,"name":"Robert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robert is 40 years old, married to Ruth, and blessed with four children.

Their main income sources are milk and crops. \r\n\r\nFrom Kiva lenders, David is seeking a loan worth KES 30,000 to grow his horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to afford David access to a loan that will aid him in growing his horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, David\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business.

He is seeking a loan of KES 35,000 to start horticulture farming on his farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in his village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, Richard wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits. Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring men like Richard to make their farming dreams become reality through training and loan financing. \r\n\r\nRichard hopes that through the loan, he will improve his living conditions.

This is the sad story of Tom. He is a youthful 48-year-old man, and a wise farmer whose neighbors and fellow farmers respect him as a mentor. He farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills near Kitale, in the northern Rift Valley region of Kenya. Toms' farming experience dates back to 2000. Like many other farmers in the region, maize is a staple crop, which he has been planting for as long as he can remember. With time, the fertility of his land has started to dwindle and whenever he plants maize the yields go down with each crop season. Tom has also been affected with weeds. \r\n\r\nToday, Tom is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy fertilizers, pesticides and good quality seeds.

She is a smallholder farmer with extremely humble beginnings. She is based in Chepterit village in the Nandihills region of Kenya. Her upbringing was difficult. She never managed to finish her primary education, but she is very determined to give the best life to her children. \r\n\r\nFive years ago, Lenah started farming on her husband's 0.3-acre farm. She did it mostly for subsistence until recently. She keeps a dairy cow that gives her 10 liters of milk to sell every day. She also grows vegetables that she uses to prepare food, and to also sell. \r\n\r\nLinah is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow and increase her milk-vending business.

Meet Emmy, a youthful 30-year-old mother who is very kind, loving, and charming. She is based in Kachibora, a remote village in the Kitale area of Kenya. She is happily married and has four lovely children who depend on her for their basic needs. For the past decade, she has been involved in mixed farming on her small piece of land. Her major sources of income are egg-selling, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. Emmy is a mother who truly needs help. At 30 years old, she has the enormous responsibility of raising four children. The situation is very difficult because Emmy does not have a job. Emmy passionately loves poultry farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about poultry farming, her response was \u201cfeeding my poultry.\u201d She sells eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and at the local market, and, because of the high quality eggs, customers have been streaming into her compound and the demand has been overwhelming. To be able to meet the demand, Emmy is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan, she will buy quality breeds of poultry that have high productivity and hence satisfy the demand that is there. The increased income level will be used in improving her living conditions, and she plans on expanding her business to other towns. Other than increased profits, she will also benefit from the poultry manure, which will be used in her vegetable garden to increase productivity. Increased profits will make Emmy's business flourish and hence provide a secure and solid education to her children. You can help this woman improve her business, provide for her children, and be able to educate them.

She has a fourteen-year-old son and a twenty-year-old daughter. Her business is selling traditional food.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother and an understanding, enterprising, persevering, responsible, and hardworking woman. She runs her business in Fatravi, which is an industrial area. There is a lot of space there, which is used by different factories that produce paper and plastic, a soda bottling company, warehouses storing construction material, etc. The weather is cold and dry, with temperatures ranging from 0 to 12 degrees Celsius at an altitude of approximately 4,000 meters above sea level.\r\n\r\nPaulina has dark skin, brown eyes, and long black hair that she wears braided. She is short and stout and likes to wear traditional hats, skirts, and wraps. Her first language is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks among her family, but she also speaks Spanish, which she uses in general and for her business. She shares her life with her husband, who works as an electrician. They live in their own house, which is built out of brick and cement with a sheet-metal roof. They have all the basic utilities: water, sewer, gas, and electricity. \r\n\r\nShe works selling traditional food like plato pace\u00f1o (potatoes, fava beans, corn, and fried cheese), fricas\u00e9 (pork, corn, and chile stew), chairo (potato and lamb stew), and other dishes. She does this Monday through Sunday, dividing her work load: She leaves everything ready in the kitchen at night, and in the morning, once she has prepared all of the food, she places it in pots and containers in her two-wheel cart. She walks with it for a couple of kilometers until she arrives at her food stall, which is outdoors, on the street. When she arrives she unloads some benches to sit down and opens a couple of umbrellas, one for herself and one for her customers. Her customers are drivers, construction workers, sand suppliers, and other hardworking local people. \"I started my business helping my mother and then started out on my own. Sometimes my daughter helps me and other times I get help from a lady who knows how to cook...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that there isn't any competition in the area.

For the last 18 years he has been practicing mixed farming to support his family and siblings. John makes money selling milk and a variety of food crops, such as maize, from his farm. \r\n\r\nJohn is seeking a loan because he wants to get into the poultry business. This is a diversification from dairy and crop farming. He enjoys dairy farming as much as he does crop farming. However, the region usually experiences long dry spells, which inevitably affects crop harvests negatively. For this reason, John is seeking a loan to buy poultry. Poultry will serve both subsistence and commercial purposes. There is a high demand for poultry products in the developing town of Kisii, which is the nearest town to John's village. Proceeds from the sale of eggs will help John cope with the rising farm expenses that is putting many farmers in the region out of business. His long-term plan is to free his family from the chains of poverty. For John, this support will be very important, since it will be the first loan that he has gotten in his 43 years. The years are heavy, but he will continue working hard to give his family and siblings a good

She makes a living selling traditional food.\r\nShe is a good mother, independent, constant, understanding, generous, responsible and hardworking. She conducts her food sales in the \u201cPanamericana\u201d zone, a central area where public and private enterprises coexist side by side, such as restaurants, commercial galleries, movie theaters, ice cream parlors, family unit apartment buildings, universities, and all sorts of commerce types. Of mild weather and with a temperature that varies from 18\u00ba to 26\u00ba centigrade throughout the day.\r\nMartha is of dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair, usually tied back; short in stature and of robust physique. Her mother tongue is Quechua, which she speaks around family; she speaks Spanish for general culture and for the business she manages (she is the first on the right, sitting and wearing a black blouse with white polka dots and black trousers). She shares her life with her husband, who works as a salaried driver, and their daughters; the oldest is independent and the youngest attends school. They own the home they live in, which is made of adobe and brick with a tin roof; it has electricity, water from a well extracted through an electric pump. \r\n<p>\r\nThe need to improve their quality of life, led her to search for other micro-entrepreneurs with the same need, to form a partnership of people with businesses selling: baked goods, fresh juice, chickens, costume jewelry, public transport services, pork meat and baby diapers, to request a loan to improve their shops.\r\nHers is a food stall serving traditional food, which she cooks according to the day of the week:\r\nMonday: Chilijchi flower sauce (flowers of the ceibo tree with onion, tomato, green pepper and potatoes). \r\nTuesday: Rabbit (fried guinea pig on top of French fries and beef and with garnishes of freeze-dried potatoes and white potatoes). \r\nWednesday: Chajchu (filets of beef, green onion, tender broad beans, chopped freeze-dried potatoes, hard boiled eggs, onion sauce, tomatoes and locoto peppers, and covered in red chili). \r\nThursdays: Chanka de conejo (tender guinea pig cooked and flavored with mint, green onion, lima beans, locoto pepper and white potatoes).\r\nFriday: Pork rinds (fried pork with white corn and locoto pepper). \r\nSaturday: Fidius uch\u00fa (noodle in hot chili sauce).\r\nAnd Sunday: Phampaku (duck, piglet, lamb meats with condiments). \r\n<p>\r\n\u201cThe cooking process takes a long time, each dish can only be cooked once a week\u2026\u201d she says. Her advantage is that her clientele knows the menu in accordance to the day of the week. The disadvantage is that there is a large competition with the same menu.

Among them are selling clothing, selling fruit, selling sweets, selling soft drinks, selling food, and selling jackets.\r\n\r\nThe loan that they will take out will benefit these microentrepreneurs, of whom Se\u00f1ora Noemi is one. She indicates that she joined Pro Mujer six years ago, entering at the invitation of a friend who is a client of the institution. She now has a business of selling fruit. She lets it be known that she learned this business on her own initiative, since she knew the form of sales of her neighbor. It is for this reason that she decided to begin an independent business.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she will take out now is to increase her capital to buy fruit wholesale, which she will acquire from the wholesale vendors in the city of La Paz, and later she will sell it in the markets in the city of El Alto.

Thanks to the income earned, Julieta was able to purchase home supplies and cover basic costs for that time. \r\n\r\nJulieta is now the mother of two children, as her second son was born in 2014. After successfully paying her first loan back, Julieta asks for this second loan to purchase new stock of clothing (spring-summer collection) to cover customers' orders. \r\n\r\nShe has been approved for a loan within the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products.\r\n\r\nAs a responsible borrower, Julieta hopes for lenders' support one more time. She dreams of developing her retail business and providing her customers with fashionable and quality clothing.

institutions (M.F.Is) view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition. Juhudi Kilimo is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Kenyan farmers. Meet John, an ever-smiling, hardworking and honest father who is 34 years of age. He hails from the Nyamira area of Kenya. He is the proud father of four lovely children. He loves and treasures his children and will go the extra mile to make sure that they are comfortable. John's primary source of income has come from selling milk, crop farming, and poultry farming. Through these ventures, he has been able to earn a decent income. He is a very determined and dedicated farmer who has been farming for seven years, and throughout, he has never regretted going into farming. Although this humble dad has been making profits, not everything has been \u201ca bed of roses\". He faces financial challenges, and because the Nyamira area has proven a ready market for cereals, he is kindly seeking a loan to buy cereals for re-sale and thus improve his income. John's upbringing was challenging, and he has faced many economic problems. Still, this ever-smiling dad has been making great improvements, and he believes that through your loan, he will be able to realize his goal of improving his living conditions and transforming his life. Through Juhudi Kilimo, John has received training and he has proven to be honest and disciplined with finances. He intends to fully repay the loan with the profits from his business. John is quite visionary and - with his accumulated profits - hopes he will be able to open a large cereal-selling shop that will boost his income and turn his life around.\r\n\r\nKindly help him out!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":206.37,"image":{"id":1864079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals for re-sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-28T05:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-28T05:50:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.16,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.77,"local_amount":6646.59,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6998.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460182},{"amount":69.48,"local_amount":6176.31,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":6503.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588338},{"amount":61.96,"local_amount":5521.77,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5814.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.16,"payment_id":731023445}],"funded_date":"2015-05-28T04:22:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":873882,"name":"Aisha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aisha lives in Kampala, Uganda.

She lives with her partner and has a 5-year-old son. She sells food and other basic products at a school.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, and an entrepreneurial, independent, persistent, responsible and hardworking woman. Her store is located at a school in an area called \u201c16 de julio,\u201d which is a commercial area with small and medium-sized companies. It is cold and dry there, and the temperature ranges between 0 and 14 \u00b0C [32-57 \u00b0F]. This place is located 4,070 m [13,350 ft.] above sea level.\r\n\r\nAna has a dark complexion and dark eyes. She is short and has long, black braided hair. She wears traditional clothes (hat, shawl and long skirt). Her mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1. She speaks Aymar\u00e1 with her family, but she speaks Spanish when doing business and for cultural reasons. She shares her life with her partner, who works, and with her son, who has just started school. They live with her grandfather in a house made of brick and cement and with a metal roof, which is served with water, electricity, natural gas and sewage.\r\n\r\nAna sells different products at a school. Every day, she sells candies, cookies, sodas, juices, sweets, etc. She works from Monday to Friday in the morning and the afternoon. \u201cI started my business with very little money when I worked with my sister as a kitchen assistant,\u201d she says. The advantage of having this type of business is that she has time left to spend with her son. The disadvantage is that she has to close the store during the vacations period.

The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nSt. Charles Lwanga School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

He is happily married and has been blessed with angelic looking children. \r\n\r\nHe has farmed for five years, and has never regretted it. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crops. Most of the small-holder farmers in Kapletundo village own approximately \u00bc acre of land per household, and this has made them work extra hard to fully utilize their farms. He has been able to earn a decent and honest living by selling milk and eggs. These ventures have enabled him to send his children to school and feed his family. Geoffrey has planted many trees on his compound and also has Napier grass, which has high protein and is used to feed his dairy cow. This enhances his milk-selling profits. \r\n\r\nBecause of increased demand, Geoffrey requests a loan to buy a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is a very profitable venture, and he wants to take full advantage of the ready market for dairy products. Through the loan, Geoffrey is sure of satisfying the demand for milk in his area. Through increased profits, Geoffrey is sure that he will repay the loan on time and also be in a position to comfortably take care of his family. \r\n\r\nGeoffrey, with his entrepreneurial spirit, strength and tenacity, would like to continue fighting so that he can achieve his dream of owning his own business and empowering society by being a source of employment.
