The Start-Up program created by Kiva and Credo enabled her to get a loan of 5,200 GEL. \r\n\r\nThey will build traditional Georgian bakery and will start selling newly baked bread among local people. Svetlana thinks that the business will be profitable, as it is in a good location and is the only business of this kind in the area. After the bakery is opened, the family will have a stable income which enables them to cover everyday costs as well as expand the business in future.  \r\n\r\nWith the support of the Start-Up program, Svetlana will get an opportunity to be involved in her own business and tackle her financial difficulties."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":1864216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To open a traditional Georgian bakery and start selling bread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Salkhino","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2015-04-28T13:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-28T13:10:03Z","loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Svetlana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":5200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":94.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":159.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":168.14},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":168.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":173.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":182.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":183.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":192.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":193.89},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":199.39},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":211.43},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":211.04},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":219.83},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":223.27},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":232},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":236.18},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":242.88},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":251.52},{"due_date":"2016-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":256.91},{"due_date":"2016-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":265.48},{"due_date":"2017-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":271.72},{"due_date":"2017-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":279.43},{"due_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":288.96},{"due_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":295.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.28},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.14},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.18},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.42},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.43},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.92},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.15},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.53},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.36},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.29},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.83},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.73},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.6},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.59},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.46},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.87},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.7},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.49},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.94},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.2},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2325,"local_amount":5200,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5235.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665093281}],"funded_date":"2015-05-28T12:36:20Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T14:03:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":873920,"name":"Frech's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Frech is a proud 47-year-old father of 5 children.

His business is the manufacture of coats for women.  He is a good father, independent, enterprising, constant, responsible, and hard-working.  He carries out his work in the \"Max Paredes\" zone, a place characterized by the manufacture and sales of wholesale clothing, such as shoes, jackets, sweaters, scarves, quilts, etc. of local manufacture.  The climate is cold and dry with a daily temperature which varies between two and 14 degrees Celsius.\r\nSolsticio is dark-complected; with brown eyes; short, black hair; short stature; a thin frame; and his mother tongue is Aymara which he speaks with his family, though he speaks Spanish in public and in his work.  He shares his life with his wife who makes a living in the same business and with his baby who is already walking.  They live in his in-law's house constructed of brick and mortar with a corrugated zinc roof, which has running water, electricity, and drainage.  \r\nHis work is the manufacture of coats for women, such as jackets, bags, large sacks, coats, etc., work that he does every day of the week in his workshop located in a room in his house, taking turns with his wife to bring about the sales.  \"I learned sewing working 12 hours a day in the tailoring workshops of the city of Buenos Aires.  I returned and opened my own workshop,\" he says.  The advantage of his business is that because of the climate, his creations sell constantly.  The disadvantage is the lack of investment capital to access working material.  \r\nHis dream is to create a brand of clothing in order to sell his own designs.  He wishes to expand his business by way of the purchase of an industrial sewing machine in order to increase his production and sell wholesale.  This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in three years which is dedicated to this activity in independent form.  It is for these reasons that Solsticio is requesting a loan to buy an industrial sewing machine in order to create coats for women and sell them wholesale.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1863380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy an industrial sewing machine in order to manufacture women's coats and sell them wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-04-28T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-28T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Solsticio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-25T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T04:00:00Z","amount":371.3},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":439.82},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":514.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":528.7},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":551.91},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":569.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":612.57},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T04:00:00Z","amount":632.9},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T04:00:00Z","amount":651.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":687.51},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":718.76},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T04:00:00Z","amount":720.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.82},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.41},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.7},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.46},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.25},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Livingston Sutro","image":null}},{"id":874275,"name":"Melinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melinda is a married woman with two children.

They live and work in the village of Momissala, southeast of Bamako, in Mali. She is 45 years old and the mother of five children, aged 7 to 17, of whom three are currently in school. \r\n\r\nFatoumata is rooted in the family tradition of farming, the main source of income and of food self-sufficiency at home. Thus, she was encouraged to do this work for 20 years. She grows peanuts, rice, and sesame on her parcel of land. But, as a farmer, she must cope with difficulties, such as the lack of quality seeds and farm supplies. \r\n\r\nFatoumata is starting her first year with myAgro and signed up because of the possibility of increasing her yields through the services offered by myAgro. This year, she is making payments to purchase a myAgro packet of seeds and some fertilizer for growing peanuts, so as to increase her yields on her 0.25 hectare parcel of land.

They work and live in the village of Morodiambougou to the southeast of Bamako in Mali. Moussa, 54 years old, is the father of 23 children, who attend school. His family has been traditionally engaged in farm work, which is the main source of income. It provides food for the household and also provides sufficient means to cover other household expenses. This is why Moussa has been working as farmer for some 42 years. \r\nHe grows corn on his field. His challenges are low rainfall and lack of quality fertilizers and seeds. \r\n\r\nThis is Moussa's first year with myAgro; he has signed up for a payment plan, having heard about the positive impact of myAgro in his community. This year Moussa is making payments to purchase a packet of myAgro OPV [Open Pollinated Variety] seeds and fertilizers to increase  the yield of corn on his field of 0.5 ha [1.2 acres]. Moussa has been growing corn for 38 years because of the economic returns and market demand.  Thanks to a larger harvest and a higher revenue, Moussa hopes to expand the size of his field. He also hope to be able to provide for the family's food as well for his children's weddings.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1864298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and fertilizers to grow corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Moridiambougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-04-29T04:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-29T04:10:07Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamadou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Drissa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sekou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":936000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":936000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1550,"local_amount":936000,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":947771.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401567}],"funded_date":"2015-04-29T19:01:12Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:14:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":874481,"name":"Mwoloto Women Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The woman raising her hand in the photo is Agnes.
