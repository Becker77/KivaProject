Through her business, she can now provide and support her family's daily needs. \r\n\r\nHowever, Vivian dreams of expanding her inventory. This is why she is asking for another PHP 20,000 loan. With this, she will be able to increase the quantity of supplies of her selected products. She will utilize the loan to buy more onions and garlic, which are basic ingredients in every Filipino dish. For sure, profit will increase since her items are what people usually purchase. In advance, she says thanks for your consideration and generosity. \r\n\r\nAs of now, what Vivian hopes is just to simply grow her business and be in peace without problems intruding. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,500 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo improve her sales and profit, she is requesting from the ever-generous Kiva lenders a loan of PHP 8,000. She will be buying more supplies of merchandise products that she needs in her business. \r\n\r\nNormelita hopes that her business will thrive more. She aims someday to own and manage a bigger business to help her cope with their daily needs and expenses. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1864889,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional supplies of merchandise and other direct selling items ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-04-29T07:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-29T07:50:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Normelita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.36,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2360,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649536576},{"amount":53.32,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:55:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2359.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017809},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2949.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314224},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1066.71,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1180.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522921}],"funded_date":"2015-04-29T11:50:29Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":874504,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emily is 57 years old, married and has seven children.\r\n\r\nEmily is in the agricultural business, farming rice in the Philippines.

He is 43 years old. He was born and raised in the countryside. From childhood he has been diligent and loved to study. His love for learning roused him to go to college, where he obtained a partial higher education. \r\n\r\nHe is a very hardworking man. He is a family man, and the caring father of four children. Because he himself loved learning, he is making the effort to ensure that his children also receive a higher education, and with it make a significant contribution to the development of their republic.\r\n\r\nGulom sets up all the conditions so that his children get all the knowledge that is necessary to them. This year, his son entered a higher education institute. Like his father, he also loves books, and wants to learn all the finer points of computer technology. He is studying computers in university, but in order to study well it is necessary for him to work at home as well.\r\n\r\nIn order to buy a notebook and to pay for his son's education, Gulom needs funds. Gulom has applied for a loan from MDO Arvand. On receiving the loan, he intends to buy a notebook and pay for his son's

Ahora a sus 42 a\u00f1os de edad tiene seis hijos entre las edades de 21 a 7 a\u00f1os, quienes son la principal motivaci\u00f3n para salir adelante y quienes apoyan a su padre en el campo sin dejar de ir al colegio. \nLa agricultura sin duda se ha convertido en el estilo de vida de Marcial durante 25 a\u00f1os, quien adem\u00e1s de sembrar en tierras nicarag\u00fcenses, tiene que viajar en verano a Costa Rica para poder darle una buena vida a su familia. Por esta raz\u00f3n es que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar abono, refrescante, herbicidas y pagar mano de obra para est\u00e1 pr\u00f3xima cosecha de frijol y as\u00ed poder producir un cultivo de calidad. Adem\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n planea comprar una vaquilla para incursionar en el mundo de la ganader\u00eda.

Over time, he learned and became passionate about this work as a farmer, until he was twenty and started working on his own with help of his current wife. He started farming for personal consumption and to sell as a way to support his family, which was starting to grow. Now at 42 years of age, he has six children between the ages of 21 and 7 years old, who are his main motivation to prosper, and who support their father in the field as well as attending school. Undoubtedly, farming has become a way of life for Marcial during 25 years. Besides farming in Nicaraguan soil, he needs to travel to Costa Rica in the summer to give his family a good life. For this reason, he is requesting a loan to buy manure, refresher, herbicides, and to pay for hand labor for this next bean harvest, so that he is able to produce a quality crop. Also, he wants to buy a heifer to start working in animal husbandry. Among his plans are to buy more land and another heifer to keep on growing. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1864469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy manure, refresher, herbicides, and to pay for hand labor.

Meet Cerestine from Kenyenya, Kenya, a woman from a community not known for farming, but one who is earning a living through agriculture. She is happily married and together with her husband, is blessed with a lovely family. <br \/><br \/>For the past five years, Cerestine has been practicing mixed farming and, due to the experience she has, commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers who regard her as a mentor. Selling milk, eggs, and vegetables has allowed her to earn a decent income. To make extra money, Cerestine also engages in a small personal business. <br \/><br \/>Cerestine passionately loves dairy farming, and one of the animals on her farm has been given a nickname. Milking and feeding the cow makes her very proud. Through milk selling, she has had quite good returns, and the demand for milk has been expanding. Through extensive use of her mobile phone, she has been receiving orders from customers. <br \/><br \/>Because demand has been overwhelming, Cerestine is requesting a loan to buy a quality dairy cow, a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce 10-20 litres of rich, creamy milk daily. The increased milk production will result in more income, and Cerestine will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her school-going children. <br \/><br \/>When people listen to Cerestine speak, they can be forgiven for thinking that she is an expert in dairy farming because of her passion and determination. This loan will permanently change the living standards of Cerestine, and there is no doubt that rewarding employment can be found in dairy farming."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":268.14,"image":{"id":1865016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kenyenya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-29T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-29T16:50:05Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cerestine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3680.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3787.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3898.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4012.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4129.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4250.32},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4374.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4502.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4633.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4769.39},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4908.78},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5052.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.74,"local_amount":4136.21,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4288.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460187},{"amount":41,"local_amount":3707.93,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3844.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378600},{"amount":44.18,"local_amount":3995.57,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4142.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588343},{"amount":44.43,"local_amount":4104.56,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4255.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.96,"payment_id":711506578},{"amount":46.97,"local_amount":4251.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4407.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.04,"payment_id":731023449},{"amount":44.82,"local_amount":4053.65,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4202.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111566}],"funded_date":"2015-05-01T13:55:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":874644,"name":"Sajida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sajida is living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

The above picture presents to you Joshua, who is a hard-working, creative, and ingenious man and a passionate farmer. He is the father of three lovely children. He hails from the Nkubu area of Kenya, a region known for growing bananas.\r\n\r\nJoshua was raised in challenging circumstances and his basic needs were never covered, so he vowed he would turn his life around and live a comfortable life. That is why he started mixed farming, and he has been farming for the past 42 years. Through dedication, hard work and commitment, he has been able to provide for the basic needs of his family. \r\n\r\nAlthough he makes some profit, he has the challenge of an inadequate water supply for irrigating his crops and even for his home consumption. Most of the rain water is wasted, and Joshua wants to harvest that water. That is why he is kindly requesting a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. The Nkubu area has no piped water, and this means that you have to travel for long distances in search of \u201cthis precious commodity.\u201d But, with the loan, he will be able to store water for home consumption. The loan will also help Joshua irrigate his farm. He plans to use the sprinkle irrigation method, so that there will be a high production level on his farm. Joshua always says water is a very precious commodity and should not go to waste. \r\n\r\nHaving access to funds is very challenging for smallholder farmers in Kenya, but with partners such as Kiva and Juhudi Kilimo, Joshua is sure that his dreams will become a reality and he will be able to improve his living conditions. The profits from increased production of crops will be used to repay the loan and also to improve his living conditions. He also plans to buy more water tanks and water pipes so that he can harvest as much water as possible. \r\n\r\nJoshua awaits your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":107.12,"image":{"id":1865089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a water tank and water pipes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-29T17:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-29T17:30:08Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.04,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.15,"local_amount":3213.26,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3389.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460189},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":3056.16,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588345},{"amount":36.55,"local_amount":3252.17,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3430.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.04,"payment_id":731023451}],"funded_date":"2015-04-29T17:52:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Barrett","image":1341863}},{"id":874668,"name":"Linet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linet is a smallholder farmer in Etono, located in the Kenyenya region of Kenya.

He is very excited about this addition since now he will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.\r\n\r\nUsing this loan, Titus's Group will purchase a total of nine solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 7.75 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1865107,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light, as well as hybrid seeds and fertilizer to improve harvests of maize.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-29T18:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-29T18:50:04Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Titus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice K","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kwekunda","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":115330,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115330}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-29T16:20:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":874020,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora es casada,tiene dos hijas por lo que tiene que apoyar a su esposo trabajando en una peque\u00f1a farmacia desde hace 7 a\u00f1os, a pesar de que su salario es bajo, apoya economicamente a una sobrina de 17 a\u00f1os quien vive con ella y su familia desde que tiene 5 a\u00f1os, ya que perdi\u00f3 a sus padres.

Earlier he was selling Alu Chat (Pakistani Food), which is cheaper than burgers. He does not have enough cash in hand to buy ingredients for offering his next food item.\n\nTherefore, Razia has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that she can do financially help her son. With the help of this loan, he can easily buy the described ingredients. \n\nRazia is 59 years old, living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. Razia and her son offer thanks to Kiva and the field partner, BRAC Pakistan.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":359.92,"image":{"id":1858734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"a loan helps RAZIA's son in purchasing burger's ingredients such as eggs, spices, oil, onion, cauliflower and tomato ketchup for food stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2015-04-29T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-29T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Razia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4708},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4846},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4987},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5133},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5283},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5438},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5597},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5760},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5928},{"due_date":"2016-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6102},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":6280},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4938}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.08},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.6},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.28},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.02},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.8},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.54,"local_amount":9554,"processed_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T12:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":9722.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665396153},{"amount":49.87,"local_amount":4987,"processed_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:05:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5074.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681298333},{"amount":51.33,"local_amount":5133,"processed_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-24T12:20:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5223.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":698258891},{"amount":52.83,"local_amount":5283,"processed_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:20:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5375.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711417763},{"amount":54.38,"local_amount":5438,"processed_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5533.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731221851},{"amount":55.97,"local_amount":5597,"processed_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-20T13:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5695.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":753601240}],"funded_date":"2015-05-20T19:44:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tom D"}},{"id":874719,"name":"Stanley's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stanley, pictured above, has been a farmer for 20 years and is now proud to represent his group of five farmers in Matete District.

This is Rodney. He is the Business Administrator of Kabateraine Schools, a mixed nursery and primary school in the urban area of Mbarara, with a total of 920 students. Kabateraine Schools has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining two UV water filtration systems to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children.

His primary source of income has been milk, poultry, crops and some small personal business he engages in to supplement his meager income. <br \/><br \/>James passionately loves dairy farming, but one challenge he has been facing is lack of water for home consumption and irrigating his farm. Most of the rainwater goes to waste and therefore James is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to buy a water tank and water pipes. With the water tank he will be able to harvest and store rainwater in the tank. This loan will be of much help because James will not be walking for long distances in search of this precious commodity. The tank will assist him in irrigating his farm, hence increasing productivity and his income level.

Abigael also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study.<br \/><br \/>Obtaining this loan means that Abigael's Group will be able to receive a total of 5 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 4.25 acres."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1798237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete-","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-29T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-29T21:10:03Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abigael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asmini N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janepher N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janepher","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65570,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65570}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-29T15:38:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}},{"id":874777,"name":"Melitona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melitona is a 45-year-old woman with various businesses.

the remote village of, Kisii. He has been practicing agribusiness for the past ten years and has never looked back. For a living, Lameck sells milk and food products from his farm to the local market. He enjoys seeing clients coming back for more of his products and he really feels satisfied. \r\n\r\nAlthough Lameck has been making profits through farming, he has always wanted to do poultry farming. The main challenge he has encountered is a lack of funds to get his business off the ground. Lameck is seeking a loan to buy quality breeds of poultry. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Kisii and is a business that can be done on a part-time basis to earn extra income. Lameck does not worry too much about competition, because the market for poultry products is good - chicken is a popular meal for many people and this can be seen if you visit any fast food joint. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Lameck is confident that his income will increase and this will allow a permanent change in his life. He plans to buy different breeds of broilers and layers and will be selling eggs and meat to the local market and other major markets in Kenya. He also plans to start breeding, which will help increase the number of poultry on his farm. Other than profits from selling eggs, poultry feathers, and poultry meat, Lameck will also benefit from using the poultry manure, which is an excellent source of nutrients for his farm.

He decided that he will be independent and contribute to his community by practicing mixed farming. His primary sources of income are milk, maize and poultry farming, as well as some personal business that he does to supplement his meager income. For the past five years, Evans has been earning a decent income from poultry farming. However, the demand is overwhelming and he wants to increase his poultry stock, but the biggest challenge is lack of funds. He is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. Poultry farming has become one of the most important aspects of agriculture in Kenya because it creates business opportunities for entrepreneurs and it\u2019s a kind of business that can never dry up. Poultry farming is a less strenuous activity and is profitable. Many poultry farmers find a sense of fulfillment having hens all over their homestead. The hens lay eggs that can be consumed or sold. If taken seriously, poultry farming has the potential of being a big business because the demand for poultry products is always high. With your loan, Evans is going to make more income that will enable him to take care of his family's expenses. As the times keep getting harder, Evans is doing all he can do to ensure that his family's basic needs are met."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":102.24,"image":{"id":1865233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-04-29T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-29T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.02,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.34},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.96},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":5331.06,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5414.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588348},{"amount":23.36,"local_amount":2158.35,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2192.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.02,"payment_id":731023455},{"amount":21.11,"local_amount":1948.27,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1978.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111568}],"funded_date":"2015-05-29T15:38:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":874820,"name":"Abishyizehamwe Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abishyizehamwe is a group led by Kapitoline who is 38 years old.

He has a wife, two school-aged children, and pensioner mother. Sadly, for lack of economic resources, and because he had to start working at a very young age, Zurab was unable to study a professional career. He works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing maize and nuts, and breeds cattle and has a milk-cow to produce milk products. He always has high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price.  \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Zurab decided to start a retail business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program, that is joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables the rural poor to get loans for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 3,000 GEL for purchasing a stock of polyethylene bags and to start selling them at the local market.\r\n\r\nAfter the business is started, the family will have a stable income, which will enable them to cover everyday costs, as well as expand the business in the future.

The ladies have different kinds of commercial businesses which include the sale of food (spices, fruits, vegetables) and animals (chickens, pigs) as well as the purchase and sale of scrap metal. The women not only conduct business in their community but also in neighboring communities on market days. They share that one day each week, going to 3 nearby communities to sell their products.\r\n\r\nAna is the 23-year-old President of the Trust Bank who has been with the group for 2 years. She has one son. This will be her first loan via Kiva and she is quite excited. Ana is a lively, proactive and inspiring young woman who has strong leadership skills. Her parents were only able to send her to school up to the first grade, but she is motivated to learn as much as she can to raise her standard of living and give her child the best life that she can. With her loan, Ana would like to buy inventory for her business, including spices, chile, and coffee. She would like to sell in the nearby markets with the short-term goal of increasing clientele, realizing additional income, and helping her husband support the household.\r\n\r\nThe women benefit from the knowledge that they gain from their monthly meetings when a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares valuable and practical information with them. The ladies learn how to be successful in their businesses as they learn about designing a business plan, budgeting, pricing, marketing, and customer service.\r\n\r\nKiva investors are valuable partners in this effort and are much appreciated by the ladies of \u201cLas Ganadoras\u201d.

Blanca desea mejorar la entrada de su vivienda, ya que como se observa en la fotograf\u00eda este es de tierra, y en \u00e9poca lluviosa se vuelve muy dif\u00edcil el acceso, por lo que ella desea construir unas gradas en su vivienda, para ello solicita un cr\u00e9dito a FUSAI para invertir en: cemento, arena, grava, ladrillo y hierro para construir las gradas de su vivienda lo antes posible.","en":"Blanca is a 36-year-old woman who lives in her own house with her husband and her children whom she supports along with her husband so that they can study.  She is an enterprising woman who has installed a carpenter's shop in her residence where they make beds from wood and reeds which allows them to sustain the household economy.\r\nBlanca wants to improve the entrance to the residence since as one can see from the photograph it is dirt and in the rainy season it makes access difficult.  For this reason, she wishes to construct some steps to her house and therefore she is requesting a loan from FUSAI in order to invest in cement, sand, gravel, brick, and rebar in order to construct the steps of her house as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":210.91,"image":{"id":1865342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Born in Cleveland, Ohio, his passion for cutting hair led him to start his own barber business, which he kept up for years. He attended college in Florida, and then decided to move to Atlanta, Georgia to pursue his dream as a master barber and business owner. \r\n\r\nFor years, he worked as a master barber independent contractor at barbershops.  In 2014, he was able to open his own barbershop, offering services to men, women, and children. While he currently works with an independent contractor, he hopes to hire two more barbers\/contractors in the near future. \r\n\r\nBeing able to open the doors to his own establishment, \"The House of Barbers\", has been Karl\u2019s greatest success. After all, it \u201chas been a lifelong dream. My mother encouraged me to become a Master Barber and open my own business. I know that she would be proud of me for finally doing it.\u201d\r\n\r\nKarl\u2019s greatest difficulty has been finding qualified master barbers to hire. He has also faced advertising challenges. With this loan he will increase advertising efforts to gain additional contractors and grow his customer base. He will also purchase more operating equipment such as a sink, dryer, mirrors, barber chairs, and additional supplies.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to have a complete staff of independent contractors, and be able to grow and operate as a reputable company. Further down the road, his vision is to open a barber school, providing continuing education and preparing potential barbers for the state exam. He would also like to operate in public schools as an integrated education system so that young men and women can begin exploring the profession as early as age 16.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1153.15,"image":{"id":1865403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber

His greatest success has been being able to grow membership in less than ten years from 76 members to over 300 members.\r\n\r\nHowever, he has run into the challenge of obtaining enough working capital to improve and maintain the club.

He anticipates this will be a great way to add membership and increase revenue.\r\n\r\nHis future goals are to develop the tennis and swim club into one of the best in town, popular enough to have a wait-list for obtaining membership.

sweet, dried fruits and nuts popular in her native Colombia. Back in Colombia, her family owned supermarkets and sold sweets that her grandmother and aunt would make. After moving to the US, her family decided to continue the family business in the food industry.\r\n\r\nLina dreams big, and it is her passion to be a businesswoman. Her work helps her support herself and her son. She wants to establish a company where she can help others to be providers for their family. This business has turned into a dream that she wants to continue. Mani nuts are typical products in Latin American countries, and by selling it in the US, she is helping Latin Americans living in the US to remember and retain some of their own culture.\r\n\r\nLina\u2019s greatest success has been the positive reception of her products in her community. However, one of her greatest difficulties has been obtaining enough funds to acquire necessary products and equipment at wholesale prices\u2014currently she is buying smaller quantities at higher prices per supply.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this loan is to pay outstanding debts, purchase more products and equipment, and pay to incorporate the company. Her future goals are to expand distribution and production throughout the New England area and later expand throughout the nation. She wants to give job opportunities to people in need and help as many families as possible. She also wants to provide Latin Americans living in the US with an opportunity to experience a bit of their home country. Perhaps, later, she will expand her business to other countries. \u201cWhy not?\u201d she says, \u201cManiNuts Global!\u201d\r\n\r\nCheck out her website at
