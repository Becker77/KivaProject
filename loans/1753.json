The group was made up of 11 hardworking and enthusiastic women who shared a common vision of improving themselves, working harder with the goal of maintaining and growing their small businesses. The ladies happily report that this first loan has been paid back fully, and that they are requesting an additional loan from Kiva.  Currently, there are 10 women in the Trust Bank who share that they are most grateful for the loan as it has been such a huge help for them and their families.\r\n\r\nFor the first loan cycle, we featured Antonia whose goal was to attract more customers and generate more income to raise her standard of living. Antonia was able to maintain and expand sales for her textile business, which included the sale of traditional blouses, napkins, tablecloths and aprons. With her increased income, she was able to purchase materials (wood and tiles) and other supplies to fufill a long-time dream of constructing her home. With a new loan, Antonia would like to purchase raw, materials including traditional fabric, as well as fabric for lining. She would also like to buy thread, trim and decorations for blouses, napkins, tablecloths and aprons.\r\n\r\nAntonia and her friends in the Trust Bank participate in educational seminars at their monthly meetings. A Friendship Bridge Loan Officer exposes the women to knowledge about the world around them and within them. Using pictures, drawing and role playing, the women learn about empowerment, how to raise their self-esteem, and the rights that they have as women. They learn to care for themselves and their families with new information about nutrition, health, hygiene and the use of medicinal plants. Finally, the ladies learn to effectively manage their loans and small businesses as they learn about budgeting, marketing, customer service, accounting and pricing. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of small loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe 10 women in the \u201cDios es Amor\u201d Trust Bank express their appreciation to Kiva and Friendship Bridge for the assistance in the form of loans and education that helps them improve their businesses and realize progress in their lives. Thank you, Kiva

grandchildren. Lahla has had a difficult road in attaining happiness and tranquility. Lahla began working at 12 years old, helping the neighbors with housework, watching livestock, harvesting hay from fields, and selling produce at the market. She was a child with \"golden hands\": she learned to do many things, and do them very well. Lahla also studied diligently in school and received good grades. At 18 years old, Lahla got married and moved to her husband's house. After a few years, Lahla began her own animal husbandry business. Today, Lahla has 3 cows and 5 sheep in her herd. Despite her age, Lahla loves working at her own business and happily spends her time outside. \r\n\r\nLahla is currently planning to buy livestock feed and to purchase a young lamb. However, she does not have the full sum of money this would require, so she has approached MDO Arvand for financial support.

boy. She lives with her husband and children in a small house. She works in agriculture with plenty of activities such as cultivating rice and growing corn, and raising pigs, chickens and ducks. \r\n\r\nHuong works very hard but the income generated from her agricultural production is unstable and insufficient to cover her family's living expenses.

Her business is selling traditional food.  She is a good mother, enterprising, understanding, patient, responsible, and hard-working.  She carries out her business in the industrial neighborhood \"18 de Mayo\".  This place is characterized by great commercial growth and manufacturing of all kinds, its population originating from the native \"Ayoreas\" tribes as well as from miners who relocated from the western part of the country, and by its tropical climate with daily temperatures between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nNatividad has a dark complexion, dark eyes, and long black hair that she wears tied up.  She is short and has a robust physique.  Her native language is Guaran\u00ed but she speaks Spanish in the general public and for work.  (She is the first on the left, wearing an orange shirt.)  She shares her life with her partner, who works as a builder, and her children.  The oldest child attends school and the youngest is not yet school-aged.  They live in a rented room made of brick and cement.  It has a corrugated metal roof, potable water, electricity, and a sewage system.\r\n\r\nNatividad's desire to better herself led her to form a communal bank with other people in order to ask for a loan and improve their businesses.  The other members' businesses include selling secondhand clothing, selling breakfast, transportation services, selling slippers, a welding workshop, selling dairy products, and selling wallets. Natividad's business consists of selling fast food like empanadas, hamburgers, sausages, fried chicken, and other items.  It is a job she carries out during the day from Monday to Saturday in her own kiosk, but it does not have a roof or any furniture.  \r\n\r\n\"I sell food and I sell tac\u00fas (a type of mortar and pestle) which are used to grind the yuca; they are basic tools in all the kitchens in this area...\" she says.\r\n\r\nOne advantage to her business is the population's habit of walking and eating.  A disadvantage is her lack of furniture for improving the care she gives her customers and improving her sales.  Her dream is to open a chain of fast food restaurants.  She wishes to expand her business through the purchase of tables and chairs in order to provide better comfort for her customers and to improve her sales.  This is her second loan cycle with the institution in the two years that she has carried out this business.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Natividad is asking for a loan to buy tables and chairs in order to provide better comfort for her customers and to improve her sales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4500,"image":{"id":1865351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables and chairs in order to provide better comfort for her customers and improve her sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-04-30T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-30T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":4500,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilfa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Javier Robustiano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Weslida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delfin Demetrio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-26T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":31000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":4500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-28T04:00:00Z","amount":3234.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T04:00:00Z","amount":3553.96},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T04:00:00Z","amount":3683.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T04:00:00Z","amount":3817.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T04:00:00Z","amount":3956.35},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T04:00:00Z","amount":4100.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T04:00:00Z","amount":4249.62},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":4404.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":469.56},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":515.9},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":534.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":554.14},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":574.31},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":595.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":616.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":639.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":985.46,"local_amount":6788.68,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6799.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046662},{"amount":534.67,"local_amount":3683.32,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3689.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344482},{"amount":554.14,"local_amount":3817.4,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3823.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554694},{"amount":574.31,"local_amount":3956.35,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3962.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468782},{"amount":595.21,"local_amount":4100.37,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4106.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296620},{"amount":1256.21,"local_amount":8653.88,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:56Z","rounded_local_amount":8667.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076818}],"funded_date":"2015-05-30T05:35:07Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":874822,"name":"Fawade","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Fawade est membre du groupe depuis le 16 D\u00e9cembre 2011.\n \nElle fait partie des membres du comit\u00e9 de gestion de son Banc Villageois.Elle est une femme leader et exemplaire. \n\nElle est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 43ans.Elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 03 enfants dont 1 gar\u00e7on.\n\nElle compte investir les 300000 F CFA pour acheter des habits(friperies).

He is a hardworking man and aggressive with the principle of truth on his lips; he is honest and faithful to what he does and what he says. \n\nHis primary sources of income have been milk, poultry, and some \u201cside hustles\" he does to supplement the meager income he earns from farming. \n\nThe remote village of the Kimilili area has only one diesel posho (maize grinding) mill that serves a sea of people, but the mill keeps breaking down; hence, farmers are not able to grind their maize. \n\nMark intends to change this and is requesting a loan to buy an electric posho mill, which will grind corn or maize into flour. Maize meal is very common in Kenya and is a staple food for many communities. Many Kenyan families consume the maize product \u201cugali\u201c (hard porridge) regularly. The market usually provides sifted flour, but the cost is higher because of the sifting and packaging. Cheaper flour can be obtained by milling the maize directly using a posho mill. \n\nThrough this loan, Mark will be able to grind maize faster because he will use an electric posho mill. Cases of breakdown will be history, because electric posho mills are more reliable. This loan will assist Mark to permanently change his life and achieve his life's mission of bringing economic development and poverty alleviation to communities in arid and semi-arid areas.

In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all of the products are essential household items and food. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also makes peanut butter and sells it at her store. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.

Part of the loan she will use to buy peanuts, oil, sugar and containers to make peanut butter for sale. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her and for a good return on her investment, as it will surely cover their daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nMiriam hopes to buy her own \"gilingan\" (equipment to grind peanuts).

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to rent more land to cultivate.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Annah\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 4 acres of land and purchase a total of five solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1799801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-04-30T21:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-30T21:00:07Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Musanga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":58020,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58020}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-24T08:42:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":875369,"name":"Mey's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mey is a potato farmer and worker for other farmers, living in Bovel district of Battambang province.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>St.Maria School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

She has her business in the \u2018Max Paredes\u2019 area, a place known for selling clothes, made in the country, such as shoes, jackets, sweaters, blankets and bedspreads, at wholesale prices. The weather here is cold and dry, with temperatures varying during the day between 2-14 degrees Celsius.

Her native language is Aymar\u00e1 which she speaks withe her family, and she speaks Spanish as general culture and in her business. She shares her life with her husband, who works as a driver. They live in their own house, built with brick and cement, with corrugated iron roof, drinking water, electricity and sewerage. Her business is selling food and basic staples such as bread, sugar, noodles, rice, flour, sweets, water, soft-drinks, and a variety of items, at her neighborhood store. She works every day from very early in the morning until past midnight. \"Work starts very early when the bread arrives and finishes very late when it is very cold...\", she comments. The advantage of her business is that she has regular customers; the disadvantage is the lack of investment capital to buy a variety of food and basic staples such as rice, noodles, flour and sugar at wholesale prices to stock up her stall and open a bigger store. This is her third loan cycle with the institution in the 20 years that she has worked in this job. These are the reasons why Marcela is requesting a loan to buy a variety of groceries to stock up her business and open a bigger store.

For the last thirteen years, she has had a farm that is the primary source of income for the family. Due to her hard work Salamat's farm now has 4 cows, 15 sheep, and 2 horses.

She is married and has two children. Her daughter is 10 years old and her son is 7. Muslima and her family live in Jilikul. Muslima's husband is a school teacher. He pays a great deal of attention to education and children's learning. Muslima has time to do household chores and work in the barnyard. She has a pair of cattle. Muslima gets calves, fattens them, and then resells them for a profit. This brings a bit of income into the house. She, certainly, helps and supports her husband.

She's studying at the university in the area of Central, an area known for being encircled by buildings that house commercial offices, public offices, restaurants, public squares and all types of businesses. The climate is cold and dry with temperatures that vary throughout the day between 4-16 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nYoselin has a dark complexion, gray eyes, long black fashionably combed hair, short in stature, of slender build, and her native tongue is Aymara. She barely speaks it because she goes to school and lives in the city. She lives her life in her father's house, he works as a salesperson, and with her sister who's a high school student. They live in a house of their own built out of brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof. It has potable water, electricity, gas and sewage. She's studying for a degree in Medicine and is currently in the 2nd year of the 5 year program. She enjoys helping people and likes to understand the symptoms of illness. Serving is in her personality. At the same time she participates in a second activity, which is working as a traveling cosmetics salesperson. She sells; lipstick, perfume, nail polish, creams, etc. She works on this business on weekends and holidays.\r\n\r\n\"I study Medicine and work on my business, the two don't overlap...\" she states. The advantage of her business is the weekend and holiday schedule, which gives her time to study. The disadvantage is the lack of investment capital for both activities. Her dream is to become a professional so that she can work at a hospital and help lots of patients. She wants to purchase a portable computer to continue and finish her studies. This is her first loan application with the institution in the two years that she's been studying for her career. These are the reasons Yoselin is requesting a loan to purchase a portable computer to continue with her studies and finish her

She makes decent money. Her sons are grown and work in construction. They also bring home a decent income. <br \/><br \/>That income is enough to support Barno. However, she has a dream: she and her husband want to build a big house for the family. But for that, she needs money. They do not earn enough to afford building a new home. Therefore, Barno asked Arvand for a loan to buy building materials to construct the house.

Since seeing how hard his parents had to work to support the family in childhood, he decided to take up farming and to help his parents. His father gave him experience and he taught himself to farm. Now Mansurbek has 4 hectares of land. He grows mainly grains, such as rice, wheat, corn, and rye. Currently Mansurbek doesn't have money to buy fertilizer.
