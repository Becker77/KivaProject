With the profits from this coming season, Jacob is planning to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nA total of 3.25 acres will be planted by Jacob's Group, and between them, they will receive a total of six solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1800288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, as well as a solar light.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-05-01T05:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-31T05:50:05Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Repher","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Godfrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meshack","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":57600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-13T15:04:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":875525,"name":"Tegwend\u00e9 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Abzeta, responsable du groupe est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 6 enfants.

","en":"Zharkynai is 39 years old, she is married and has 3 children. \r\nShe has completed a secondary education, and for many years she has been providing sewing services: cutting-out, restoration, sewing (dresses, gowns, jerkins, festive costumes, bedding). \r\nFor a year now Zharkynai has been renting a container near the market in the village center. \r\nBesides she and her husband are renting out a plot of land for 5,000 som (KGS). \r\nZharkynai's spouse has been working as a mechanic at a hydropower station for 5 years. Also Zharkynai has 0.75 ha of land, which she uses for crop cultivation - she is growing watermelons for sale. Thus, her and her husband's total monthly income is about 23,700 som (KGS).\r\nSince Zharkynai herself has been providing sewing services for a sufficiently long time, she decided to start trading knitted fabrics. She had previously calculated that this product is in great demand. This idea came to Zharkynai even when she was just starting her sewing business, but at the time she didn't have funds and thus couldn't implement the idea.\r\nRecently Zharkynai decided that she will finally take on the business she has been dreaming about for a long time, so without hesitation she found a place for the sale of goods  (the container). It is located in the center of the village. As the location is well traveled, Zharkynai expects that there will be enough customers. \r\nShe is going to buy fabrics at the largest markets in the region at a wholesale price and then resell in her store. \r\nZharkynai plans to hire a car and a carrier to go purchase the goods once a week.  Zharkynai already has potential buyers, and the whole family will help with this start-up. \r\nZharkynai intends to not set the resale prices high, as it is necessary to attract customers in the first place, and a competitive price will contribute to this. \r\nZharkynai's expected monthly income from trading totals to about 35,000 som (KGS).\r\nZharkynai asked the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank  for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase the initial batch of fabric for sale. She plans to invest the proceeds from the loan in the development of her new business and the education of her sons. Her eldest son is a student and her youngest are going to enroll into the university this year."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":410.21,"image":{"id":1869094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy knitted fabrics in order to realize her dream and start her own resale business.

She is married with six children between the ages of 13 and 25 years old. The children all go to school. \r\n\r\nBelie is a farmer and she has been in business for the past six years. Her husband is also a farmer. Belie is the one in the photo whose hand is raised; the other person is a seller. With the loan from Kiva, she would like to buy more cows for rearing. The profits from the business will be used to increase her welfare and buy a piece of land for rearing cows.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

The Alcatraces group is formed by 12 inhabitants from this village.

Irma is a single mother who has been challenged with raising her three children, a young lady age 20 years old, and two small children ages 10 and 5, respectively. For the past three years, Irma began to sell typical Mexican snacks. At the beginning, she only had a small grill, three tables, and a tarp to protect the area from sun and rain. Later, and with her mother and daughter's help, Irma was able to buy a small stand (metallic frame,) 3 small tables,chairs, and she has more tarps to offer a better service. Irma's life is very active: \"in the morning, I am a housewife, and from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. I work seven days a week selling Mexican snacks at the community park.\" Working hard has allowed her to provide education for her children and to buy appliances for her house. With the opportunity of this loan, Irma will be able to invest in metallic sheets, tubulars, rails and bolts. She will use these materials to build a new roof so that her clients can be more comfortable as they enjoy their flavorful snacks. The Alcatraces group thanks all of those who have made this opportunity possible of obtaining loans to ensure that their activities bear greater results.     *The picture was taken in one of the town's streets, in front of Mrs. Mari's house.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

With the loan from Kiva, she would like to buy more cows for rearing. The profits from the business will be used to increase her savings and to pay the school fees of her children.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She is married and has three children. Sayyora lives with her family in a small town called Tursun-zoda. The town was named in honor of the great modern writer Mirzo Tursunzoda. Sayyora is a housewife. She looks after the children and household matters. Her husband is currently unemployed. He helps his wife in her affairs. For many years Sayyora has been keeping livestock in her yard. She helped her parents to work in their livestock yard since early childhood, and started rearing animals at her husband's home. Since her family's circumstances are not the best at the moment and her husband cannot find work, they have decided to develop their livestock business and increase their income. She intends to apply for a loan and to buy a couple of heads of livestock.

their goal. Even if a person has a talent given from above, not everyone can develop it in the right direction. This is the story of the girl in the photograph to whom has been given a big talent. She is called Nasiba and she is 22 years old. Nasiba grew up in a large family. She lives in one house with her parents, two brothers, and their wives and children. Unlike her peers, Nasiba has always known clearly what she will be in the future. God has granted her a wonderful ear and unique voice. Ever since her childhood she has sung, danced and dreamed of becoming a great singer. Her parents support her how they can, but in the small provincial town of J. Rumy she will not be able to achieve her high aims. Now Nasiba works in the same music school where she once studied herself. Nasiba has set herself a goal, and she is going to pursue it faithfully. She will become a singer! She needs funds to realize her dream and begin a career in music. She is going to buy musical instruments, form a group of musicians, and record a video. She believes that she will be noticed sooner or later, and she will catch her star of success."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":404.84,"image":{"id":1869816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical

Renia is the one in the picture who is raising her hand. With the loan from Kiva, she would like to buy more cows for rearing. The profits from the business will be used to increase her savings and to pay school fees of her children and to buy medical insurance.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

With the profits from this coming season, Isain is planning to save more money for the future.\r\n\r\nA total of 4 acres will be planted by Isain's Group, and among them they will receive a total of 10 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1800190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, as well as a solar light.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-05-01T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-31T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isain","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorcus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kenyatta","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mukangi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agneta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":75040,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75040}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-22T00:03:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":875707,"name":"Eddy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eddy es un hombre de 21 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su pareja, tiene un beb\u00e9 de 8 meses, y su negocio es el corte de ladrillos.\n\u00c9l es buen padre, emprendedor, independiente, optimista, generoso, responsable y muy trabajador.

He has a shoemaking business.\r\n\r\nVictor is a good father, and is enterprising, optimistic, independent, responsible and hardworking. His business is located in the residential \u2018Se\u00f1or de Exaltaci\u00f3n\u2019 district on the outskirts of the city. The area is full of adobe houses, some of which have straw roofs. The climate is cold and dry, and the temperature during the day varies between 0-12 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nVictor is olive-skinned, with brown eyes and short black hair. He is short and slim. His mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1, which he speaks with his family. He also speaks Spanish, which he uses in his business. He shares his life with his children. The eldest helps him out with his work and the youngest studies at school. They live in their own home, made of bricks, adobe and cement, with a corrugated iron roof. Their home has drinking water, electricity, gas and a sanitation system.\r\n\r\nVictor has a business making and selling traditional, \"cholita\" shoes. \"Chola\" is the name given to a woman who wears traditional Bolivian clothing, such as a bowler hat, shawl and long skirt. Their shoes, which are flat-heeled and constantly change design, are an important part of their clothing. Victor's work involves putting the soles, insoles, heels and the rest of the shoe together. He does this with the help of his daughter, who sews together and shapes the shoes. Victor explains that \"I began working as a shoemaker's assistant. I learned the trade thoroughly and went independent.\" \r\n\r\nThe advantage of his business is that thanks to his years of experience, he has a lot of regular customers. The disadvantage is that he lacks capital to buy materials. His dream is to expand his workshop and employ assistants to make more shoes. He wants to grow his business by buying shoemaking materials such as soles, fabric, leather, glue and other items.\r\n\r\nThis is his first set of loans with the institution in the 12 years he has spent working as an independent shoemaker. For the reasons given above, Victor is requesting a loan to buy shoemaking materials, employ assistants and increase production.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":472.58,"image":{"id":1866505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy the materials he needs to make shoes, employ assistants and increase production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-05-01T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-31T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":384.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":528.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":551.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":568.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":593.15},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":614.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":654.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":677.89},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":702.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":724.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.13},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.38},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.86},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.47},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.13,"local_amount":384.87,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":387.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046664},{"amount":77.11,"local_amount":528.73,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:25Z","rounded_local_amount":532.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344484},{"amount":80.38,"local_amount":551.2,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":554.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554696},{"amount":82.86,"local_amount":568.2,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":571.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468784},{"amount":87.07,"local_amount":597.05,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":600.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296622},{"amount":89.03,"local_amount":610.52,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:56Z","rounded_local_amount":614.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076819}],"funded_date":"2015-05-08T01:07:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chloe Pilpel","image":1214298}},{"id":875586,"name":"Everline's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Everline is married and has four children.

Eric, from the Chuka area of Kenya, has never secured one and has opted to be a smallholder farmer. He decided that he will be independent and contribute to his community by practicing mixed farming. Eric is blessed with two beautiful children whom he refers to as his \"heart beat.\u201d His primary sources of income are milk and poultry farming, as well as some personal business that he does to supplement his meager income (in the motorbike industry). Deciding to practice poultry farming for Eric was not difficult. For the past five years, Eric has been earning a decent income from poultry farming. However, the demand is overwhelming and he wants to increase his poultry, but the biggest challenge is lack of funds. He is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. Poultry farming has become one of the most important aspects of agriculture in Kenya because it creates business opportunity for entrepreneurs and it is a kind of business that can never dry up. Poultry farming is a less strenuous activity that is profitable. Many poultry farmers find a sense of fulfillment having hens all over their homestead. The hens lay eggs that can be consumed or sold.

With your loan, Samwel will be able to sell cereal to the local market and to his neighbors. This will generate enough income to repay the loan, and he will also be able to save extra money.

Her husband and son are unemployed. The family earns a living with small scale agribusiness. Nino is engaged in cattle breeding and generates a really small income, that is hardly enough for a 3-member family to meet even basic needs. They live in poverty, as having no source of significant income leads to financial difficulties. Nino requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time, because of the low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nHer loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Nino plans to purchase a special tractor for her husband, who will work on private orders and make an income to meet the daily family costs and other expenses. \r\nNino and her family members rely on the goodwill of Kiva lenders and will highly appreciate your support, as the loan is very essential for the family's welfare.

This will allow her to buy ten sheep for fattening up and subsequently sell them at the market for a high price.\r\n\r\nAdinakan plans to invest the finances from the loan in the further increasing of numbers of livestock animals, and intends to save funds in order to carry out wedding celebrations for her son."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":459.93,"image":{"id":1870891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 10 sheep for fattening up and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Sarykandy village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-05-01T20:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-31T20:00:04Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adinakan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3540},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3643},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3749},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3859},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3971},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4087},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4206},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4329},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4455},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4585},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4719},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4857}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.18},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.51},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.74},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.95},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.22},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":122.11,"local_amount":7183,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":7370.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664996164},{"amount":63.73,"local_amount":3749,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:53:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3846.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291587},{"amount":65.6,"local_amount":3859,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3959.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500840},{"amount":66.77,"local_amount":3971,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:06:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4074.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.74,"payment_id":711411774},{"amount":67.28,"local_amount":4087,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.2,"payment_id":730934007},{"amount":66,"local_amount":4206,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:06:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4315.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.5,"payment_id":752026057}],"funded_date":"2015-05-30T22:22:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cheryl Tan","image":null}},{"id":875628,"name":"Gaudence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gaudence is 30 years old.

Their average monthly income is 250-300 GEL. It is hardly enough to buy food for a four-member family. Teimuraz requested a loan from Credo to re-start the business that he had several years ago. His loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides rural poor people business start-up and re-startup credit with soft conditions. These poor people do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. With the received credit, Teimuraz plans to start trading meat. He will have his own counter at the local open market, where the most people go for purchasing food products. Teimuraz will also trade harvested fruits and vegetables and will generate significant income.
