Since sustaining the family and their daily needs is a very hard thing to do, most especially as they have eight children, Rosalinda is working very hard to be able to be good enough in her craft. Aside from this, she also has a food stall where she sells barbecue and other products that help her have additional income on hand. \r\n\r\nBecause food is considered an inevitable need of every individual, the trade Rosalinda has taken up is a very wise choice. Customers are attracted to buy since the price of the food products she sells retail is affordable. \r\n\r\nNow, Rosalinda wants to improve her business more. With an amount of PHP 12,000, she can certainly purchase a larger quantity of raw ingredients that she can use in creating peanut butter and other products she sells. This will surely help her have additional income and profit as well. Ahead of time, Rosalinda wants to thank you for your generosity and sincere kindness. \r\n\r\nAll of us dream. Someday, Rosalinda wants to expand her business. She also prays for more blessings to come and as well as good health to abide in each member of their family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans\r\n  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1866879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a larger quantity of raw ingredients that she can use in making peanut butter and other products she sells.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-05-01T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-05-31T23:00:01Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":128.36,"local_amount":5600,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5674.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017823},{"amount":73.32,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3242.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314238},{"amount":73.32,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3242.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522935}],"funded_date":"2015-05-02T00:06:53Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":875915,"name":"La's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs La, born in 1992, is a Thai ethnic woman.

They are more fond of buying food from stalls along the way just to relieve hunger. And since most families only cook and eat together at home during dinner, it is an wide-open opportunity for entrepreneurs to make food-selling business as their craft.  \r\n\r\nWith this fact, Cecilia is really wanting to cook more recipes, but she doesn't have enough capital. For this reason, she would like to take a loan amounting to 20,000 PHP to buy additional raw products to be displayed on her stall like corn, bananas, eggs and the like. This will become a great help for her in generating an increase in her profit for sure. \r\n\r\nCecilia dreams to build and expand her business to secure the future of his family. She also wants to see her children finish their studies.

To be able to do that, they operate an egg store business. Through this, they are able to earn a good profit from the trade.\r\n\r\nHere, they buy large quantities of eggs and sell them in a retail or wholesale basis to vendors and consumers in the market. Eggs at retail cost a  minimum of PHP 5.00 while eggs per tray are sold at PHP 120 to PHP 200 approximately. They will get an income from this because eggs are highly consumed in the food industry most especially in making pastries and dishes. The same reason is applied for simple homes too. \r\n\r\nThis is why Alan is planning to expand his business. He is requesting a PHP 50000 loan to buy additional supplies of eggs to sell in his store. The bigger supply, the better. This means a larger opportunity to sell and gain money. Alan is truly hoping that your generosity and support will help him enhance and improve his business. \r\n\r\nIn due time, Alan wants to gradually experience progress and have a better living condition. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his life and business every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

His three children are still school-aged and only after finishing their lessons they manage to do some work in the farm with their family. In his farm Vaghinak has a lot of chickens, rabbits and two cows. So he sells a lot of eggs, poultry and rabbit, milk and macun (national dairy-products). Vaghinak also seasonally goes to the Russian Federation to work abroad to enlarge his family income. \n\nHe hopes that Kiva lenders will help him with this loan, which he plans to spend on the purchase of several pigs(he wants to start swine breeding) and also fodder for his farm cattle.

He has a housekeeper wife, little daughter and pensioner grandmother. \r\n\r\nEduard works hard to make good living conditions for his family members. In spite of his high education, Eduard was unable to start a stable job, so in order to earn a living he started private activities. \r\n\r\nIn particular, he is in agribusiness where he is engaged in cattle and pig-breeding, beekeeping, and cultivating agricultural land where he harvests maize and potatoes. He sells his agricultural products at the local market. In addition, he is a private artisan of wood, getting private orders from local people and generating additional income. \r\n\r\nMostly, he is employed with agribusiness and has a great desire to make it wider and start dairy farming.

The Start Up program, a joint product of Kiva and Credo, allows poor people like Tamila to get a chance for starting or restarting a business. Tamila will sell clothing and stationery and make savings for her family's welfare. She awaits your support and kindness. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":186.39,"image":{"id":1867037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To start selling clothing and stationery items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kaspi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2015-05-02T00:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-01T00:10:06Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tamila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":56.68},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":68.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":69.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":71.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75.18},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":76.76},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":80.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":82.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":84.76},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":88.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":90.56},{"due_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":93.9},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96.73},{"due_date":"2016-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":99.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.18},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.71},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.59},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.85},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.61},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.51},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.04},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.79,"local_amount":121.73,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":127.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681391066},{"amount":31.35,"local_amount":68.39,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:05:52Z","rounded_local_amount":71.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696601367},{"amount":31.86,"local_amount":69.52,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":72.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711520711},{"amount":32.93,"local_amount":71.84,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:56:32Z","rounded_local_amount":75.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731036531},{"amount":34.46,"local_amount":75.18,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":78.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752125379}],"funded_date":"2015-05-31T19:49:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":875949,"name":"Lamzira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lamzira is 45 years old and married from the Tskaltubo district.

Her husband works at a building company and gets a fixed salary. As Iamze was unable to start any stable job, she started trading in clothing and sells it door-to-door in order to get her own income. The job is hard for her and she has a great desire to start another more profitable business. Iamze requested a loan from local financial institutions but was approved within the joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions to business start-up credits, which don't have access to regular financial institutions. Iamze has been approved for a loan of 2000 USD and plans to use it to open a store of fruits and vegetables at the local market and get a stable source of income.

So this time, Sargis hopes to receive his Kiva loan in an amount of 400,000 AMD, in order both to pay his elder and smaller daughters\u2019 tuition fees.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":261.9,"image":{"id":1867139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay his elder and smaller daughters\u2019 tuition fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Sevan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2015-05-02T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-01T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sargis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18880},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":20330},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":20570},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":20950},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20820},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":21650},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":21570},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":21730},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":22080},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":22510},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":22610},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":23010},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":23210},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":23390},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":23750},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":24020},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":24280},{"due_date":"2016-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":24640}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.71},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.52},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.01},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.18},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.92},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.83},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.05},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.9},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.32},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.7},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.47},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.04},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.59},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.41,"local_amount":19016.4,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:58:12Z","rounded_local_amount":19152.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665190182},{"amount":43.5,"local_amount":20469.9,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T16:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":20616.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681496696},{"amount":43.17,"local_amount":20313.3,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20458.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696703309},{"amount":44.81,"local_amount":21085.4,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T17:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":21236.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711635334},{"amount":44.54,"local_amount":20960.8,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":21110.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731140477},{"amount":45.47,"local_amount":21397.9,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":21551.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752227379}],"funded_date":"2015-05-07T13:06:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":876080,"name":"Eliza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eliza is a 29 year old woman with three children, two of which are in school.

The only breadwinner is Rada, who is involved in private trading at the local market. Her salary, however, isn't enough to meet all daily costs and Viktor wants to make his bit for the family's welfare. He sought  credit among the local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses.

The family has a very poor living condition, as they don't have any source of income and live in poverty. Iuri can't find any job and wants to start his own business, in order to satisfy his family's even basic needs. He has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time because of the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nFinally his loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.

She is 40 years of age with five children. Her husband, Celso, works as an electrician and they work hand-in-hand to provide for their needs. \r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nJudith wants to improve her business. But due to financial insufficiency, she would like to avail a loan of 16,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional raw products like pork, chicken and seasonings that are needed for her barbecue store. Having a positive perspective, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nJudith dreams of building and expanding her business to secure the future of her family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1867431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She works in the \"16 de julio\" neighborhood, popular for its trade and manufacturing businesses in every area, as well as for its traditional market on Thursdays and Sundays, where you can find from a pin to a tractor.

The oldest one attends school and the youngest already knows how to walk. They live in a house property of her mother and built with adobe, brick and cement with the ceiling made of corrugated iron. They have drinking water, electric energy, gas and sewage system. She sells educational toys for babies and children of all ages. She has a fixed stand at the market every Thursday and Sunday during the day. \"I started my business thanks to the help of my mother-in-law and I've been working in it for 2 years\", she says. The advantage she has is that she has been able to get regular clients; her disadvantage is that her stand is outdoors and her toys are exposed to the weather, including sun and rain. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to open a toy store.

She is single and does not have any children. She works as a restaurant cashier. She is independent, intelligent, responsible, and very hard-working. She does bookkeeping at a barbecue place in the area of Sacaba, located 14 kilometers from the city. The farmers taht live here cultivate the land in this tropic region and sell their harvest in the city. There's a moderate climate with the temperature varying between 18 and 25 \u00b0C [64 - 77 \u00b0F] during the day.\r\n\r\nFabiola is olive-skinned, has long brown hair, which she wears tied back, is of medium height, and has a thin physique. Her native language is Quechua, and she also speaks Spanish on a daily basis and at work.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her grandfather and her two younger siblings because her parents are working in Italy. They live in her grandfather's partially completed house, made of bricks and cement, with electricity and well water, using an electrical pump.\r\n\r\nShe works as a bookkeeper at a restaurant. At the same time she studies accountancy in her fourth year in university. She says: \"I study and work to finish the constructions of my family's house and equip it with the basic commodities...\" The advantage of her work is that it is at night, so she has all day to study. The downside is that some extra classes are overlapping with her work schedule.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a profession and a stable job, so she can help her family, and to install drinking water in her grandfather's house, so they can stop using the dirty and unfiltered water from the well.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan she will receive from the institution in the two and a half years in which she has been working and studying. For these reasons, Fabiola is requesting a loan to install potable water in her bathroom, kitchen, and laundry room to be able to stop drinking dirty water from the

Su Trabajo lo realiza en la comunidad \u2018Tundy\u2019 ubicado a 25 kil\u00f3metros al sur este de la ciudad, los lugare\u00f1os se dedican principalmente a labores agropecuarias, los j\u00f3venes y ni\u00f1os pasan r\u00e1pidamente a un espacio laboral para poder apoyar a sus familias, dejando truncados sus estudios. Normalmente los trabajos que desempe\u00f1an est\u00e1n relacionados a labores en los chacos, cuidado de ganado y ni\u00f1eras o ayudante de alba\u00f1iles en la ciudad. Estas condiciones est\u00e1n enmarcadas como trabajos riesgosos y llevan a los ni\u00f1os, ni\u00f1as y adolescentes a posibles situaciones de explotaci\u00f3n laboral.\nMarivel es de tez morena, ojos pardos, cabello largo negro lo usa amarrado, estatura mediana, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica mediana, su lengua materna es el Guaran\u00ed que se habla en el lugar y en el comercio mayormente habla espa\u00f1ol (la primera de la izquierda, fila de atr\u00e1s, viste solera rosa y sostiene a su hijo en brazos). La necesidad de cubrir los gastos de su hijo la llev\u00f3 a formar una banca de personas con negocios como; venta de comida, venta de verduras, venta de ropa de segunda mano, venta de desayunos, venta de bisuter\u00eda, venta de cosm\u00e9ticos, servicio de transporte y centro de llamadas, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo para mejorar sus actividades. Su negocio es la venta de alimentos y art\u00edculos de primera necesidad como; pan, az\u00facar fideo, arroz, refrescos, galletas, productos de limpieza, etc., en su tienda de barrio que debido a la falta de comercio en el \u00e1rea no tiene mucha competencia.

Su sue\u00f1o es abrir una empresa distribuidora para realizar ventas por mayor, ella desea ampliar su negocio realizando la compra por mayor de abarrotes y material escolar para la venta en su tienda, ya que existe una escuela cercana y existe demanda de esos productos. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 3 a\u00f1os que se dedica a esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Marivel solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de abarrotes y material escolar para surtir su tienda y con los beneficios pagar los gastos preescolares de su hijo.\n","en":"Marivel is a 28-year-old woman, single, who has a 5-year-old son, and her business is selling food and basic products in her neighborhood store. \r\n\r\nShe is enterprising, optimistic, has a positive attitude, is dedicated to her work, generous, friendly, responsible and very hard-working. Her work is located in the Tundy community, located 25 kilometers to the southeast of the city. The local people work primarily in agricultural work, the young people and children enter the workplace quickly to be able to support their family, cutting their education short. Normally, the work that they do is related to work in the farms, taking care of cattle, and as babysitters or bricklayer assistants in the city. These conditions are classified as dangerous work and bring the children and adolescents into possible situations of work exploitation. \r\n\r\nMarivel has dark skin, dark eyes, long black hair that she keeps tied up, is of medium stature, medium physique, her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks in the place and in business she primarily speaks Spanish (she is the first one on the left in the back row, she is wearing a pink tank top and has her son in her arms). The need to cover her son's expenses brought her to form a bank of people with businesses such as food sales, vegetable sales, second-hand clothing sales, breakfast sales, costume jewelry sales, cosmetic sales, transportation service, and a call center, to ask for a loan to improve their businesses.  Her business is selling food and basic items such as bread, sugar, beans, rice, soft drinks, cookies, cleaning products, etc., in her neighborhood store which, due to the lack of business in the area, doesn't have much competition. She does the work independently every day of the week during the day. \"My business gives me the opportunity to see my son grow and to be with him all the time...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she can care for her son, the disadvantage is the distance of her suppliers to her store. Her dream is to open a distribution business to make bulk sales. She wants to expand her business, purchasing groceries in bulk and school supplies to sell in her store, since there is a school nearby and there is demand for these products. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the three years that she has been doing this work. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Marivel asks for a loan to purchase groceries and school supplies to stock her store and, with the profits, pay her son's preschool expenses.

is a strong woman. She was born in the northern part of Tajikistan in 1977. She is living in a small village near mountains with poor water but a fresh and pretty atmosphere close to nature. She is married and has six children. Because her family is big, she and her husband need to work together. \r\n\r\nIn order to start a business, Mutabar appealed to IMON and participated to training for startup clients.

He owns a one acre piece of land where he stays and works. His family is composed of him, his wife and 3 children, aged between 19 and 27.\r\n \r\nFor 36 years, Hosea has been farming for a living. Currently, he owns 2 cows named Queen and Kadogo (informal Swahili word meaning 'little'). This year, Hosea is planning to grow the number of stock and expand the cowshed.

a smallholder farmer from the Kisii area of Kenya, is passionate about dairy farming. He started dairy farming 20 years ago and still carries on today on his 2.5 acre farmland located next to a river. Currently he owns 4 dairy cows, 40 heads of poultry and has planted approximately 5,000 trees.\r\n \r\nStill feeling plenty of youthful energy, Kennedy knows he can do more. He is therefore seeking a loan to purchase an additional dairy cow. Increasing the number of cows and employing the best modern techniques for feeding and health management are the only ways a dairy farmer can increase his farm's productivity and hence income.\r\n \r\nKennedy will use the increased income generated from his investment with your loan to improve his family's welfare and his children's education. Kennedy's family is composed of his wife, Margaret, and 5 children aged between 3 and 15. Tuition expenses are his highest annual cost.

investing in a venture and reaping nothing at the end of the day. This is the sad story of Noah, a youthful 40-year-old Mzee (old man) - a wise farmer whose neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. He farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills near Eldoret in the northern Rift \r\nValley region of Kenya. \r\n\r\nNoah's farming experience dates back to 2005. Like many other farmers in the region, maize is a staple crop which he has been planting for as long as he can remember. With time, the fertility of his land has started to dwindle and whenever he plants maize, the yields decrease with each cropping season. Noah has also had a problem with weeds. \r\n\r\nToday he is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy fertilizers, pesticides and good quality seeds. Through this loan, he is going to increase his crop production and this will translate into an improved level of income. This loan will permanently change his standard of living, and he thinks there is no doubt that one can find rewarding employment in farming.\r\n\r\nIf there is a smallholder farmer that you should consider lending to, then that farmer is Noah. Kindly help him out!\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1867587,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy fertilizers, pesticides and good quality seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-02T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-01T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3693.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3928.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4042.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4161.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4282.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4407.85},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4536.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4669.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4805.71},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4946.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5090.71},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5239.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5392.61},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5550.2},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5712.41},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5879.35},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6051.18},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6228.02},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6410.04},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6597.37},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6790.18},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6988.62},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7192.86},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7403}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.47},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.86},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.28},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.27},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.82},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.43},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.07},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.77},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.52},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.32},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.17},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.07},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.03},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.05},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.13},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.26},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.46},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sally Otway","image":1443524}},{"id":876320,"name":"Levelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Levelyn works hard to support her family.

Edwin will also be able to get more cow dung for manure and fuel. With your loan, he will kill two birds with one stone: increased milk production and reduced costs. This will greatly boost his profit margin and thus his income. \r\n\r\nWhen asked, \"How will this loan benefit your family?\" Edwin replied, \"My family will get food and more income and thus better

With the sheep, he will get additional income from selling wool and mutton. The new products will also help him mitigate the business risk of offering only a single product. The fence will help control sheep movement because, unlike cows, sheep are extremely mobile. He is afraid of losing his stock, so the fence will prevent them from straying into the forest neighboring his farm. \r\n\r\nHe hopes the investment will bring enough return to uplift his family's livelihood.

At age 33, he spends every day of the week, Monday through Sunday, in his mixed farm, tirelessly working. James is, one of the most hardworking and dedicated men on planet earth. He is based in Kahuhia, a remote village in the Thika area of Kenya. He is happily married to Mercy, who adds additional income to support their family. They are blessed with two lovely children. For the past 20 years he has been engaged in mixed farming, and through selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops he has earned a decent income. Like many farmers in his village, he also plants trees on his farm to complement the region's natural forests. Although James makes profits selling his farm produce at the market, the biggest challenge he faces is lack of water to irrigate his farm and water for home consumption. James comes from an area where there is no water connection and he is always forced to walk for a long distance for this \u201cprecious commodity.\" James faces challenges carrying water on his back because of his failing health. \r\n\r\nJames is seeking a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the farmers in Kenya depend on rain-fed agriculture but James wants to change that notion and start irrigation farming. Through the loan he intends to harvest rain water (which always goes to waste) and store it in the tank. He intends to buy pipes that will be used to pump water from the river directly to his farm. With your loan, James will be saved the trouble of walking a long distance in search of water, and he will have enough water for home consumption. Irrigating his farm will boost productivity since water is an important requirement in the germination of crops. James is very excited about this project and hopes his dream will be achieved through the loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders. Increased productivity means increased income and this will translate to improved living standards. He will use the additional income to improve and secure the future of his children.

Joel lives with his beautiful wife in Kapsowar, a small rural town in Kenya. The Kapsowar area is also referred to as the mango region of Kenya because half the mangoes consumed are from that region. He has been farming for the past five years and has never looked back. To earn a decent and honest living, he sells milk, eggs, and a variety of food crops. <br \/><br \/>Joel is satisfied with the returns he gets through farming. However, he wants to diversify and start horticulture farming. The main challenge he faces is accessing funds. He is kindly requesting a loan to start horticulture farming.
