Johnbosco hopes that the financial assistance from UGAFODE will enable him to expand his business and open more outlets to increase his income."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1867730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy crates of soda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2015-05-02T20:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-01T20:30:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johnbosco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2016-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2016-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":876491,"name":"Greda Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greda is a group consisting of six members, of whom four are men and two are women.

Presumably, this is the country's national transportation. Jeepneys provide a living for ordinary people like the drivers. Here is Jogie, 46, a resident of Batasan, Quezon City. She has six children and she is only one of many who oversee the operation of Jeepney units in the country. Her income from the business is a great aid for her family's daily expenses and demands.  \r\n\r\nShe has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) Jeepney, from which she is paid a *boundary (daily quota) each day. Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and to maintain.\r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the Jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\nJogie is requesting a PHP 21,000 loan to buy spare parts and maintain her Jeepney unit. She will use the profit to improve the general living condition of her family.\r\n\r\nIn due time, she hopes that her business will be continuously operating and growing through adding more units of jeepneys. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and business every week and draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1867792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To buy spare parts and maintain her Jeepney unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-05-02T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-01T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jogie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":190.02,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:55:13Z","rounded_local_amount":8402.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017834},{"amount":126.68,"local_amount":5600,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":5601.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314249},{"amount":158.3,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7002.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522946}],"funded_date":"2015-05-03T02:40:01Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":876522,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":55,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a dairy cow for milk production so as to meet the demand of her customers for milk supply.

Meet Dorothy, an ever-smiling young farmer from Nandi hills County in Kenya who has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture that it is for the older generation. She is a proud owner of a small parcel of land on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. Her primary sources of income are selling eggs and milk, and through this venture, she has earned a decent income. She also engages in personal business in order to make ends meet. Dorothy passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cow. \r\n\r\nAlthough this humble woman has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. Dorothy is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This will help fully satisfy the demand. Through Juhudi Kilimo, which is a field partner, she attended training sessions and was taught the best financial management skills. This will help her save more money to repay the loan fully and to improve her living conditions. Kindly help her out!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":201.4,"image":{"id":1867794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

His only son currently serves in the army. \r\n\r\nDavid always knew he wanted to start his own business, to provide for his family normal living conditions and achieve their dreams. So since 2005, David has been running his own grocery store in the center of Spitak town. The products in his store are always fresh, and people enjoy their shopping because of his nice attitude towards them. \r\n\r\nDavid has now applied for this loan to ask lenders for support to purchase food and drink supplies for selling in the store.  He had previously taken a loan from a local financial institution, but wasn't able to repay it.

Hayk\u2019s farm is rather famous in the village because of the meat he sells. He sells beef, pork, mutton and poultry mainly by order, since he has a lot of customers and sometimes the orders are so large that he hardly manages to cover all of them.\r\n\r\nHis farm\u2019s meat is always fresh and clean, as well as his farm\u2019s milk, macun (national dairy product), cheese, curd and eggs that his wife sells. Hayk asks for a loan of 700,000 AMD because he has plans of enlarging his farm. With the loan he is going to buy two calves for his farm and also enough fodder for his farm cattle.

He will be happy to have this loan as his tractor needs to be repaired and he must buy some new spare parts for it."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":224.82,"image":{"id":1867922,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to repair his tractor and to buy some new spare parts for it","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Gegharkunik region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2015-05-03T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-02T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gagik","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":16200},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":17230},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":17520},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":17640},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":17940},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18100},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":18820},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":18740},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":19930},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":20040},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":20110},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":20670},{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":20880},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":21240},{"due_date":"2016-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":21640},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":21920},{"due_date":"2016-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":22380}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.72},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.16},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.94},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.09},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.29},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.74},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.51},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.37},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.97},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.31,"local_amount":16479.5,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":16736.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665190188},{"amount":36.47,"local_amount":17017.5,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T16:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":17283.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681496702},{"amount":37.49,"local_amount":17497.2,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":17770.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696703315},{"amount":37.76,"local_amount":17621,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T17:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":17896.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711635340},{"amount":38.39,"local_amount":17914.8,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":18194.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731140483},{"amount":39.4,"local_amount":18385.8,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":18673.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752227385}],"funded_date":"2015-05-23T08:57:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":876586,"name":"Jelliah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jelliah is 59 years old, married, and she supports six family members.

The rugs she makes range from round palm sized ones to the much larger doormats. As rugs and brooms are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, these are the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1500 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nRoxanne is taking out a PHP 35,000 loan to buy raw supplies and materials needed in making more rugs. She will be also utilizing the loan to buy more broom reeds to increase her product inventory.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Roxanne hopes that she will have her own space to store all her products and which will also serve as her workplace for making rugs. She also looks forward to seeing their lives prosper. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She sells milk, eggs, and maize, and when she is not farming, she engages in some personal business to help supplement the meager income she earns. However, despite the meager earnings, farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction. \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products, because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" she says. Although she earns profits through farming Nandihills has one problem and that is low supply of cereals. Mercy wants to capitalize on this and be a large cereal supplier. She is kindly requesting for a loan to buy cereals for resale. Through the loan she will be able to satisfy the market and this will improve her income levels.

They live side by side, forming a place for business and all areas of manufacturing. The lands in this area are predominantly composed of sand, some fine and others muddy. The climate is warm, with a temperature that varies between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n\r\nMelfy has tan skin, brown eyes, and long black hair that she wears tied back. She is short of stature, with a robust build. Her maternal language is Spanish, and she speaks Guaran\u00ed by family heritage. She is seated in the center, wearing a black blouse and skirt.  She shares her life with her partner, a businessman, and her children, who are studying in school. They live in their own house, made of brick and cement, with a corrugated iron roof. It has potable water, electricity, and a sewer system.\r\n\r\nHer need to succeed was the reason that she brought together a bank of persons with similar needs and businesses, such as sales of cell phone covers, coca leaf, quinoa juice, perfume, soft drinks, skirts, and ice cream. Their purpose is to request a loan and improve their businesses. \r\n\r\nHer business is baking, mostly salte\u00f1as and tamales. Salte\u00f1as are a type of empanada\u2014juicy, and filled with beef or chicken, hard-boiled egg, spices, and other ingredients, and cooked in the oven. They are a traditional popular cuisine, and are served mid-morning.  In the afternoon, she is busy selling tamales, which are baked ground corn, with cheese, peppers and sweets. These are customarily eaten in the afternoon, accompanied by a cup of coffee. \u201cI learned to bake through heritage. I know other recipes, but for the moment, these two are going well for me\u2026\u201d she says. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is the people\u2019s custom of eating both foods; the disadvantage is the lack of capital for the purchase of wholesale cooking supplies in order to increase production. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a large, well-stocked bakery. She wants to purchase different flours (wheat, corn, rice, etc.) at wholesale, in order to increase her production and improve her income. This is the second loan cycle in the one year that she has been an independent baker. \r\n\r\nThat is why Melfy is requesting a loan for the purchase of wholesale flour to increase her production and reach more customers, thus improving her income. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5075,"image":{"id":1866725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase flour at wholesale, in order to increase her production and reach more customers, thus improving her income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-05-03T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-02T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":5075,"lender_count":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guido","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melfy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norah Margot","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":5075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2301.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2252.71},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2293.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2335.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2344.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2451.13},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2465.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2485.98},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2576.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2602.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2649.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2697.82},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2746.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2796.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.76},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":326.64},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":332.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.64},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.94},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.41},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":360.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.56},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":377.32},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":384.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":398.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":405.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2026.98,"local_amount":13979.2,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":13986.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344488},{"amount":1091.49,"local_amount":7527.46,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":7531.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554700},{"amount":761.51,"local_amount":5251.82,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":5254.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468788},{"amount":789.49,"local_amount":5444.74,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5447.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296626},{"amount":405.53,"local_amount":2796.78,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2798.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076822}],"funded_date":"2015-06-02T01:15:18Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanora Brennan","image":null}},{"id":876548,"name":"Ana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana, who is 25 years old young woman, lives in Kutaisi city.

He is requesting a loan to pay for his education expenses. This is his story: \"My name is Rafael. I am 18 years old and I have three siblings. I am single, without children. I live with my maternal grandfather, because my mother died when I was born, and ever since then, my grandparents have raised me up. Currently, I am studying Systems Engineering at the \"Universidad O&M\". I chose this career, because since I was very young, I always liked technology and I saw myself getting better every day, and to the point of wanting to be part of the next generation of persons who would change the world. Currently, I am in my first four month semester of college. My favorite courses are \"Introduction to Computers\" and \"Introduction to Mathematics\". I am requesting this loan for my studies, because at my level, it is difficult to find a job and progress academically. My father has another family to support and currently, he does not have a regular job; therefore, my student life has become more complicated. This loan would help me achieve my dream; it would be a boost for me. I do not want to stop studying at any time. Therefore, I am requesting your help to be able to become professional. My objective is to prepare myself and achieve my greatest possible academic average. I want to work in a big company. I want to be an example of achieving what one really wants, and that anyone can overcome obstacles. I want to help my grandfather and my whole family.\""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1866760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for higher education expenses.

Imeda developed fruit and citrus growing and works hard to provide financial stability for his parents. However, as he gets only seasonal income and finds it hard to tackle the financial difficulties, Imeda decided to become involved in another activity and do his best for his family's welfare. \r\n\r\nThe startup program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables the rural poor to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of $2,500 for purchasing a secondhand car and start providing taxi service. He will serve local people and will generate a daily income, which will help him satisfy the increased needs of his family.\r\n \r\nImeda relies on the goodwill of Kiva lenders and will be very thankful for the chance to live in better conditions.

story: \r\n\r\n\"My name is Leudy and I am 18 years old. At the moment I am living in a rural area of Santiago de los Caballeros. I was born and lived the first 14 years of my life in the countryside in a place called Jacagua Adentro which is north of Santiago in the northern mountain range of the Dominican Republic. \r\n\r\nI have two brothers who are both older than me and I'm not married nor do I have children. At the moment, I live with my parents. My father works and my mother is a housewife. \r\n\r\nI am studying medicine at the Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Santiago (UTESA), and I have chosen this degree because I long to be a doctor so I can help other people. I started studying 4 months' ago and I have taken subjects like Foundation Spanish Language, Foundation Maths, Research Methodology, Guidance and Laboratory, which is my favourite. \r\n\r\nAt present, my family can't afford to continue paying for my studies which is why we are requesting a loan because otherwise, I will have to suspend my studies. This loan will help us a lot because it will help me to continue moving forward with my studies. \r\n\r\nIn my family we long for the day in which we become professionals. My goal is to be a doctor so I can help people in need and, on a personal level, so I can start a foundation to help poor children. At the moment, I give my all to my studies every day. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing my degree I hope to get a job in a hospital or clinic in the healthcare sector so I can put my knowledge to good use.\"

When the piglets are sold, their owners share in the profits, which are divided 60\/40 or 70\/30 depending on their agreement. However, Leonora has a desire to earn more money and has now decided to raise pigs on her own as well. \r\n\r\nThrough Pauglam PC, she has already obtained the capital to purchase her own piglets and feed for them. Now, she is requesting a loan of 14,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) to buy additional piglets and feed. She really hopes and prays that her business will grow and benefit her family, adding to her husband's income. Someday, she wants to build a concrete pig pen to easily keep her pigs in more sanitary conditions.

Helping the family survive, she never gets tired of tending her little store. Fortunately, her store is located in a populous neighborhood and she makes promising daily sales. Perla keeps on running the store well even though there is increased competition from other stores. She believes that with the support of her family, they will sustain and beat the competition. \r\n\r\nPerla is now trying to expand her resources and has decided to establish a chicken and pork barbecue vending business for added income. She presented her project proposal to Paglaum MPC for financing of the project.

All in all her monthly income averages around 17,000 som (KGS). In order to expand her business, Aitolkun applied for a loan of 125,000 som (KGS) with Bai Tushum Bank to increase her livestock headcount through the purchase of 15 sheep and to buy fertilizers for her crops.

She is a fisherwoman.\r\nShe is an entrepreneur, patient, constant, independent, responsible, and very hard-working. She runs her business in \u2018Puerto P\u00e9rez\u2019 on the shore of the sacred Lake Titicaca. This is one of the most beautiful and mysterious parts of America. The community has a church and an education centre. Soon, it will have running water. The climate is cold and dry with a temperature that varies during the day between 0 and 12 degrees celsius. \r\nAdela is dark-skinned, with brown eyes and long black hair which she wears in a braid. She is short and of average build and dresses traditionally (hat, traditional skirt, and sweater). Her mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1. She speaks this language with her family and speaks Spanish for her business and due to the general culture. She shares her life with her family members who are farmers. They live in their own adobe home with a corrugated iron roof. Their home has electricity and well-water that they extract with an electric pump. \r\nAdela's business is fishing. The most common types of fish in the area are: mauri, ispi, carachi, pejerrey and trout. \"Fishing in the lake is seasonal. The fishing season is about to end, so we work in farming\", she says. The advantage of her business is that she has several years' experience and knows the work well. The challenge is the seasons.

Trading charcoal and cattle from KomPong Chnang to Phnom Penh, they run their business very well. However, getting up early to prepare products on the car to bring to Phnom Penh is their daily workload. Pov and his wife need a lot of energy to generate light day and night, but his current energy solution (a car battery) is not reliable. Some of the time, a car battery works well.

Through her earnings she is able to send her children to school and meet their daily living expense. Aside from her general store, she also has a tricycle for transportation service.\r\n\r\nShe would now like to apply for a 30,000 PHP loan, which she will use as part of her working capital to buy more grocery items like rice, coffee, soda, rice noodles and frozen foods, which she sells at retail. Part of the loan she will use for the maintenance of her tricycle unit. Her income from her store and tricycle service is a stable source to sustain her family's basic needs and for the education of her children. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. \r\n\r\nRegina hopes to sustain and grow her two businesses to give her family a better life. She aims to give her children the best education possible, to allow them better opportunities in life.

He also offers a one-year warranty for each product. Most of his female customers purchase home appliances for making dowry for their daughters. Nowadays, the demand for LCD televisions has increased in the market.

Sari-sari means \"variety.\" As such, they provide people with products mostly needed in everyday survival -- from products for personal hygiene, such as shampoo, toothpaste and powder, to condiments, foods, canned goods and other low-cost items. This is why many of those who want to go into business often start as a sari-sari vendor: With a little capital, you can automatically operate a store and earn an income. \r\n\r\nThat was the case for Petronila, 68, from Caloocan City, in Metro Manila. She became involved in this kind of business 30 years ago. Through all those years, she was able to provide for her four children through her income from the store. What she does is basically buy products in large quantities, then display them in her store and sell them at retail, often at a price that is affordable for her customers but higher than the original price so she can make a profit. \r\n\r\nOne cannot expect a regular and stable income from this business, since sales vary from time to time. For this reason, Petronila is requesting a loan of  20,000 Philippine pesos to buy more products to display in her store.

Since Palestinians have limited access to many working sectors in Lebanon, she and her husband were forced to work in agriculture and tend to their crops. \r\n\r\nEight years ago she started her own business, to increase her income and develop her living.
