Her tenacity and perseverance have allowed her to get ahead and overcome various obstacles that have presented themselves along the way. \r\n\r\nFifteen years ago she started farming. Over the years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops, and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. \r\n\r\nEucabeth is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. \r\n\r\nKenya's Nyamira area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals.  Eucabeth could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Eucabeth, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing.  Eucabeth believes this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. \r\n\r\nShe also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Eucabeth to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children.

She is a smallholder farmer based in Gitareni village in Central Kenya. \r\n\r\nShe owns a one-acre piece of land where she grows different varieties of crops and keeps poultry. She has also planted over 400 trees on it for aesthetic appearance and environmental health. Not only does the land provide her with capital for her business but also with a home for her family. She is blessed to have eight children with her husband, to whom she has stayed married for 45 years! \r\n\r\nMilka is seeking a loan to purchase cereals. The cereals she is seeking serve to replenish her stock for food and business. The demand for cereals in Chuka, only a few kilometers from Milka's home, is rising. Farmers in the area are rushing to grow more cereal crops. \r\n\r\nBy placing herself in a position of supplying cereal seeds and still being a cereal farmer, she will enjoy profits from selling inputs and crop harvests.

rural town in Kenya. Today, this humble mother of four children sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has about farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. \r\n\r\nAlthough she makes a profit through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit so she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit and to purchase more poultry. Through the loan she will have an easier time milking her cow and feeding. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and prevents them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Increased poultry will allow her to satisfy the ready market for eggs that is in her village. Alice believes that through this loan, her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk and egg production. She will save the money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

Luc\u00eda has been sewing for more than four years.  She is a single mother with a child who she supports through her work as a seamstress at a tailoring shop.  In addition, she works independently by taking on sporadic jobs.  Sra. Luc\u00eda does not have a steady income since she only receives payment for her finished work.  She has an obvious drive to succeed, as demonstrated by the effort she made to obtain sewing training at the Center for Training at the Bolivian Red Cross and from the General Directorate for Adult Services through the Department of Education in order to hone her skills.  <br \/><br \/>With her skills perfected, Sra. Luc\u00eda plans to become independent and establish her own sewing workshop.  On this occasion, she needs assistance and is requesting a loan in order to buy fabrics and a sewing machine.  This will help her to increase her earnings and eventually improve the quality of life for herself and her child."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":583.38,"image":{"id":1866703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

She is 50-years old and is ethnically Mayagnan.  Saraina works as a teacher in a primary school.  Because of the difficulties she had in not having any collateral, she joined a communal bank for three years.  This gave her access to a loan.  Now that her income is improving and she has acquired assets, such as electrical appliances, she can put up a guarantee on her loan.  As such Saraina has separated from her communal bank and is requesting her first individual loan.  She wants to install windows and doors in her stilted house made of wood.

He has four children all going to school and he is living in a typical pastralist rural setting where he does cattle rearing and trading to earn income to meet his family obligations.\r\n\r\nDespite the many cows, Steven has always lived in a grass thatched house because it had been the tradition. He was excited when a fellow cattle keeper started building a permanent house and when Steven inquired, the friend told him he had gotten a loan from UGAFODE. \r\n\r\nSteven also decided to borrow so that he can build a permanent house from the proceeds of the cattle trade. He is however challenged by the long droughts that affect the productivity of the cows.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting this loan to purchase more cows to fatten and later to sell. He said that his clients are traders from his village and those from the nearby villages.\r\n\r\nHis hope for the future is to enlarge his cattle business and build a permanent house to provide decent housing for his household.

Therefore she has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her to purchase these accessories and help her to increase monthly sales and profit by providing better sewing services.

However, due to financial constraints, he is not in a suitable position to buy all these products. Therefore Asma has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her husband to buy all these commodities and to earn the maximum profitable income to manage his household and business. Asma is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1868812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is a passionate farmer and, because of her immense knowledge of farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow, and that makes her very proud. \r\n\r\nAlthough she makes a profit through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit, and she is seeking a loan to build one. She is also seeking a loan to buy poultry birds. The Nyamira area is very populated and the demand for eggs is very high. Through the dairy unit, she will have a humble time milking and feeding her cow. \r\n\r\nA good dairy unit provides a sheltering place where cows can relax, and it also helps to protect them from the diseases that may arise if they are exposed to harsh weather conditions, such as rain. Damaris believes that through the loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk and egg production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit and also to satisfy the ready poultry market in Nyamira.\r\n \r\nDamaris waits for your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":313.09,"image":{"id":1868787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To construct a modern dairy unit and buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-04T00:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-03T00:10:04Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.59,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Damaris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.73},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.62},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.68},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.92},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.62},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.76,"local_amount":10039.78,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":10251.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378618},{"amount":97.32,"local_amount":9130,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":9322.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.59,"payment_id":711506594},{"amount":105.42,"local_amount":9731.19,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:48Z","rounded_local_amount":9935.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111582}],"funded_date":"2015-05-09T12:42:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":877244,"name":"Sanoat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sanoat is a hardworking woman.

She is the mother of three children and she has to face a lot of problems to feed all of them in a day and to fulfill all the household expenses. Ayesha's husband is the sole earner who has to provide for all the household expenses through a single source of income, a computer accessories shop. He sells computer accessories such as mice, keyboards, monitors, sound cards, graphics cards, pen drives, etc. It is a challenge for him to sell his products in the market where is a lot of competition.\r\n\r\nWith the gradual increase in household expenses, Ayesha's husband wants to grow his income, as well. Therefore, Ayesha has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband could  buy more computer accessories for his shop. Ayesha hopes that this loan will prove a productive one for business and for her family also. Ayesha is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

Khatija is also providing sewing services and earns an income to contribute, with her husband, to manage the household. \r\n\r\nShe needs different kinds of goods: e.g needles, threads, pieces of cloth, machine oil etc for her business purposes. But due to insufficient financial means, she is unable to purchase these accessories. Therefore she has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her to purchase these accessories and also be helpful for her to increase monthly sales and profit by providing better sewing services.\r\n\r\nKhatija is very thankful to Kiva

She is dedicated and responsible, and knows how to use her skills as a farmer. Although a humble woman, she is creative and knows how to make the most of opportunities. She lives in Ekerenyo, a remote village in Nyamira area of Kenya. She is happily married and is blessed with four adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last four years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Nyamira area is very populated, so demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable. She stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, so she is seeking a loan of KES 20,000 to buy poultry. Being a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and extend her poultry market to other markets. This will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying the loan, permanently changing her living conditions, and securing the future of her school-going children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":104.85,"image":{"id":1868862,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She makes a living doing mixed farming in Lessos village, located in the Nandi hills area of Kenya. She keeps dairy cows and poultry for commercial milk and eggs respectively. \r\n\r\nBesides mixed farming, Philister is also very concerned about the health of the environment. She spends most of her time working on her farm. Philister is seeking a KES 10,000 loan to purchase farm implements. These tools will make the work on her farm move much faster and easier. Tending to her farm involves a lot of digging, uprooting, planting and packaging. There are various tools in the market that are handy for a woman in her line of work.

She buys and sells her livestock at the same local market.  Her profits will enable her to pay for healthcare, food and clothing for her children.  She has had no problems with her loan from RMCR and she relies on them to support her in her livestock and agriculture business.  This will help her provide for herself and her family.
