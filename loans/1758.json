The idea to start their own business came about, as her husband worked for 6 years at another tortilla business in the community.  There, he learned everything necessary to manage his own, and decided to begin his business.  \"We accomplished it with effort, savings, and working as a team\" they say.  \r\n\r\nRoc\u00edo offers their products directly in her business, but also has two delivery-people who takes the tortillas to homes.  In this case, she prepares, weighs, and packages the tortillas.  Roc\u00edo is very enthusiastic about the earning, as she was able to open a grocery store while continuing to maintain the tortilla business and buy furniture for her home. \r\n\r\nWith the opportunity for this loan,  Ch\u00edo will invest in bags of flour to continue her business.  She also plans to expand her tortilla business and acquire another machine, which will benefit the community as it would create jobs for two more deliver-people.   \r\n\r\nEl Regreso is thankful for the confidence obtained from being able to acquire a loan and support growth.  \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in the grocery store.

After time the business grew and with the profits she was able to buy shelves to exhibit her products, mainly rice, beans, soup and canned goods. With the profits she also helped her parents with the household expenses.  <br \/><br \/>At the same time Vanessa felt a deep passion for teaching which led her to study education in a private school. Unfortunately she had to discontinue these studies due to a family health problem. However her determination has allowed her to serve her community and doing this she got a scholarship to continue her studies. <br \/><br \/>Vanessa is content as the grocery store is bearing fruit and she is continuing her academic development. At this time she will use the loan she is requesting to buy oil, rice, beans, sugar, corn, cheese, toilet paper, detergent and soft drinks as this is the merchandise most requested by her clients. <br \/><br \/>The entire group expresses their gratitude with these words, \" Thanks for having confidence in us. With each one of the loans we have been able to achieve our goals\". The photograph was taken at the house of the son of Angelina. Vanessa is wearing a brown blouse and printed shorts."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":1866608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy oil, rice, beans, sugar, corn, cheese, toilet paper, detergent and soft drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acatlan de Perez, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-05-04T16:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-03T16:40:05Z","loan_amount":3775,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Aracely ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aidee ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Primitiva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanessa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Santa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":58000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":471.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":471.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":471.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":471.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":471.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":471.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":471.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":471.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1415.64,"local_amount":21750,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":21767.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597628},{"amount":943.75,"local_amount":14500,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:20:38Z","rounded_local_amount":14511.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682141019},{"amount":1158.03,"local_amount":17792.24,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":17806.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768153},{"amount":257.58,"local_amount":3957.76,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3960.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701209}],"funded_date":"2015-05-04T23:07:47Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T19:35:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":877775,"name":"Amalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amalia is a mother of five children, but three are married already.

school.  He has sold  second hand clothes for three years and works from 7am to 6pm daily.  He is able to make a fair monthly profit.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Donard's 2nd loan with Tujijenge Tanzania.  He used the previous loan to increase his stock by buying a bale of better quality second hand clothes.  This enabled him to sell to many customers.  He appreciates Kiva for their support.

Maia gets a really small income that is obviously hardly enough even for food for three children. \r\n\r\nMaia has a great desire to make income from any source to tackle the financial difficulties. She decided to start dairy farming and seek credit among local financial institutions, but her attempts were unsuccessful because of her poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe startup program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. \r\n\r\nHer application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of GEL 1,100 for purchasing a milk cow.  After the cow is purchased the family will start producing dairy products: cheese and yogurt for selling.

Lay Eaing Kone has a population of approximately 500. The group has five CBO (Community Based Organization) members, overseeing a group of forty-two village customers. Rice farming is the main activity in this village. \n\nThis loan will help some group members purchase fertilizers, crop seeds, rent farming equipment and petrol. In this region, rice farming can only be done one season, the rainy season, per year. Therefore, families in this village also have additional income sources to ease family financial issues.  This includes either livestock such as pigs and ducks, or seasonal plantation such as calabash trees and betel trees.\n\nPictured above are CBO members from Lay Eaing Kone Village group, named (From left to right) Than, Myint, Kyaw and Thein. Than is part of a family that has farmed for generations. He and his family have to struggle just to live day-to-day life because their main income comes from farming one season per year.  This is less than other areas in the Myanmar Delta, where rainfall permits farming for two seasons per year. Than's family also faces risks such as over-flooding of his paddy field from excessive rain.\n\nThe loan from Proximity will help Than buy much needed fertilizers, pesticides and hire laborers.  Hired labor is important to increase yield from his paddy production. Than is proud to be a father of four children and supports his youngest son's education, who is in his final year at Yangon Institute of Technology.

Ayleene has spent years helping others through her work with various non-profits and community organizations, but lack of funding for Ayleene\u2019s department at her former job left her unemployed for nearly a year. This was a major setback in Ayleene\u2019s life that caused severe damage to her credit as she did not have the funds to care for family and to pay her bills. Ayleene has since found stable work with an organization that has been established for several years and is known for providing education and counselling for young women. She has since settled her financial obligations however, the damage to her credit has hindered her ability to access financing to make much needed repairs to her home. Ayleene needs to replace her air conditioner due to its inefficiency in cooling her home and the extremely high energy costs associated with running the old unit. Summer is fast approaching and she cannot afford to pay for her air conditioner out of pocket, so she turned to SELF in hopes that she will be able to access affordable financing that will also help her rebuild her credit. This repair will not only save Ayleene money, but will also help her rebuild her financial strength while providing enhanced livability in her home for herself and her child.\n\nAyleene will use her KIVA loan to pay for a new high efficiency air conditioner that will help her save money on energy bills, reduce her carbon footprint, rebuild her credit and improve the livability in her home for herself and her child. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":297.07,"image":{"id":1862283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"a new high efficiency air conditioner that will help her save money on energy bills, reduce her carbon footprint, rebuild her credit and improve the livability in her home for herself and her child.

As much as possible, they have to have all the needed fishing accessories to minimize chances of a low or zero catch.  She already has floaters to help guard her fish cages.  She also wants to buy the fish catch of her neighbors so she can sell more fish to the nearby fish market, where she will fetch higher prices.  In the future, she dreams of purchasing a new fishing boat by setting aside some savings from the daily sales.  She wishes to see her children have stable jobs as well.
