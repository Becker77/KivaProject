fruits and veggies to sell at her fruit store. Through her earnings she is able to send her children to school and meet their daily living expenses. \r\n\r\nShe would now like to apply for another 10,000 PHP loan which she will use as her working capital to buy more quantities of bananas, papaya, pineapple, coconut, squash and cabbage, among others which she sells at retail. More fruits and vegetables displayed on her stand will result in more sales and thus increase her earnings. Her income from her store is a stable source with which to sustain her family's basic needs and for the education of her children. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. \r\n\r\nArceli hopes to buy a vehicle in the future, to easily deliver her products to her customers who buy in large quantities. She aims to give her children the best education possible for them to have a better future. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1789173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more fruits and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-05-05T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-04T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3687.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017850},{"amount":50.01,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2212.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314265},{"amount":83.32,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3687.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522962},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.29,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:34:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1475.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433355}],"funded_date":"2015-05-05T13:06:48Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:34:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miranda A","image":984688}},{"id":879801,"name":"Lucila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucila is 47 years old and lives in Tangub, Philippines.

They chose this crop business because it is profitable; fresh fruits and vegetables are in high demand. The requested loan is very important for them, because they need to purchase pesticide for the grape orchard and fertilizer needed for the farm. \r\n As this is Arevik's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn't have access to credit products before because they have no credit history. Through this joint initiative almost 500 borrowers like Arevik get a chance to have their first loans and develop their businesses.\r\nAssuring responsible monthly payments of the loan, Arevik and her husband hope for lenders' support. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1870051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for pesticide for the grape orchard and fertilizer needed for the farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Aygehovit village, Tavush region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2015-05-05T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-04T01:50:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arevik","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":26.36},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":26.64},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":26.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.31},{"due_date":"2016-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.24},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27.44},{"due_date":"2016-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.03},{"due_date":"2016-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.15},{"due_date":"2016-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":28.46},{"due_date":"2016-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":28.84},{"due_date":"2016-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.15},{"due_date":"2017-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.42},{"due_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.74},{"due_date":"2017-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.14},{"due_date":"2017-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.46},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.36},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.64},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.38},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.31},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.24},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.44},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.03},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.15},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.46},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.84},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.15},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.42},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.74},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.14},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-21T13:19:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Richard Neuman","image":null}},{"id":876788,"name":"D\u00fao Shalom De San Bartolo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"D\u00fao Shalom de San Bartolo\nEste d\u00fao est\u00e1 formado por don Rub\u00e9n Alfonso, \u00e9l tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad y se dedica a la venta de consumo diario, como golosinas, yogurt, cereal, leche, queso, frijoles volteados, verduras en general, arroz, pastas, papel higi\u00e9nico, dulces, aguas gaseosas, el est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para surtir su tienda de consumo diario ubicado en la calle principal de San Bartolom\u00e9 Milpas Altas, su prop\u00f3sito es comprar abarrotes como arroz, frijol, aceite y aguas gaseosas,espera que le puedan ayudar con el credito solicitado.","en":"Shalom Duet from San Bartolo.\r\nThis duet is formed by Mr. Ruben Alfonso, who is 34 years old.

We encourage you to support her in achieving her goals, especially to improve her income through increased production and the coffee quality for this year."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1868201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy fertilizers necessary for her coffee plantation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":295,"posted_date":"2015-05-05T02:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-04T02:10:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-07T18:27:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kiyoko Ikeuchi","image":null}},{"id":878449,"name":"Zebogul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zebogul is a young woman, who is 28 years old.

Since he was a child he has worked as an assistant in several stores.  But once he learned how to manage the business he traveled to Barranquilla where families and friends helped him open his own business.\r\n\r\nJose has a very solid business and vast experience.  He opened his store ten years ago and has life-long experience.  He purchases store goods in cash to keep a high profit margin while offering his customers low prices.  He conducts 80% of sales in cash and 20% on credit.\r\n\r\nHe is currently applying for a CrediKiva loan, his first through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, to buy goods such as rice, oil, cane sugar, sugar, legums, dairy products and meats.  This is to optimize his inventory since daily consumer goods have a fast turn-around.  Jose believes this investment will improve his service rating as customers will find everthing in one place.  \r\n\r\nJose has two sons, ages 15 and 16, and a 7-year-old daughter.  He wants them to have a proper home, education and well-being.  His long-term goal is to grow his business and open another store."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":231.81,"image":{"id":1865421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"To buy goods such as rice, oil, cane sugar, sugar, legumes, dairy products and meat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-05-05T07:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-04T07:50:05Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Joaquin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1280000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":71533},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":93447},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96017},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":98657},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":101370},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":104158},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":107023},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":109966},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":112990},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":116097},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":119290},{"due_date":"2016-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":149452}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.9},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.34},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.93},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.67,"local_amount":164980,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:55:06Z","rounded_local_amount":166035.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681350496},{"amount":35.63,"local_amount":96017,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":96631.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.75,"payment_id":696560764},{"amount":36.09,"local_amount":98657,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":99287.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.37,"payment_id":711475503},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":101370,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:25:17Z","rounded_local_amount":102018.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.94,"payment_id":730994371},{"amount":37.49,"local_amount":104158,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":104824.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.23,"payment_id":752082331}],"funded_date":"2015-06-04T04:44:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":879958,"name":"Joan Marie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joan Marie  is 22 years old and single.

On 1.4 hectares of land she cultivates clover for sales. In order to further develop her farm, Chakali has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy two steers for fattening up and selling.

She is getting a degree in nutrition.  She is intelligent, responsible, persistent, sweet, caring, sensible, and very studious.  She studies at the public university in the center of the city, an area surrounded by buildings that hold commercial and public administration offices, restaurants, plazas, and all kinds of businesses.  The climate is cold and dry with a temperature that varies during the day between 3-14 degrees celsius.  \r\n\r\nRocio has a short stature and thin build with a dark complexion, brownish-grey eyes, and long black hair that she wears down.  Her maternal language is Aymar\u00e1, but she almost never speaks it because she is studying and living in the city.  She lives in her parents' home with her 2 younger sisters who are in school.  They have their own home equipped with potable water, electricity, and plumbing.  \r\n \r\nShe is in the process of getting a degree in nutrition, and she is in the 2nd year of the 5-year degree.  She is motivated by her social sensibility, as she is well suited to taking care of people.  By studying diet and nutrition science, she would like to solve nutritional health problems and to be able to rely on a steady profession through her studies while serving society.  She notes that she is thinking of doing consultations and research, and integrating multidisciplinary strategies to improve people's diet and nutritional situation.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of her degree is that the demand for professionals in her area is high, and the disadvantage is that she doesn't have the necessary funds to buy study materials.  Her dream is to finish studying, and to specialize in nutritional supplements for athletes.  She wants to buy a laptop computer to  continue her studies and finish her degree.  This is her first sequence of loans with this institution in the 2 years that she has been studying to become a professional.  \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Rocio is requesting a loan to buy a personal computer to continue her professional studies and specialize in sports nutrition.

He is a very strong, hard-working, ambitious, and determined person. He is married, and he has a teenage son. He is a resident of the sector of Bello, and he makes a living renting out washing machines. He started performing this work as a result of economic necessity. He was unemployed, and he saw a great opportunity to earn an income in the washing machine rental business because many families, like his, are humble and do not have this electrical appliance. For them, it is more economic to rent it.\r\n\r\nOne of the keys to his success is that Jorge learned how to perform maintenance on his machines, saving himself the expenses of paying a professional.

This is Irene. She is the Supervisor of Lorencia Junior School, a mixed school in the Rural area of Nsangi with 400 students. \r\n\r\nLorencia Junior School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nLorencia Junior School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.
