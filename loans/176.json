She has worked for many years in domestic services. Her earnings have helped support her children and husband, who works a professional musician. Her husband plays music at the Rotunda Bello Horizonte, but this does not pay well. As the times have changed, Sandra started a business selling cosmetics to increase her earnings.\r\n\r\nWith a previous loan, Sandra made improvements to her house. With this loan, she will add a room to give more privacy for her family. \r\n\r\nSandra has worked from a young age, as her parents were poor.

She knows she is responsible for making all of her payments on time, and she is ready to do so. Within her communal bank, she is always well-informed about the agreements made by her fellow members.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":891288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more groceries for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PS","country":"Palestine","town":"Rafah city, Gaza Strip","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.92157 35.203285","type":"point"}},"partner_id":80,"posted_date":"2011-10-15T15:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adnan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1186.41,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":64.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":131.82,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":133.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244646921},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":65.91,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":66.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257273748},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":65.91,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-22T08:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":66.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264623342},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":65.91,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":66.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270129818},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":65.91,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":66.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276746840},{"amount":800.03,"local_amount":790.95,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":800.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283318168}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T04:31:52Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:52:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Sharfman","image":562243}},{"id":348701,"name":"Evangeline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evangeline is married, 45 years of age, and lives in Poblacion Bonifacio Misamis Occidental together with her two kids.

Ainur is the leader of this group. She is forty-five years old and has three children. Her two sons are sixteen and fifteen and her daughter is eleven. For Ainur\u2019s family, living in a village does seem to be a burden, unlike many other villagers who leave villages because of an absence of opportunities for improving one\u2019s living standards.\r\n\r\nAinur\u2019s husband has been working as a physics teacher in a local school. As for Ainur, she has been engaged in cattle breeding and increasing the total population of their livestock. Their stable income from raising the livestock for resale, is $90 a month. Ainur\u2019s children have already learned the aspects of this activity and actively provide help when needed after school.\r\n\r\nAinur and her husband are good examples of the category of people who prefer to make the best use of the conditions and opportunities available instead of blaming others for not being able to live properly. Recently they made a decision to make some changes to their house as well. They decided to build a new house and a separate bathroom. This is not an easy task and they need quite a lot of financial support. Therefore Ainur strongly hopes to obtain this loan to start building.\r\n\r\nAinur\u2019s partners: \r\n\r\nR. Lira, 51, has three children. Her husband works as a security guard and he also farms land. Lira is a housewife. Besides that, she keeps some cattle at home and thus helps her husband have an extra source of family income. Lira needs a loan to buy fuel, seed potatoes and wheat seeds for the family farm.\r\n\r\nI. Baktygul, 53, has four children and her husband is a private farmer. Baktygul is a language schoolteacher; she teaches both Russian and Kyrgyz. They also own a piece of land and now need a loan to buy fuel for farming.\r\n\r\nZ. Aftandil, 24, is single. He wants to get married and buy a car but he knows that to achieve this, he needs to work hard and earn a sufficient amount of money. He has already started saving money. Now he farms land and needs a loan to buy fuel and seed potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She earns a minimum of 250 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<br>To help her continue to operate her business, Remedios is requesting a 14,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy more cured meats.

old. Her husband is a fisherman.  One source of their income comes from fishing.  Her husband works as a fisherman but this only gives them a small income.  Her husband works hard all day catching fish in the ocean, but he brings home a very small amount of money because the ones who own the fishing equipment get a larger amount, and they will only give him a small percent.\r\n\r\nSo Agnes decided to request loan again with Kiva field partner, Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) to buy fishing equipment so that the revenue will be only for them. She will used the loan to buy fishing cages (fish traps), fishing nets, and other things that are needed in her fishing business. She will help her husband sell the fish that he will catch in the sea. \r\n\r\nShe decided to set up this business in order to increase their daily income and sustain their needs, like everyday expenses and the education of her five children: Christine Joy - 17 years old, Crister - 14 years old, Jess - 9 years old, John - 7 years old, and Roman - 4 years old. \r\n\r\nAgnes is very happy to

He is 46 years old and married. To make a living, Guillermo owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting corn for sale. Guillermo has been engaged in his business for over 15 years and earns approximately 35000 PHP per harvest.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Guillermo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Guillermo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and crops to raise. Guillermo is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Guillermo from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Micheline a arr\u00eat\u00e9 l'\u00e9cole au cours secondaire. Pour subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins et \u00e0 ceux de ses enfants, Micheline m\u00e8ne comme activit\u00e9 la vente de tissus, d'ustensiles de cuisine et de bijoux de fa\u00e7on secondaire, depuis une trentaine d'ann\u00e9e. Micheline s'approvisionne dans l'un des march\u00e9s du B\u00e9nin. Cette activit\u00e9 lui g\u00e9n\u00e8re des revenus, l'aidant ainsi \u00e0 assurer les diverses charges de sa famille.

The members of the group live in the same district. Wishing to grow their working capital, this group is asking for a loan from ALID\u00e9 for the second time. \r\n\r\nMicheline was born on April 4, 1976 in B\u00e9nin. She is married to a teacher named Christophe. The couple has three children, all enrolled in school, and living together with their parents. \r\n\r\nMicheline stopped attending school at the secondary level. To support herself and her children, Micheline has been selling cloth, kitchen utensils and secondarily, jewelry for some thirty years. She buys her merchandise in a market in B\u00e9nin. This activity generates income that helps her cover the various family expenses. This second loan will certainly help Micheline and the other members of the group LA VOLONTE DE DIEU, to expand their businesses and grow their clientele and their revenue.

Luis is single and father of 4 children with ages ranging between 4 and 15 years old. They are all in school. Besides his children he also supports his mother and father -- both live with him. \r\n\r\nLuis went to school until the 5th grade and he says he did not continue due to financial hardship his family encountered and the civil war in Mozambique. The war caused the family to flee to the neighboring country Swaziland. Today Luis lives in his own home located at the 14th kilometer in Boane. \r\n\r\nLuis is a construction worker and a retailer since 2003 and, gradually, he has been taking over the family's business. He learned how to be a construction worker in Swaziland, and he learned how to be a retailer with friends by selling cookies and sheets around town. He has been doing this for 5 years. The best selling products are sugar, sold for 23,00 MT per kilo, and peanuts for 35,00 MT per kilo. Running his business is difficult because he gets the products in the city of Maputo once a week by public transportation. He generates 300,00 Mt daily and 2.100,00 Mt weekly which amounts to approximately 9.000,00 monthly. Luis has not been able to save any money because he invests largely into the business. The challenge to increase business volume and maintain it moving along is to have enough merchandise and good customer service. \r\n\r\nThis is Luis' second loan. The first one was in the amount of 15000,00 Mt and it was used to purchase basic need products which triggered business expansion. Luis has never requested loans from any other institution. He found out about Hluvuku through friends and made contact with it to request his first loan. This second loan will be used to purchase additional merchandise to beef up stock and, therefore, improve business performance. \r\n\r\nLuis' plans include fostering business growth and, in the future, he intends to request another loan to further expand this venture. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p>\r\n\r\nLuis tem 36 anos de idade e nasceu na prov\u00edncia de Maputo no distrito de Boane. Luis \u00e9  solteiro e pai de 4 filhos com idade variando entre 15 anos o mais velho e 4 anos o mais novo. Todos v\u00e3o a escola. Para alem dos seus filhos sustenta a sua m\u00e3e e seu pai que vivem com eles na mesma casa.\r\n\r\nLuis estudou apenas at\u00e9 5\u00aaClasse e diz que n\u00e3o continuou por dif\u00edcil situa\u00e7\u00e3o financeira da fam\u00edlia e devido a guerra civil de Mo\u00e7ambique, que fez a fam\u00edlia abandonar a zona para o pais vizinho Swazilandia. Hoje Luis vive na casa pr\u00f3pria no Km 14 em Boane.\r\n\r\nLuis \u00e9 pedreiro e comerciante permanente desde 2003 e vem assumindo na integra a quest\u00e3o de negocio da fam\u00edlia. Aprendeu na Swazilandia a ser pedreiro, e com os amigos a ser comerciante, vendendo biscoitos e mantas  na zona. Fazem 5 anos que se dedica ao negocio. Os produtos com destaque \u00e9 a\u00e7\u00facar que vende o kg por 23,00mt e amendoim por 35,00mt o kg. A sua atividade \u00e9 um pouco dif\u00edcil por que os produtos adquire na cidade de Maputo e vai dos transporte p\u00fablicos uma vez por semana. Tem rendimentos di\u00e1rios entre 300,00mt e 2.100,00mt semanais e aproximadamente 9.000,00mt mensal. Luis n\u00e3o consegue poupar algo por que a tend\u00eancia \u00e9 investir mais no negocio. O desafio para aumentar ou manter o seu negocio ser\u00e1 ter sempre mercadoria e um bom atendimento aos clientes.\r\n\r\nEste \u00e9 o segundo empr\u00e9stimo para Luis onde o primeiro foi de 15000,00mt que usou para compra de produtos da primeira necessidade ampliando assim o seu negocio. Luis nunca levantou empr\u00e9stimo noutras institui\u00e7\u00f5es. Conheceu a Hluvuku atrav\u00e9s dos amigos e assim contactou e solicitou o seu primeiro empr\u00e9stimo.

This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her.

They have just finished moving into their new home. Ever since he was a child, he has been involved in agriculture. He grows peas and potatoes for a living. His crops have always done well because he is constantly fertilizing them, which requires a lot of investment. Despite how arduous his work is, he is happy at the end of the day because it is the only thing he knows how to do and his sole source of income. Amalio stresses that in order to harvest good crops for the demanding market, it takes a lot of sacrifice and it generally depends on the weather. He grows crops on seasonal farms, so he is subject to climate factors. For this reason, his goal is to obtain irrigated lands in which he does not have to invest too much to grow his crops. Amalio has been a very responsible client during the 9 consecutive months that he has been working with MFP. Furthermore, whenever he has time, he helps out the executive board for the progress and development of his microfinance institute. The money he is requesting will be used to purchase chemical fertilizers because without them, he has no way of ensuring a good harvest. He will have enough money to purchase pea seeds and 10 sacks of fertilizer. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":313029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-12T07:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amalio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1027.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733827},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1027.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959544}],"funded_date":"2009-05-14T02:54:27Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":110195,"name":"Tavakkal","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\t\u041c\u0443\u043c\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0422\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043a\u043a\u0430\u043b \u0420\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0431\u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 1974 \u0433\u043e\u0434 \u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f ,\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 3 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439 .\u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0425\u0443\u0441\u043d\u0438\u044f .\u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0433. \u0418\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0430\u043d \u043a. \u0421\u0443\u0444\u0438-\u041e\u0440\u0438\u0444 .\u041a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0451\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0435\u043c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 ,\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f  \u044d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e 10 \u043b\u0435\u0442 .\u041a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u043d ,\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 .\u041a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0451\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0435\u043c 1200 \u0441\u043e\u043c. \u043d\u0430 10\u043c\u0435\u0441. \u0414\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439   \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438.","en":"Tavakkal M. was born in 1974 and is married with 3 children.

He does this with his wife\u2019s valuable help.\r\n\r\nAlso, six months ago he started driving a taxi from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.  They pay him 20 PEN a day.  On the week ends he works until 11 at night plowing in order to get greater income to support his family.\r\n\r\nDuring the coffee harvesting months he leaves aside his work as a driver and works on gathering his harvest to avoid loosing the coffee beans, which are so valuable for his family.\r\n\r\nJuan feels very pleased with his farming, and while he is driving in his car he thinks about his crops.  One time he was robbed because he was not there.  Because of that his wife tries to go to the fields constantly to take care that they bear fruit.  When the crop is sold, he gets very good earnings.  His goal is to increase his coffee crop.\r\n\r\nThis is his fifth consecutive loan working with MFP.  He makes all of his payments on time.

Four of the women are married, and one is a single mother.  All of the members work in commerce, the predominant economic activity in this region.  Each one of them sells different products as street vendors in the same community or in the outskirts of Collantes.\r\n\r\nMaria Teresa Martiniez sells fresh pork.  Maribel Dom\u00ednguez M. sells clothes and perfume.  Emiliana Velasco D. sells sweets inside of an elementary school.  Her husband grows papaya.  When they collect the harvest she helps to sell papaya, which is approximately every six months.  Cira Lidia D. S. buys and sells fresh fish.  Ana Maria Dom\u00ednguez S. sells fresh, butchered chicken.\r\n\r\nOn the average, they have spent 15 years doing these activities.  They decided to work to economically help their husbands.  Their salaries for sometimes working in the fields do not cover the family\u2019s necessary expenses.  This is especially true when they have another person to take care of like a grandchild or other relative to support such as in the case of Cira Lidia D. S., who is raising her granddaughter.\r\n\r\nMaribel D. M., the group\u2019s representative, found out about the micro loans with few requirements that Fundacion Realidad gives.  She got together with the other members.  They met the requirements and asked for a loan to help them buy the products that they sell like fresh pork, clothes and perfume, sweets, fresh fish, and fresh butchered chicken.  The loan will also help with the expenses generated when they have to makes their purchases and travel to the city of Pinotepa Nacional or El Puerto de Acapulco, Guerrero.\r\n\r\nThese clients say that they feel satisfied with the support from the loan given by the Fundacion Realidad.  When they started their businesses a while ago, they did not have access to a loan because they did not meet the requirements of the banks.  They hope that the institution does not stop offering this type of service.  They hope that, cycle to cycle, its investment will be larger each time.  Then the well being of their families, above all, the well being of the children, will be better each time.  If possible, some day each one will have an established place to sell their products.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":382726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy and sell products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SANTIAGO PINOTEPA NACIONAL","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2009-09-04T16:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cira Lidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":6500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":481.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":481.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":481.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":481.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T18:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":6513.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87040237},{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6513.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96952636},{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6513.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794794},{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6513.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110685954}],"funded_date":"2009-09-10T23:38:28Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":138920,"name":"Lydia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lydia P. is from the city of Dapitan.

She is 45 years old. Carolina is married and has six school-aged children. Carolina owns and operates a piggery. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Carolina has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it. \r\n\r\nIn 2011, Carolina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. Carolina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Carolina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisher-folk and small entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is very responsible with her income and savings and keeps a record of her expenses, sales, and inventory in a notebook she carries everywhere with her.  With her past loans, she has managed to use her savings to buy a freezer. She says her ability to purchase this freezer has been the key to her success.  She is now able to sell perishable items, cold water, and cold beer to her neighbors\u2014and as a result has greatly increased her sales.\r\n<p>\r\nMartire says it has been a hard life; she supports her three children, her mother who is very ill, and her husband by herself.

The loan that Haitali is requesting is the exact amount of money he needs to buy a car. The region that he lives in lacks a permanent mode of transportation that would link it to the center of the region or the center of the city.

For 11 years she has dedicated herself to the baking and selling of bread.  At 4:00am she begins kneading the dough in the bakery and at 6:00am she situates herself in the park of her village with the basket of breads which she sells until 8:00am.  She then returns home until 2:00pm to prepare food for and attend to her children, and begins anew to knead dough for the lunch hour (afternoon meal).  She again situates herself in the park of her village until 7:00pm.  \r\n<p>\r\nDespite being very tired from her work, Martha says she is very content because she enjoys selling and being in contact with the people.  Every day she starts with a capital of 20 to 30 PEN with which she earns 50 or 60 PEN.  She tells us of her joy for her business despite her difficulties in health due to constantly rising before dawn and working in the intense cold.  One of her future goals is to buy a house where she could put a small store for selling various products and to leave the park and the cold, thereby capturing better income for her household and for the well-being of her children.  This is her first loan with MFP which she commits to pay on time according to the payment plan established by the loan officer of her communal bank.  The money that Martha asks for is to buy sacks of flour for baking her breads.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by William Gray, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":284244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-19T00:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":133.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117231},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":133.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012142},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:41Z","rounded_local_amount":133.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595727},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":133.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989989},{"amount":40.59,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":133.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211120},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":133.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640623},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":133.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080153},{"amount":40.66,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:21Z","rounded_local_amount":133.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996446}],"funded_date":"2009-03-19T01:27:40Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"William Gray","image":132141}},{"id":97923,"name":"Makunguru B Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Getruda has been a clothes and snacks seller in the Mwanjelwa neighborhood of Mbeya for 6 years.

P. is 36 and married with five children (ages 1 - 14).  She owns a business planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Fuatino has three years of experience in this business.  Fuatino needs a loan of WST $1,700 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fuatino joined SPBD.  This is her third loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fuatino's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

She is separated and lives in her own house with her 3 grown and independent children.  For many years, Elena had a grocery store selling perishable items, but she had to close it because she could not make back what she invested in it.  Because of that, she now sells electrical appliances, clothing, sheets, pillowcases, and pillows.  She sews the garments herself at home.  She buys the appliances wholesale at the Lima shopping center and then sells them to her customers at their homes.  Both businesses are going very well, since she earns almost double on every item she sells, and that's why she wants to increase her production of bedspreads and sheets.  Now, with this business, Elena says she feels \"more relaxed and less hectic\".  In the future she would like to buy fabric wholesale, buy a variety of merchandise, and finish building her house, in order to live on rental income and on the money from her business.  Elena belongs to a small community group, and this is the first individual loan apart from her group that she has with MFP, since she demonstrated responsibility with her payments.  She promises to be responsible again.  Each month she buys the merchandise she needs for her business, so she will use the loan she is asking for to buy various fabrics and appliances to increase her

She earns her living by buying and selling fruits & vegetables.  Her husband Conrado, who is 59 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are 12 to 37 years old. Carmelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Carmelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she added to her working capital, helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy more fruits and vegetables to resell so that she can continue to save up for the higher education of her children and expansion of her business. Carmelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The official name of this borrowing group is Helen S.'s Group.\r\n\r\nHelen is married and has 8 school-aged children. She owns and operates a farming business, planting and harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale. Helen has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Helen joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Helen is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Helen from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She and her children are living in the rural village of Pilitan in Tuamuini, Isabela where farming is the main source of income by the people and their main products are corn and tobacco.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer husband Carlos is an Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) and she was left temporarily with their four children: Boyet, 23, a high school graduate; Arlene, 21, is already married and a graduate of computer technology classes. Two of their children are still studying, one in college and one is taking vocational courses. Ofelia said that they have a relatively good family situation and they are facing every challenge without complaints, as God is always there for her.\r\n <p>\r\nThrough the remittance of her husband, Ofelia was able to start hog raising business. This is her way of helping her husband in providing the educational needs of their children and household needs. Ofelia and her children dislike being away from her husband and this is her reason for having a small business--to keep her busy and at the same time assist in their financial needs. She is now requesting for a loan of $75 (PHP 3,000.00) to purchase feed for her hogs.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Tina needs a loan of WST $750 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tina joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

The official name of this borrowing group is Hilaria R..\r\n\r\nHilaria is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, she prepares and sells cooked food for daily meals. She has been engaged in her business for over thirty years and earns approximately $92 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Hilaria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 1st loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The official name of this borrowing group is Elvira A.'s Group.\r\n<br>Elvira is 49 years old, married and has eight school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a food stall. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from tending a canteen near the school. Elvira has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2006, Elvira joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elvira is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be her tenth from ASKI.

She lives in Barranquilla, where she has had a hairdresser and beauty salon since 2000, when she graduated from a beauty academy.  She initially did haircuts, manicures, pedicures, and styling for her friends from home.  Over time, people began to seek her out, and, through word of mouth, she built up a full-time business. She loves her line of work, especially the make-up, which is her strong point.  Both her children, now working professionals, and her husband always help her with expenses, as they are a close family. This is her first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She will use it to buy a mirror, a barber's chair and a hair-washing basin.  This will make her clients more comfortable.

They live together in the small town of Canayre, where they have a rented house.\r\n\r\nRolando says that when he was a child he always wanted to excel economically, and this is why he has been working as a traveling salesman since he was 17 years old. When he finished school, he worked at a sewage project, which is where he made the capital that he used to buy merchandise and begin traveling among the markets, which are his points of sale. This is how Rolando sells his products, and he is proud of his good earnings. In the near future he wants to establish himself in the town, where he can have his own house and open a store in it. Then he would not be traveling from market to market since that has many disadvantages, and sometimes the products deteriorate because of the long trip Rolando makes.\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan, so he is committed to making his payments on time. With the 1,500 new soles, Rolando will buy more varied products, including items for the home, so he can stock his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":915435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy household products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-13T00:20:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rolando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":123.57},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":133.24},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":136.43},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":141.37},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":148.78},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":151.87},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":158.15},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":162.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":169.78},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":174.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.07},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.19},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":101.68,"local_amount":265.25,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":275.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836091},{"amount":49.6,"local_amount":129.38,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":134.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245851},{"amount":110.96,"local_amount":289.47,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":300.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098971},{"amount":57.94,"local_amount":151.16,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-22T08:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":156.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713105},{"amount":60.63,"local_amount":158.15,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":164.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202072},{"amount":62.29,"local_amount":162.49,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":168.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097890},{"amount":131.9,"local_amount":344.1,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:34Z","rounded_local_amount":357.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400727}],"funded_date":"2011-12-22T19:37:48Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":361064,"name":"Demetria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Demetria es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cCandelaria\u201d del centro poblado Poccona, distrito y provincia D.

This is thirty-year-old Salima from Dar es Salaam. She is married with four children under the age of fifteen. She is also financially responsible for another child who is a relative. Salima owns and runs a stall from which she sells essential grocery items. The Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is genge. <P>A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. <P>Additionally, Salima has capitalized on Dar es Salaam\u2019s proximity to the Indian Ocean and the fondness of its residents for fish to sell roasted fish at her genge. This helps her earn some extra income. She currently makes US$ 90 per month from sales at her genge. <P>Salima is requesting a loan of US$ 225 to purchase additional fish, cooking oil, and cooking fuel for her stall. She is hopeful that selling more fish will help her earn higher profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. <P>The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":191864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase supplies in bulk for her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T00:30:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T01:56:05Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":23,"local_amount":25555.56,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":26749,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356199},{"amount":22,"local_amount":24444.44,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":25586,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347941},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970515},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886732},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435992},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130290},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:09Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027121},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613161},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:57Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010244},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232555}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T01:56:05Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65174,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth G. operates a grocery store in her neighborhood.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged its already weak economy. 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable--conditions that have resulted in high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Cecilia is a single mother and the little help she gets comes from her two oldest sons who work and study.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":431875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy sand and cement to finish building her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-21T00:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia Argentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.96,"local_amount":839.14,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":869.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003242},{"amount":42.8,"local_amount":856,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:11Z","rounded_local_amount":886.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841399},{"amount":86.76,"local_amount":1735.16,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1797.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874314},{"amount":90.01,"local_amount":1800.28,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1865.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639672},{"amount":46.73,"local_amount":934.65,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":968.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821448},{"amount":91.74,"local_amount":1834.77,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1901.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561460}],"funded_date":"2009-11-22T20:03:48Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":159627,"name":"Jeanny Marivil","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia JEANNY MARIVIL hace un a\u00f1o que pertenece al banco comunal \u201cPROSPERIDAD\u201d  \n\nNuestra socia es una joven madre de familia, tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada, tienen dos hijos y esta embarazada.

R., 31, lives with her husband and their four children in a community called Ca\u00f1o Negro.  It is located in Los Chiles in the Alajuela province.  This area is in a mountainous region near the northern border of the country. The main economic activities are livestock breeding and agriculture, specifically the planting and harvesting of basic grains, sugar cane, and oranges.\n\nKarla has worked in a hotel for a little over two months.  She says that she now has a source of income, which helps her husband with the household expenses.  But, she says, her work is pretty far from her house.  It is difficult for her to get there because there is very little public transportation and her schedule rotates.  Sometimes she needs to wait a long time to find transportation. \n\nTherefore, Karla has decided to buy a motorcycle to be better able to get places.  That way she will speed up the way she travels, and she will be able to save and take advantage of having more time.  To do this she needs a loan for \u00a2654,000 (six hundred fifty four thousand colones) to buy the motorcycle.  That way she will be able to have her own vehicle, which will allow her to get ahead and facilitate her form of travel.\n\nKarla is part of the Emcrecoba Communal Finance Institution, one the 100 organizations that are members of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be her second loan, and with the loan she hopes to continue growing on a personal and economic level.  She also plans on actively participating in the loan organization in her community.\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She will use the requested loan to buy some products for her business so she can always fulfill her customers' requests.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":506645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy vegetables, oil, flour, soft drinks, beer, baked goods, meats, fruits, charcoal, cloth, thread, yeast","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Luque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.266667 -57.566667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T19:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eustacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Obtaciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ciriaca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clotilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zulma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cinthia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":12680935,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1056740}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1375,"local_amount":6340470,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6365111.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128951406},{"amount":916.67,"local_amount":4226980,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4243407.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136680096},{"amount":458.33,"local_amount":2113485,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:20:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2121698.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144714495}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T05:56:41Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:20:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":188941,"name":"Johana Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Johana tiene 22 a\u00f1os, y vive en casa de su suegra hace 3 a\u00f1os aproximadamente ya que \nconviv\u00eda con el padre de su menor hija; actualmente se encuentra separada de \u00e9l sin \nembargo a pesar de ello recibe el apoyo de sus suegros en cuanto a vivienda y \nalimentaci\u00f3n.

She is 23 years old and single. To make a living, Mildred owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Mildred has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP when she sells one of the animals she has raised.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mildred joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. This loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.
