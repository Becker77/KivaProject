kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":875711,"name":"Aflore","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aflore.co\/\">Aflore<\/a>  is a social enterprise in Colombia, founded by Ana (pictured) that provides underbanked people with access to credit and financial skills (Check out their video <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AHCjvT4tSMc&feature=youtu.be\">here<\/a> ).\n\nAflore\u2019s model builds on informal savings clubs that thrive in many Latin American countries, where money is borrowed and lent between family and friends. With Aflore\u2019s model, the financially savvy members of the community become Aflore\u2019s financial advisors. Afloreg empowers them with the training, tools and resources they need to help others around them. The result is positive change not only for the borrowers, but also for the financial advisors who act as leaders and role models within their own communities. This loan will be used to support Aflore\u2019s informal financial advisors by providing access to credit to their close networks. \n\nOne such advisor is Yaneth. She\u2019s seen as a financial role model by her peers because she\u2019s done well personally despite coming from a place without much opportunity. Members of the community frequently go to her for advice on personal finances. As a member of Aflore\u2019s team of informal advisors, she is able to help the people in her social network understand their financial situation and, where possible, support their loan application and refer them to Aflore for a credit assessment. If Aflore approves the loan, Yaneth earns commissions as her referrals make repayments. She also participates in Aflore\u2019s growth program, where she receives financial and personal development training. After one year with Aflore, Yaneth has helped 14 people to access loans. \n\nHer first referral was Shirley, one of her closest friends, who had never been able to get a loan through a bank since she only earns the minimum wage. Through Aflore, Yaneth provided her with a small loan to visit her sick mother and buy medicine. Once she repaid the loan, Shirley has continued building her credit history: she got a loan for making a home improvement and when she finished paying it, she decided to get an additional loan, together with her husband, and invest the money in growing his bike repair business. \n\nBecause of the positive experience Yaneth had with Shirley\u2019s loans, she continued to introduce other people in her trust network to Aflore. She has given loans to her brother and his partner to repair their taxi, to her friend Flor Maria to repay a loan shark, her neighbour Ricardo to stock his mini-market, to her mom who made home improvements, and to her daughter America who was able to pay her university tuition, amongst others. Yaneth\u2019s story has the potential to be replicated in the network of over 250 Informal Advisors currently working with Aflore who have already provided around 350 loans.\n\n65% of Latin America\u2019s 430 million adults live without a bank account. Even when they have access to a bank, many people simply do not trust the system. In Colombia, people flock to withdraw their earnings on payday, before the bank \u201closes\u201d their money. Traditional banks have earned a bad reputation, so people choose not to engage with them, despite the consequences of not establishing a credit history. For this reason, <a href=\"http:\/\/colombiareports.co\/30-4-colombians-age-15-bank-account\/\">only 2 out of 10 people<\/a> in Colombia have the ability to respond to a medical emergency or other unexpected expenses. Because of its work in this context, with just over a year in the market, Aflore has been widely recognised as a major innovation in financial inclusion by key leaders in the sector, including SOCAP (2014 guest entrepreneur) iNNpulsa (Colombia\u00b4s 50 most innovative startups), and BID Network (2014 Women in Business Finalist). \n\nYour contribution will help Aflore scale its impact in Colombia.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":20000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3193.98,"image":{"id":1866504,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Green"],"use":"to

That\u2019s why she decided to join Ruma. \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Warsini needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits to her community, so her community can stay connected with their loved ones, no matter how far they are apart. \r\n\r\nWarsini\u2019s goal towards Ruma in the near future is to serve as an e-commerce business for her community, with Ruma\u2019s latest product called Mapan. As seen in the photo, Warsini is the one who is standing in her own stall. She is thankful for your kind support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1871756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase additional prepaid airtime credit to sell to community members who want to use mobile phones to connect with loved ones.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bandung Timur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-05-05T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-04T21:00:03Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Warsini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":12000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":12000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":875635,"name":"Maria Olga","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Olga tiene 58  a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera y tiene un hijo de 15 a\u00f1os de edad que se encuntra estudiando, Olga comenta que sola a sabido sacar adelante a su hijo.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 1,000 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan, which she will use to buy grocery items and gallons of mineral water to sell. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are her source to meet their daily expense and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nEden hopes to maintain and grow her business so she they could have a better life and send all her children to college.

Sari-sari means \"variety\". They provide people with products mostly needed for everyday survival -- from products for personal hygiene such as shampoo, toothpaste, and powder, to condiments, food, canned goods, and other stuff at low prices. This is why many of those who want to go into business often start with being Sari-sari vendors because with just a bit of capital, one can automatically operate a store and earn income. \r\n\r\nIt's just like Lorna, 41 years old from Caloocan City, Metro Manila. She began getting involved with this kind of business years ago. What she does is basically buy stuff in a large quantity, display them at her store, and sell them in retail, often at prices that are very affordable for people but higher than the original cost so that she can take a profit. \r\n\r\nHowever, you cannot expect a regular and stable income from this since sales vary from time to time. For this reason, Lorna wants to ask you for a PHP 10,000 loan that she can buy more supplies of products to display in her store. Certainly, this will really help her improve her business and attract more customers. \r\n\r\nShe meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories from her life and business every week -- this is also where she can draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1872286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more supplies of products to display in her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-05-05T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-04T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":4666.69,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:55:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4686.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017860},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2678.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314275},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2678.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522972}],"funded_date":"2015-05-05T23:29:43Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:00:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Yan","image":1083582}},{"id":879273,"name":"Asep","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asep lives in Cianjur, located about three hour\u2019s drive from Jakarta.

Now she is leading a group of three members to take this loan with her portion used to pay a plowing fee to do farming. She hopes her crops will grow well and she can gain more yields than last year.

But of course, before reaching the top, you still need to go under. \r\n\r\nFlorinda is in a direct selling business now. She sells diverse products from popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Natasha, Boardwalk and others. In addition, she also sells snacks and food for another source of income. She gets enough profit from these, and the income from both trades is what she uses in sustaining her family's costs of living, with the support of her husband, Jerry. \r\n\r\nTo further improve sales, she would like to have a loan of PHP 11,000. If she will have enough funds to acquire more supplies of personal product sales, it would be better for higher income at hand. She hopes that your kind hearts will lend her this loan assistance. Thank you beforehand for your generosity and goodness.\r\n\r\nFlorinda meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Her home is far from the power grid. \r\n\r\nAs a farmer, Mob wants to expand her farming with five hectares of land and allow her family to live in comfortable conditions. However, her house is in a remote area and her current home energy is not reliable. Moreover, she needs to charge her battery three or four times every week for daily usage. The car battery she has is a time and money consuming energy source.

She has made herself independent and is earning sufficient income. \r\n\r\nShahida has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, to purchase stocks of threads, silk, fancy, sequins, and pearls of various colors. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan will prove beneficial for her and for her family. Shahida is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":341.94,"image":{"id":1872417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded

Hace tiempo, Gustavo trabajaba en un banco en su municipio, sus jornadas laborales eran de domingo a domingo y la mayor\u00eda de los d\u00edas sal\u00eda hasta la media noche para regresar a casa. \"Despu\u00e9s de vivir eso, mi meta fue ser mi propio jefe\".\n\nDespu\u00e9s de notar que en las escuelas de su comunidad vend\u00edan dulces y frituras, nada saludables para los ni\u00f1os, Gustavo decidi\u00f3 crear una propuesta y presentarla al Director de una de las instituciones. Pronto Gustavo se vio atendiendo a m\u00e1s de 350 ni\u00f1os en tan solo 20 minutos \"la hora del terror\" como le llama \u00e9l, pues debe atender con velocidad a todos los peque\u00f1os quienes ahora pueden comer tortas y tacos mejor preparados, frutas y verduras con \"chamoy\", entre otras opciones m\u00e1s saludables y atractivas. Gustavo comparti\u00f3 con alegr\u00eda que un d\u00eda un ni\u00f1o le dijo muy seriamente \"Preparas cosas muy sanas\", pero afortunadamente los ni\u00f1os las compran. \n\nEs as\u00ed que todos los d\u00edas Gustavo se levanta a las 3 o 4 am para comenzar a preparar toda la comida, llega a las 10 am a la escuela para comenzar a acomodar y recibir la estampida de ni\u00f1os una vez m\u00e1s. Finalmente, sus actividades en la escuela terminan a las 2 pm y est\u00e1 listo para comprar los ingredientes para el siguiente d\u00eda e ir a casa con su peque\u00f1a. En esta ocasi\u00f3n Gustavo necesita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar aceite, az\u00facar, j\u00edcama, zanahorias y pan.\n\n*La fotografia fue tomada la calle justo afuera de la casa de la tia de Gustavo, \u00e9l es quien tiene la playera negra y el pantal\u00f3n caf\u00e9*","en":"The members of the Esfuerzo (Effort) group live in a small community of the State of Mexico. Even though it is a very remote place and does not have all services specially transportation, its inhabitants keep on working hard day by day to carry out their activities. Another unique feature of the people from this town is that most of them, unlike the neighboring communities, are of lighter skin color and have a distinct accent. Among them are Gustavo and Arturo, who work providing services in school stores; Yolanda, who has a grocery store, and Karina who sells shoes and potatoes. Gustavo is an enterprising young man, father of a young daughter who is 1 year old, and for whom he works to give her more opportunities. Some time ago, Gustavo used to work at a bank in his municipality. His workdays were from Sunday to Sunday, and most of the days he would leave at midnight to go back home. \"After living that, my goal was to be my own boss\". After noticing that at the schools of his community they sold sweets and fried foods, not healthy for children, Gustavo decided to create a proposal to present to the Director of one of the institutions. Soon, Gustavo was serving more than 350 children in only 20 minutes at the \"terror time\" as he calls it, because he must service very quickly all the small children, who now can eat better prepared sandwiches and tacos, fruits and vegetables with \"chamoy\"(condiment), among other healthier and more attractive options. Gustavo shared with happiness what a child told him very seriously: \"You prepare very healthy things\", but fortunately the children buy them. This is why Gustavo gets up at 3 or 4 a.m. to start to prepare all the food. He arrives at school at 10 a.m. to start setting up and receive the stampede of children once more. Finally, his school activities finish at 2 p.m. and he is ready to buy the ingredients for the following day and go home to his small daughter. This time, Gustavo needs a loan to buy oil, sugar, jicama, carrots and bread.\r\n*The photograph was taken on the street outside Gustavo's aunt.

Her business is the sale of soft drinks. She is a good mother, enterprising, respectful, patient, responsible, and very hardworking. She develops her business in the \"Plan 3000\" area that is characterized by the origins of its inhabitants: Aymaras, Quechuas, and Guaran\u00ed, where they settled and formed a great commerce; it is of a warm, tropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 21-35 degrees centigrade. \r\n\r\nRuthi is dark-skinned, brown-eyed, with short, black hair, and of small stature and medium body shape. Her mother tongue is Spanish and she speaks Quechua because of her family's heritage (she is in front, dressed in a tank top with yellow and orange horizontal lines). She makes her life with her partner, who is in construction, and her two younger sons; the oldest is already independent. They live in a rented home, built of brick, with potable water, electricity, and sewage.\r\n\r\nHer will to improve brought her to form a communal bank of people with businesses such as video store, sandwiches sale, plaster artworks, soft drinks sale, library, cosmetics sale, welding workshop, and china, fruit, and breakfast sales so that they could request loans and improve their occupations. Her business is the sale of soft drinks, an occupation she does in a fixed sale stall Monday thru Saturday during the day. Due to the climate of the place, the drinks are in great demand. She buys ice daily to refrigerate her soft drinks in a cooler at her customers' full view. \"The ice melts fast and the customers demand the drink to be cold.

Her business's advantage is that, because of the warm climate of the place, sale is continuous all day; the disadvantage is the ice expenses that she must pay to be able to sell. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to open a soft drink distribution agency to sell at wholesale and retail. She wishes to expand her business by the purchase of a freezer where she could store her products so that they remain cold for the customer's satisfaction.

Y al igual que su padre, don Quiri ha podido dar educaci\u00f3n a sus hijos y estabilidad a la familia entera, su ilusi\u00f3n es que alguno de sus hijos contin\u00fae con el legado familiar.\n\n   Con el paso del tiempo, Quiri ha podido invertir en herramientas para su taller, siempre con el objetivo de brindar la mejor calidad y el mejor precio a sus clientes. El pr\u00e9stamo que solicita es de suma importancia ya que pretende comprar madera antes de que suba el precio puesto que la temporada que se acerca, con los cambios de clima logran que el material se eche a perder y debido a la escasez, el precio aumenta mucho m\u00e1s.\n \n   El grupo entero agradece por el apoyo brindado y por la oportunidad de los pr\u00e9stamos que son una fuente de motivaci\u00f3n importante en sus vidas. \n\n  *En la fotograf\u00eda Don Quirino viste camisa y se ubica detr\u00e1s de Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda quien viste blusa color rosa.\n","en":"Rivera del Rio is a group of nine people from a community in the state of Oaxaca, where the characteristics of the mazatecan culture, like language and festivities, are still preserved. The members are: Nicolasa and Rebeca who sell food; Jovita, textiles; Maria, women's clothing and bed sheets, Israel, soft drinks; Celia, candy, snacks and soft drinks. And on the other hand, Quirino, who runs a carpentry; Mauro, a vulcanizing and blacksmith's workshop; and Pablo a tailor's shop.\r\n\r\nQuirino is married to Carmela and father of four children. He is a carpenter. What has led Quiri, so his nickname, to dedicate the last 27 years of his life to his trade is his father's example: \"It is a family legacy. My father was a carpenter and with his income he used to make a living.\" And just like his father, Quiri was able to provide his children with education and stability for the whole family. His hope is that some of his children will continue the family legacy.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time, Quiri was able to invest in tools for his workshop, always with the goal of offering the best quality and the best price for his customers. The loan he is requesting is paramount, because he intends to buy wood before the prices will rise. Given that a time is coming, where climate changes will cause the material to get scarce, and due to the shortage the prices will rise significantly.\r\n\r\nThe whole group thanks for the support and the opportunity of these loans, because they are an important source of motivation in their lives. \r\n\r\n(In the photo, Quirino is wearing a shirt and stands behind Maria, who wears a pink

His business is done as a vendor at fairs and festivals in the city. The city is characterized by being built on Tiwanakota, Colla and Inca settlements, with a variable climate between -5 and 18 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nEddy has dark skin, gray hair that he keeps cut short, dark eyes, wears glasses, is short, has a robust physique, his native language is Aymar\u00e1, which he speaks with his family, and he speaks Spanish due to the general culture and the business he does. He shares his life with his family members who work, and live in their own house built of brick and cement which has drinking water, electricity, gas service, and sewer service. His business is selling chorip\u00e1n, which is a dish that is made up of barbequed chorizo, served in the middle of bread, which is a typical cuisine of the area. He generally prepares it with \"marraqueta\" bread and barbequed chorizo. The chorizo is of the barbequed type, typical of the high plains which is eaten fresh and is flavored with hot peppers. \"I began my business selling from the door of my house, later I moved to the fairs and festivals to improve my income...\" he says. The advantage of his business is the ease of preparation and the popularity of the dish. The disadvantage is the lack for furniture to improve the business. His dream is to open a business selling chorip\u00e1n from a vehicle. He wants to expand his business through the purchase of awnings, chairs and benches for the chorip\u00e1n sales. This is his first loan sequence in the 5 years he has been doing this work. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Eddy asks for a loan to purchase awnings, chairs and benches to sell chorip\u00e1n at fairs and festivals. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":534.82,"image":{"id":1869196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase awnings, chairs and benches to sell chorip\u00e1n [a chorizo sandwich] at fairs and festivals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-05-06T11:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-05T11:40:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":467.13},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":571.98},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":596.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":616.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":643.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":669.26},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":705.7},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":728.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.07},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.39},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.86},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":155.87,"local_amount":1039.11,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1067.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344495},{"amount":89.44,"local_amount":596.29,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:09Z","rounded_local_amount":612.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554707},{"amount":92.59,"local_amount":617.26,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":634.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468795},{"amount":96.53,"local_amount":643.57,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":661.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296633},{"amount":100.39,"local_amount":669.26,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:01Z","rounded_local_amount":687.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076827}],"funded_date":"2015-06-05T11:25:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Wendy Harris","image":null}},{"id":877531,"name":"Ren\u00e9 Noe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ren\u00e9 tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 hasta 5\u00b0 grado, ahora est\u00e1 casado y es padre de 4 hijos, dos varones los cuales viven aparte y son independientes y dos hembras que a\u00fan viven con ellos y estudian en l escuela y que por lo tanto dependen de \u00e9l. \n\nRene trabaja como fontanero en el proyecto de agua potable que est\u00e1 en su comunidad, desde hace 10 a\u00f1os se dedica a este oficio, tambi\u00e9n trabaja en agricultura en una parcela que est\u00e1 a unos minutos de su casa, mientras que su esposa le ayuda con los oficios del hogar.\n\nRene invertir\u00e1 el dinero para comprar fertilizantes para sus cultivos y pagar\u00e1 mano de obra.\n\n\u00c9l desea obtener un cr\u00e9dito m\u00e1s grande y as\u00ed poder mejorar su vivienda y brindarle a su familia todo lo necesario.\n","en":"Ren\u00e9 is 48 years old, went to school up to the 5th grade, now is married, and is the father of 4 children, two boys who now live on their own and are independent and two girls who still live with them and go to school and, so, depend on him. \r\n\r\nRen\u00e9 works as a plumber in the drinking water project that is in his community.

And just like any other mother, Grydia also dreams. Wanting to see her children graduate from college someday and expand her business, she is doing now her very best to excel at her craft. \r\n\r\nGrydia is 44 years old. She is married to Manolito, a foreman, and they have three kids. Currently, Grydia is busy operating her direct-selling business. She is selling different kinds of products, mostly, personal product sales like soaps, dish-washing liquids, detergents and the like. The profit she gets from the business becomes a great help for their family basically in terms of their daily expenses. \r\n\r\nTo further improve the business, she wants to ask for a 13 000 PHP loan which she will use for buying more products to sell. With this, she can surely gain more income and part of what she will gain, she will save for future investments and part will be used for their everyday living.  \r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll be a great blessing in advance. Thanks for your heartfelt generosity and goodness.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
