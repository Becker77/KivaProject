After graduation from college he went to study ecology at the University of Economic Policy Studies (USPEE) located in Chisinau the capital of Moldova. Though not having enough money after the first year to continue his studies full-time he had to reduce the amount of classes and start working to continue to be able to pay for University. He is now currently in his fourth year and still continues to work and go to school part time. For the last three years he has been living with his parents in the village he grew up in and works for a local agricultural company. While working for the agricultural company cultivating apple orchards, he took the knowledge and experience he learned and applied it to start his own business. For the first year of his business he rented an orchard with 2.3 hectares and worked out a deal to use the machinery from where he works to cultivate and harvest his orchard. Now with the help of his parents he has been able expand his apple orchard to 7 hectares. Though now he has run into a problem with the machinery he needs. As stated above he had worked out a deal to use the machinery from where he works to cultivate and harvest his own orchard. The problem now is that the machinery he needs is busy during the most important times which are harvest and watering seasons. With the machinery he needed busy during the key harvest time he was unable to harvest his apples in time and most of his apples froze right on the trees which resulted in big losses. For his business to prosper Artur would like to purchase his own agricultural machinery: a tractor, a sprinkler and a plug, all would be second hand. After the purchase of the agricultural machinery he will be able to perform necessary work in the right timing and will be able to bring in a good harvest that will result in profit not losses.

They are led by their group leader Kulsum who is seen standing in the center. Kulsum is 29 years old and is the mother of one child. Kulsum's household income is about 11,000 INR per month. After meeting all the expenses, she is able to save only 2500 INR a month.This is insufficient to give a good education to her only child. Kulsum thus started her own business. She is into selling products made of milk. She sells milk, butter milk, butter, cheese, paneer, curd, etc. In order to give a better education to her child, she wants to earn more and save better. She currently earns 5000 INR a month, which she is not satisfied with. She desires to earn at least 8000 INR a month. For this reason she has decided to avail herself of an enterprise loan. She has also formed a group with similar minded women who are seeking to expand their business. \r\n\r\nThe other women take care of household needs and also pursue individual businesses in order to support their families. On average these women earn 10,000 INR a month out of which they are able to save only 2000 INR after meeting all the household expenses. Similar to Kulsum, they also sell milk products and make a living by selling these products in the market.

While many people find them as useless, Antonio, 54 years old, still finds them as a way to generate a living. \r\n\r\nHere it goes.\r\n \r\nSince trash is not well managed in the country and is just thrown anywhere along the sidewalks and riverbanks, street dwellers usually collect such things that are still recyclable from junk, like copper, papers, plastics and metals. After collecting, their next destination is to the junk shop where they sell such for a corresponding price depending on the material. Usually, metal costs are higher. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries and factories. \r\n\r\nHowever, stable income from this kind of business is hardly predictable. Sometimes, the revolving fund that the junk shop operators use is not enough. \r\n\r\nThis is why Antonio is taking out a loan worth PHP 11,000 to add to his current revolving fund and to use for improving the shop. \r\n\r\nWith her wife, Cecilia, they are truly hopeful that someday their lives will get better and they will be able to renovate their house. He meets up with his co-fellowship** members to share stories of his life and business every week and where he draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1872622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To add up to his current revolving fund and to use for improving the shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-05-06T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-05T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":733.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.69,"local_amount":5133.31,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:55:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5212.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017882},{"amount":83.32,"local_amount":3666.65,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3723.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314297},{"amount":49.99,"local_amount":2200.04,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2234.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696522994}],"funded_date":"2015-05-06T18:06:08Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":879578,"name":"Samah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samah is 25 years old, married, and has three children.

She always dreams to see them get ahead, and it is with them and her partner that they live in their own house. After sending her children to the public school, she starts her workday preparing the ingredients needed to make chicken and ham sandwiches, which she has been selling to her neighbors and acquaintances for the past 5 years. Maria previously received a loan used to build a room for her older son, because she felt that her house was very small. Thus now she is asking for a loan to FUSAI to purchase cement and sand to improve the room built with the previous loan.

is a 27-year-old married woman from Jabalia city. She lives with her husband and two kids in a small house. Her husband works as an employee in the public sector, where his income is low and unstable.

He lives there with his wife and his two daughters. \r\n\r\nSupriyono owns a stall that sells small snacks and drinks and provides mobile airtime credits to his community.

The population of the area is mainly involved with agricultural and handicraft endeavors. There are also small factories that fabricate industrial products. Approximately 60% of the population is indigenous, with the predominate groups being \u201cK\u2019iche\u201d and \u201cMam\u201d.\r\n\r\nNine women have joined together to form the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \"Muro de Bronce\". Irma is the 55-year-old president of the group. She is married and has three children, all of whom are studying in the local university! Irma is an energetic woman and encourages the members of the Trust Bank to be on time to their meetings, to be attentive and to confidently participate. The group is requesting their very first loan that they hope will be funded by KIVA investors. Irma will use her funds to support her food business. She creates delicious dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner. She also takes care of a boarder in her home and would like to purchase two additional beds and linens for them.\r\n\r\nIrma and her friends in the Trust Bank meet monthly with a Friendship Bridge Loan Facilitator who presents participatory educational training for the women in their own indigenous language. Since many of the ladies have had little or no education, they are hungry for knowledge about hygiene, health, women\u2019s rights and the use of medicinal plants. They are eager to gain information about successfully managing and growing their businesses, so subjects like accounting, budgeting, pricing, marketing and customer service are very useful to them. The ladies also learn how to manifest their dreams and set goals. Friendship Bridge calls the effective combination of education and small loans \u201cMicrocredit Plus\".\r\n\r\nThank you, Kiva investors, for learning about Irma and her friends in the \"Muro de Bronce\u201d Trust Bank. They are poised to step into a brighter future, benefiting themselves, their families and their community outside of Quetzaltenango, Guatemala.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3555.17,"image":{"id":1872938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy cooking supplies for her food business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Quetzaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.833333 -91.516667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-05-06T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-05T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":5925,"lender_count":172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia Suzeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvana Suseth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zuly Yadira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Jacaranda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaquelin Gabriela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirna Lisset ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Liliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":45800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":5925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4580.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4580.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4580.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4580.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4580.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4580.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4580.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4580.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4580.2},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4578.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":592.53},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":592.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":592.53},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":592.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":592.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":592.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":592.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":592.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":592.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":592.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1185.06,"local_amount":9160.4,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":9194.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347112},{"amount":592.53,"local_amount":4580.2,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4597.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696557469},{"amount":592.53,"local_amount":4580.2,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:38:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4597.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711472429},{"amount":592.53,"local_amount":4580.2,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:17:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4597.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730991515},{"amount":592.52,"local_amount":4580.2,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":4597.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752079784}],"funded_date":"2015-06-05T13:38:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":877914,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is 63 years old and widowed.

The Microcredit Plus Program of the organization, which effectively combines small loans and education, provides over 22,000 women the ability to do this.\r\n\r\nNine women, dressed in the traditional \u201ctraje\u201d or outfit of the area, have joined together in the rural community of Chunim\u00e1 in Chichicastenango to form  the Trust Bank \u201cChunima\u201d. They have just finished their second loan cycle and are requesting a third loan that they hope will be funded by Kiva investors. The women are quite pleased that they have been able to expand their small businesses and look forward to continuing to do so.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a 66-year-old married member of the Trust Bank who has one son. She has four businesses that include a convenience store, a shop that sells masa to make corn tortillas and tamales, a traditional textile business (traditional blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d, woven belts and napkins) as well as an animal husbandry business (chickens, turkeys, goats). She sells her traditional textiles and animals in the large and well-\u00adknown market in Chichicastenango. With her third loan, Maria plans to purchase items for her convenience store like salt, sugar, chiles, fruits and vegetables as well as laundry and bath soap. She also wants to buy five pounds of good quality thread and fabric for her textile business. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda enthusiastically shares that she really likes to participate in the educational parts of the monthly meetings of the Trust Bank. A Friendship Bridge Facilitator creatively presents training on a variety of useful and relevant subjects like effective business management practices (accounting, budgeting, pricing, marketing, customer service), personal care (health, hygiene, use of medicinal plants), and empowerment (self-esteem, women\u2019s  rights). Friendship Bridge calls the effective combination of education and small loans \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. It allows for more dependable cash flow, increased productivity, increased sales and higher income.\r\n\r\nKiva investors are valued partners with Friendship Bridge in this effort.

With the loan from Kiva, he would like to buy fertilizer. He will use the profits from the business  to pay school fees for his children and to buy a house.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She has a secondary education and, together with her husband, works in animal husbandry and crop cultivation. Thanks to Aiperi's persistent hard work, today she has fifty sheep on the farm. She grows haricot on 0.38 hectares of her own land. Her monthly income is 6,000 som (KGS). In order to continue to further develop her farm, Aiperi applied to the bank Bai Tushum for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy fertilizer, seeds and fuel for land cultivation. Aiperi is a member of the group 'Bai Dykan A4', in which consists of 3 people excluding her, and 4 altogether.

In addition, Sagynbubu has seven cows and twenty sheep on her farm. Her monthly income from the sale of organic agricultural produce, including milk, is up to 10,000 som (KGS).

","en":"Zainab resides in the countryside. She has spent all of her life living in the country and has worked in animal husbandry since childhood. This occupation was passed down to her by her father. Her father also worked in animal husbandry and gave his daughter his cattle. Animal husbandry became the main source of income for Zainab's family. Zainab's husband works in arable farming on his own plot of land of 1 hectare. He plants wheat and maize there. In the winter, he helps his wife on the farm and caring for the animals. The responsibility of buying and selling cattle also rests on her husband. At the moment, Zainab's business needs financial support, and because of this problem she decided to apply to 'Arvand' for support. Upon receiving the money, she wants to buy young cattle and fodder."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1865882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

She has a higher education. Gulira has worked in the clothing trade since 1993, having started this business with 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her tireless hard work, today Gulira has a monthly profit of 17,500 som (KGS), but this is not means enough for a dignified life. Therefore Gulira decided to develop her business and applied to the bank Bai Tushum for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy clothes for resale.

She has two children, ages twelve and ten, and her business is selling vegetables. \r\nShe is a good mother, enterprising, independent, patient, optimistic, responsible and very hard-working. She runs her business in the 'Pedregal' area, known for being the entry point to a commanding view of the city, it has a naturally rocky, monolithic elevation 150 meters high, which stands out in the landscape, it has the form of a large tooth; ascending to its highest point provides a unique view of the city and its surroundings. The vegetation consists of grassy lands and low shrubs. As for wildlife, there are birds such as sparrows and Ave Maria birds. \r\nSusy has a dark complexion, long black hair, brown eyes, and is short-statured and slender. Her native tongue is Aymara which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish in the general culture and for her business. She is in the back row in the photo, second from the right, wearing a pink shirt and brown sweatshirt. She shares her life with her partner who works as a carpenter and with their children; they both attend school. They live in a rented house, constructed of brick, with a corrugated roof, and they have running water, electricity, gas and a sewage system. Because of her dreams to better herself, she joined a communal bank comprised of people with businesses such as: artisanal plaster work, making musical instruments, selling creams, running a neighborhood store, selling food and selling meat; to solicit a loan and improve her business. Her business is selling vegetables such as peas,beans, garlic, onions, black beans, tomatoes, carrots, and pumpkins. She runs her business from her open-air stall seven days a week. \"I learned the business from my mother, I have done it all my life\u2026\" she remarks. The advantage of her work is she is independent, and it allows her time to spend with her family. The disadvantage is the space for her business is small. Her dream is to have a large market stall where she can sell more easily. She would like to buy vegetables at wholesale in order to offer more variety and greater quantities. This is the second loan with the institution in thirteen years dedicated to this activity. \r\nThese are the reasons Susy is requesting a loan to purchase vegetables at wholesale to open a larger market stall.

The Friendship Trust Bank \u201cRayito de Luz\u201d meaning \u201cLittle Ray of Light\u201d is located here. \n\nThere are eight women who make up the group.  In April of 2014, they received their first loan from KIVA.  The women are very grateful to KIVA investors for helping their businesses grow which has had a very beneficial financial impact on their families.  Now they are ready to request a second loan.    \n\nOne member of \u201cRayito de Luz\u201d is 35 year-old Sebastiana who is married and has five children.  Sebastiana sells ice cream at bus stops.  She says that with a new loan, she can buy more products, as well as buy an ice cream cart so that she and her husband can successfully expand their business. \n\n\u201cRayito de Luz\u201d members report that the Trust Bank\u2019s non-formal education segments at their monthly meetings given by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer,  have given them useful tools in their personal and business lives. Some of the topics covered, including self-esteem, empowerment, goals and dreams, have helped the women gain confidence.

For many years, he worked for a multinational company of large consumption and when his contract ran out, he used the money received as the initial capital.  Thanks to that, his business began to function.  \r\nHe is the father of two children, 12 and nine, for whom he works very committedly in order to obtain the hoped-for goods and to offer them well-being.  As such, his family goal is to continue educating his children so they have a promising future.  Although his principal challenge has been to promote strategies in order to counteract the competition, his business has maintained for many years.  \r\nThese days, he is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing that he makes through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo to invest in the purchase of groceries such as rice, brown sugar, sugar, oil, soaps, and other household items.  Yesid considers that this investment will improve his stock of products of high turnover and generate a dynamism in the reinvestment of capital in order to keep the store stocked with groceries.  As a consequence, the customers will be more satisfied to find the things they require in the same place.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1869419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to buy groceries such as rice, brown sugar, sugar, oil, soaps and other household items.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-05-07T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-06T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yesid Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1280000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82511},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92666},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":95446},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":98310},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":101259},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104297},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":107426},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":110648},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":113968},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":117387},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":120909},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":135173}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.32},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.38},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.15},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.59},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Livingston Sutro","image":null}},{"id":880180,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":27.5,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To improve his butcher shop with meat varieties for more income to improve family living standards.

This is Rev. Fr Gervase. He is the Director of Kichwamba High School and Kitabi Seminary School. Kichwamba is mixed school  in the rural area of Rubirizi, with 750 students. Kitabi is a boys\u2019 school in the rural area of Kabwohe in Sheema, with 500 students.\r\n \r\nKichwamba High School and Kitabi Seminary School have requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining two UV water filtration systems to provide clean drinking water for their students. The schools do not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water, and therefore have to spend a considerable portion of their budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing two water filtration systems will save the schools money in the long-term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase two UV water treatment systems with 750 and 450 liter tanks, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nKichwamba High School and Kitabi Seminary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Rev. Fr Gervase ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students' concentration and attendance, by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases, as well as increase the number of students coming to the school.

She has a secondary education.  She is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities which constitute the only source of income for her family and which she started in 1992 when she bought her first livestock for 15,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has four cows and 15 sheep on her farm.  She also grows beans for resale, annually, on 4.34 hectares of land.  Nurchaiym makes an average monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS), which is vastly insufficient for a decent living, since agriculture is her only source of income.  Eager to further grow her business, Nurchaiym has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 150,000 (KGS) to buy one horse and two cows.  This loan will allow her to sell larger volumes of organic milk.

Western Highlands of Guatemala. Tourists from near and far come to admire the beautiful traditional attire of the men and women. It is often quite ornate with embroidered birds and flowers.\r\n \r\nEight women have joined together to form the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Tejedoras\u201d or \u201cThe Weavers\u201d. They have taken loans out from the organization previously and this is the first time they are requesting a loan from Kiva lenders. \r\n\r\n42 year old Juana is a member of the Trust Bank who is taking out her very first loan. She is pleased to be with the other members of the group who have the same needs and concerns as she has. Juana sells beauty products for men, women and children as well as clothing. With her loan, she plans to increase her inventory and purchase creams, lotions, perfumes, rings, necklaces as well as clothing. She knows her clientele and wants to fulfill their desires. With her anticipated income, Juana wants to meet the educational needs of her five children as well as give them nutritious food and clothing. \r\n\r\nAlthough she was not able to complete her education, Juana benefits from the educational segments of the monthly meetings. She, along with the other ladies in the group, learn about nutrition, health, hygiene and the use of medicinal plants. The ladies also gain useful business tools and acquire knowledge about accounting, budgeting, customer service, marketing and pricing.

Entire families, including children, work in these endeavors as life is challenging and all must work to meet the needs of the household. \r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cEstrellas de Tzununa\u201d is beginning their very first loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. Petrona is the 19-year-old Treasurer of the Trust Bank. She is pleased to have this job and to be a member of the Trust Bank as she is acquiring more knowledge and leadership skills.  Petrona is working hard to realize her dreams as she wants to become a successful businesswoman. She fabricates beautiful and colorful bags and delivers them by the dozen each week to different locales. She has three employees who help her with this textile business. Petrona is requesting a loan that she will invest in a large quantity of various colors of thread so that she can increase production. She also would like to purchase four \u201cjocote\u201d trees so that she can sell fruit. \r\n\r\nOn average, Friendship Bridge clients cannot read or write and have had little or no formal education. Their monthly meetings with a Facilitator from the organization, are of great value to the women. The \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program combines microcredit with basic education on everyday topics including budgeting, marketing and sales, nutrition, women\u2019s rights and self esteem. The women are eager to learn and to be successful.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to providing a follow-up report on this new Trust Bank in Tzunun\u00e1.

It is a small Tz\u2019utujil-speaking Mayan village. San Pedro is a tourist destination with a number of Spanish speaking schools.  Because it caters to tourists from Europe, as well as North Americans it has a variety of good restaurants. There are also many different shops including ones that sell typical clothing. The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMayas\u201d is located here. They are completing the loan cycle from July of last year.  All the women have seen their businesses grow. Now they are asking for another loan cycle which they know they can complete successfully because of the Friendship Bridge \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d monthly training they have received and learned about accounting, bookkeeping and customer relations. \r\n\r\nA member of the group is Maria who is 46 years old.  Every day she struggles to raise her six children who are living with her. Maya women wear an apron \u201cdelantal\u201d that has pockets where they keep their money and other important items.  Maria sells these aprons, as well as traditional \u201cfajas\u201d belts that secure the \u201ccortes\u201d skirts the Maya women wear. The aprons and belts are very salable products in San Pedro La Laguna. With the new loan, Maria plans to buy more of the typical fabric to increase her inventory of aprons that she hopes will increase her profits.\r\n\r\nMaria had a difficult childhood and for that reason she does not want to have her children repeat her history.  For that reason she struggles hard in her business to have her children have opportunities for development, especially through education. \r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMayas\u201d

\u201cChitatul\u201d that is beginning their third loan cycle with Friendship Bridge and the very first through Kiva. The Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge, that combines small loans and education, allows these women to have more dependable cash flow, increased productivity and sales, that leads to higher income for their families.\r\n \r\nThe President of the Trust Bank is Cristina who is 39 years old. She has proven herself to be an excellent leader who is a role model for the ladies. She has initiative and determination. Cristina has five children. Along with her oldest son, Cristina has opened an internet cafe that sells school supplies and has a copying machine. Her business is open from Monday through Friday. With her anticipated loan, Cristina plans to fix her copying machine and purchase more school supplies like paper, notebooks and books. With her increased income, Cristina wants to continue to support one of her children who attends the university!\r\n\r\nThe educational segments of the monthly meetings are quite useful for the women. A Friendship Bridge Facilitator shares the trainings in the indigenous language of the women using pictures, drawings, role playing and games. Subjects covered include setting goals, realizing dreams, self-esteem and women\u2019s rights. Other topics include hygiene, health and nutrition. The ladies also acquire valuable business tools like budgeting, pricing, marketing, customer service and accounting.\r\n\r\nThank you, Kiva investors, for learning about Cristina and the Trust Bank.
