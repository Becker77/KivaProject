Une ni\u00e8ce de 21 ans, orpheline, a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie par le couple il y a quelques ann\u00e9es. Jean Claude, aid\u00e9 par sa femme, exerce une activit\u00e9 de vente\/livraison de l\u00e9gumes. Le couple a une s\u00e9rieuse connaissance et une solide exp\u00e9rience de l\u2019activit\u00e9 puisque cela fait 27 ans qu\u2019il travaille dans ce secteur.  Actuellement, Jean Claude livre sa marchandise jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Tamatave (grande ville portuaire de l\u2019est de l\u2019\u00eele, \u00e0 une journ\u00e9e de transport d\u2019Antsirabe) o\u00f9 les l\u00e9gumes poussent mal  et donc, o\u00f9 la demande est forte et le march\u00e9 plus int\u00e9ressant.\nJean Claude est partenaire de Vahatra depuis 4 ans. Avec ce pr\u00eat, il compte notamment acheter une tonne de carottes, une tonne de pommes de terre, une tonne de choux\u2026 et ainsi augmenter toujours le capital de son activit\u00e9.\nDepuis toutes ces ann\u00e9es, les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de son activit\u00e9 lui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 permis d\u2019acheter son propre camion pour les livraisons alors qu\u2019auparavant il devait pr\u00e9voir la location du v\u00e9hicule dans le budget de son activit\u00e9. Il a \u00e9galement r\u00e9ussi \u00e0  construire une petite maison familiale. Son objectif actuel est de continuer \u00e0 garantir l\u2019\u00e9ducation la meilleure possible pour ses 2 enfants restant \u00e0 charge et de s\u00e9curiser autant que possible leur avenir.\n","en":"Jean Claude is a 52-year-old man originally from the countryside. Today, he lives in Commune Urbaine d\u2019Antsirabe with his wife. The couple are raising four children: a girl aged 13 and a boy aged 11 still living at home. An orphaned niece aged 21 has also been fostered by the couple for a few years. \r\n\r\nJean Claude is helped by his wife in operating a business selling\/delivering vegetables. The couple are seriously knowledgeable and have solid experience in this business for having worked for 27 years in this sector. Currently, Jean Claude delivers his goods as far as Tamatave (a large port city on the island\u2019s east side and a day\u2019s travel from Antsirabe). There, vegetables do not grow well, so there is a strong demand, and the market is more advantageous. \r\n\r\nJean Claude has been a Vahatra partner for four years. With this loan, he intends in particular to purchase a tonne of carrots, a tonne of potatoes, and a tonne of cabbage\u2026 thus increasing his capital even more for his business. \r\n\r\nFor all these years, his business profits have already enable him to purchase his own truck for making deliveries when in the past he had to plan for renting the vehicle in his business budget. He has also succeeded in building a small family house. His goal is currently to continue to guarantee the best possible education for his two children still in his care and to secure their future as much as possible. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1872859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a stock of vegetables, such as carrots and potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MG","country":"Madagascar","town":"Antsirabe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-20 47","type":"point"}},"partner_id":359,"posted_date":"2015-05-07T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-06T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jean Claude","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MGA","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200.01,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":611157.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665242832},{"amount":201.69,"local_amount":605060,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":616311.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681549586},{"amount":137.08,"local_amount":411240,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":418887.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696755239},{"amount":137.08,"local_amount":411240,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":418887.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711688317},{"amount":137.08,"local_amount":411240,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":418887.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731191547},{"amount":137.06,"local_amount":411190,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-21T13:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":418836.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":754020141}],"funded_date":"2015-05-07T18:33:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":880494,"name":"Lory","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lory wants you to know that her previous loan helped her improve her profit from her business.

Agnes is a hardworking mother and farmer who is easy to get along with. She hails from the Nkubu area of Kenya. Agnes is happily married and blessed with four lovely children. \r\n\r\nShe passionately loves dairy farming and has been practicing it for the past decade. She has never regretted starting to farm. Her primary sources of income are milk, eggs, and crop farming. Milking and feeding her cows is the most enjoyable part about farming. Agnes is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in her village. Profits from milk sales have enabled her to take care of her family and she has always yearned to produce more dairy milk. \r\n\r\nThe major challenge she faces is feeding her cows. Agnes is requesting a loan to buy a chaff cutter. A chaff cutter is a mechanical device for cutting hay into small pieces to mix together with other forage to feed the cattle. With this loan, her cows will be aided in digestion and they will never reject any part of their food. Agnes strongly believes that proper feeding of the cows will lead to increased milk production, which will translate into more sales and a better income.\r\n\r\nThrough this loan, Agnes\u2019s life is going to change permanently. Because of this high milk production potential, she will save more money to fully repay the loan. She believes that, through careful selection and the application of strict standards of excellence in keeping her dairy cows, she will have more income, which will improve her living standards."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":256.61,"image":{"id":1869047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a chaff cutter, a mechanical device for cutting hay into small pieces to mix with other forage to feed the cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-07T12:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-06T12:20:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":3977.12,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:04:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4123.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665460205},{"amount":34.93,"local_amount":3175.47,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3292.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588366},{"amount":87.91,"local_amount":8122.56,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8421.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.44,"payment_id":711506601},{"amount":45.7,"local_amount":4154.3,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4306.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023469},{"amount":42.88,"local_amount":3898.11,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4041.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111588}],"funded_date":"2015-05-07T18:24:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":877682,"name":"Roberto Jos\u00e9","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Roberto conf\u00eda en que la educaci\u00f3n es la \u00fanica llave, que nos va a llegar al progreso personal y social.  \u00c9l  es estudiante de quinto a\u00f1o de  contabilidad p\u00fablica y est\u00e1 a solo un paso de convertirse en un profesional egresado. \n\nPor ello, solicita un cr\u00e9dito para el pago de un curso de titulaci\u00f3n que le ayudar\u00e1 a graduarse cuanto antes.

For the past 5 years, she has worked in commercial trade and also sells cell phone recharge services. She arrived to the department of Atlantico from Choco, a municipality located in the northeastern part of the country in the Colombian Pacific region, as a consequence of the displacement of that time. She still lives in Barranquilla with her common law husband and her 2 children ages 6 and 9 years old. Yenecid started her business motivated by the need to cover their household expenses. She hasn't stopped since then. She started selling an assortment of inexpensive merchandise among her close friends,  and later she began her cell phone recharge business, taking advantage of the client base she was already attracting.\u00a0Today, she has added products she promotes through a product catalog.  Her goal is to have enough financial resources to increase her client base and earn more later to improve her location infrastructure. Currently she is is applying to a credikiva, the first loan she is requesting from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. With this loan she will buy cookies, sweets, cosmetics, perfumes, hair care products, etc. With this investment she also plans to increase her sales, thus her profits will turn into family earnings to support her family well being in a more consistent manner. All of this will result in the credikiva becoming a successful investment.

When she was 18 years old she traveled to the United States to work. Eight years later she returned to her country and with the money she had saved she bought a micro-bus and worked transporting with her vehicle, After some time she sold it and bought the vehicle she now has.

","en":"Wilmar, 38 years old, from Bol\u00edvar department, arrived in the city of Barranquilla with the goal of finding new horizons. He was employed in a store as a salesperson, however this outsider only lasted three hard years working, then he decided to become independent and open his own business.  He envisioned that a way to get to each of the homes in this city and sell household appliances such as fans, blenders, irons, televisions, sound systems and wooden rocking chairs would be offering them directly to the housewives in their homes. With the confidence that these products are used frequently, they could be acquired through the ease of payments. The sales are done in different neighborhoods in the city from Monday to Saturday on the schedule of 8 am to 6 pm.  He makes his purchases in cash, so he is applying for a Kiva loan, his first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to fill some orders that have been made such as fans, blenders and sound systems. Wilmar is the father of two sons, ages 7 and 6, and two daughters ages 4 and 2. His family goal is to make improvements to his house and in his business to expand his coverage to the municipalities in the Atl\u00e1ntico department.

With ambitious goals of harvesting 50 bags of maize this year, Hauwa can now ensure that her children go to good schools and get a post-secondary school education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1874364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase improved farm inputs that will increase her farm's yields.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-05-07T20:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-06T20:00:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hauwa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":61850,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":61850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-07T20:55:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":880763,"name":"Marian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marian is a woman with three children.
