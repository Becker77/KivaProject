Therefore, Razia has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner\u2019s BRAC Pakistan so that her husband will be able to buy more uniforms to fulfill the demand.\r\nShe is a repeat loan client and has been showing an excellent repayment behavior. She has already been taking loans from BRAC and investing in the business. Her dreams are for the bright future of her children, establishment of the business and for better living standards for her family.\r\n\r\nShe is very thankful to Kiva and field partner BRAC Pakistan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":151.04,"image":{"id":1874422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

The designs are completely improvised and are inspired by our reflections and feelings at the moment that we're working.\r\n\r\nDo not expose these pieces to direct heat or light, as it could soften the adhesive and loosen the beads.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for supporting us as we share our wonderful culture and traditions with the world.\"\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Higinio's Huichol art on the NOVICA site:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/1547"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1090.97,"image":{"id":1158644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to invest in a bulk purchase of glass beads and wax, as well as to hire additional artisans to work at his workshop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tlaquepaque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2015-05-08T12:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-07T12:10:11Z","loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Higinio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.66,"local_amount":30.66,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T16:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":30.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681497941},{"amount":67.95,"local_amount":67.95,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":67.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696704619},{"amount":50.59,"local_amount":50.59,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T17:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":50.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711636754},{"amount":875.23,"local_amount":875.23,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":875.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731141951},{"amount":66.54,"local_amount":66.54,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":66.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752228949}],"funded_date":"2015-05-08T15:14:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":878224,"name":"Edith Orbelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edith de 31 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 hasta 8\u00b0 grado, ella est\u00e1 soltera y vive con su madre y su hermano; su madre se dedica a la venta de tamales y su hermano a la agricultura. \n\n\nEdith se dedica a la venta de tamales, esto lo hace con su madre pues de ella fue que aprendi\u00f3, tambi\u00e9n cultiva la tierra con su hermano; adem\u00e1s 3 d\u00edas de la semana trabaja limpiando pescados en una empresa, toda su vida ha trabajado pues es la \u00fanica forma que le permite superarse.    \n\nElla solicita este cr\u00e9dito para comprar puertas nuevas y ponerlas en su casa, pues se encuentran en mal estado y necesita sentirse segura.\n\n\nSu sue\u00f1o m\u00e1s grande es tener una casa en perfectas condiciones, adem\u00e1s le gustar\u00eda tener su propio negocio y sabe que todo es posible con esfuerzo.\n\n","en":"Edith, 31, studied up to 8th grade.

Chichicastenango is a picturesque large and busy town with red tiled roofs, narrow cobblestone streets and townspeople dressed in very colorful native \u201ctraje\u201d or traditional clothing. The Thursday and Sunday markets are internationally well known and large crowds assemble on those days. There is a lot to see and to buy.\r\n\r\nNine entrepreneurial women have gathered together to form the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cManzaneras.\u201d The ladies are mainly involved in traditional textile production in a variety of brilliant colors. Their goal is to help support the needs of their families.\r\n\r\nJuana is a 36-year-old member of the group and with her anticipated loan, she would like to buy all colors of thread to create the typical ornate blouses that the women wear called \u201chuipiles,\u201d as well as \u201ccortes\u201d or skirts, \u201cfajas\u201d or belts and \u201cchalinas\u201d or shawls.  She sells not only in the local market but also in nearby communities. Juana sells at the retail and wholesale levels.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d program of Friendship Bridge, which combines small loans and education, is very effective. Each month, the ladies learn about everyday topics like health, nutrition, hygiene and how their bodies work. They learn about their rights as women as well as self-esteem. They learn how to dream of a better future and set goals. The group also gains essential business tools learning about planning, budgeting, pricing, accounting and customer service. \r\n\r\nKiva investors are greatly valued in this effort and the ladies of the \u201cManzaneras\u201d Trust Bank are grateful. Thank you, Kiva investors!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3844.14,"image":{"id":1863255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Each month, they meet with a facilitator from the organization. \r\n\r\nSara, a 19-year-old woman, belongs to the \u201cMujeres Chacayense\u201d in a rural area of Solol\u00e1, in the highlands of the country. She has dreams of continuing her studies in the future but because of the high rate of unemployment for teachers in Guatemala due to lack of funds and schools, Sara decided to put her energy into her traditional textile business. She is requesting a loan to purchase many colors of thread and supplies to meet the demands of her customers. She sews not only on a machine but by hand as well.\r\n\r\nThe population of the area conserves their indigenous traditions and customs. Most have had little or no formal education and many do not speak Spanish but rather their own indigenous dialect. Each month, a facilitator from Friendship Bridge shares timely information with the trust bank in their own language. Using games, drawings and role playing, the ladies learn about self-esteem, empowerment, setting goals and realizing dreams. They gain information on getting their children ready for school, health, hygiene and nutrition, as well as women\u2019s rights. Finally, they acquire business tools like accounting, budgeting, marketing, pricing and customer service.\r\n\r\nThese women and their families are poised to step into a brighter and more prosperous future with their small loans and education. In providing the seed money for these essential loans, Kiva investors are greatly appreciated and valued.

Munisa is going to be married soon, but she doesn\u2019t have the jewelry as adornment for the wedding. \r\n\r\nThere is a custom that the bride has to have a dowry and jewelry made of gold. That\u2019s why Munisa is requesting a loan. With the borrowed money, she wants to buy wedding jewelry.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":223.37,"image":{"id":1873340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wedding Expenses","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy jewelry for her wedding ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Dushanbe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.56 68.773889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-05-08T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-07T14:20:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Munisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":199.53},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":216.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":220.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":222.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":236.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":244.27},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":261.36},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":266.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":280.68},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":288.64},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":311.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.16},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.35},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.42},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.78},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.26,"local_amount":199.53,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":208.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665101804},{"amount":36.09,"local_amount":216.55,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":226.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681399930},{"amount":36.8,"local_amount":220.8,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":230.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696610013},{"amount":37.16,"local_amount":222.99,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":232.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711526040},{"amount":39.35,"local_amount":236.12,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":246.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731041800},{"amount":40.71,"local_amount":244.27,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":255.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752130758}],"funded_date":"2015-05-10T21:30:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Idaliya Grigoryeva","image":1834671}},{"id":881117,"name":"Ciriaco","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ciriaco hails from the town of Talibon, Bohol.

She buys several pieces of fishing nets then cuts and makes them into laundry brush nets. Most Filipino households don't own a washing machine. They manually wash their clothes and use a laundry net to thoroughly clean and brush the stains from the clothes. Their laundry net is replaced almost every week. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 700 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Celestina is requesting a 19,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy additional fishing nets to make more laundry brush nets. She thanks God and you in advance for both the financial help that will be extended to her and a good return on her investment which will surely help cover their daily expenses.\r\n\r\nCelestina hopes to grow her business and prosper in life. She prays for a happy and victorious life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

By keeping developing to become a leader in the business, being highly productive and very competitive at a business level, she will improve her level of investments and improve her quality of life.

Sadly, she and her family live in miserable conditions, and her husband has not yet picked a field to work in and cycles through many different jobs from time to time. A few months ago he was working as a laborer for very low wages. Now he wants to drive a rickshaw which he owns, but cannot do this because the body of the vehicle is damaged. Azhra wants her husband to drive it for a living, and has requested this loan to encourage her husband to get it repaired and work in this business. She hopes that her husband will be happy in this profession and work in it for a long time. She is very grateful for the help she is receiving from Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

He is a hard-working man who lives with his life companion and their 2 children, who are 14 and 12 years old. He supports them in their studies, hoping that they can achieve a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nEvery day, Edgar wakes up very early to go to work.

She is an enterprising woman, independent, tenacious, and optimist. She is responsible and she works very hard.\r\n\r\nHer business is located in the southern zone of the city, the most industrialized region, represented mainly by agriculture, livestock, and forestry production. It is the most important hydrocarbon production zone, situated at 437 meters above sea level, with a hot, tropical climate and daytime temperatures ranging from 21 to 34 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nAdda is olive-skinned, with brown eyes and short brown hair that she wears bobbed. She is short of stature with a robust build. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed which is spoken at home, and she also speaks Spanish in the community and for her work. (She is in the center of the photo, wearing an orange and black top with horizontal stripes).\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her family members. They work. They live in their own room built of brick and cement with a corrugated metal roof, and have potable water, electricity, and a sewage system.\r\n\r\nAdda's desire to improve her work led her to form a group of business owners so they could request a loan and improve their businesses, which include a brake repair shop, food sales, nail salon, bed sheet sales, slipper sales, bakery, and dairy sales.\r\n\r\nAdda works as a tailor. She meets with the client to select the textile design, takes the measures, prepares the patterns, and proceeds to cut. After final adjustment of details, she delivers the finished garment. \"Tailoring is like a passion, every day we keep in mind what new design or alteration we might create\", she comments.\r\n\r\nHer advantage in this business is that she has an established customer base due to her years of experience. Her disadvantage is the lack of capital to invest in the purchase of fabrics.

seven children. Her son has been running a small printing press for three years. \r\n\r\nFlex is a sheet of polythene widely used to deliver high quality digital prints for outdoor hoardings and banners, mainly printed by large color plotters. These prints are used instead of hand written banners for their low cost and durability. Her son, who is solely responsible for his own children and his parents, prints advertisement banners and logos on order. \r\n\r\nBecause Shehnaz is sick, she has to spend most of the income on medical treatment. Her son wants to grow his business to generate additional income so he can better care for his children and bear the medical expenses of his parents. Therefore, Shehnaz has requested a Kiva loan so her son can buy polythene sheets and colors plotters to print more flex. In this way, he can easily generate additional income for his family. \r\n\r\nShehnaz deserves Kiva's support, and she is very thankful to Kiva and field partner BRAC Pakistan for this

She had a high school degree and is now retired. Her family\u2019s primary sources of income are livestock breeding and agriculture. Ten years ago she started out with a sum of 20,000 Kyrgyz som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, Gulshan now owns three cows. She grows potatoes and clover on her plot of land the size of 1.41 hectares. Her monthly income is about 8,000 Kyrgyz som (KGS) but this amount of money is not enough for a dignified life.

55-year-old widow and a mother of three children. She has a high school degree. Her family\u2019s primary sources of income are livestock breeding and agriculture. Keneshbu started out back in 2005. Thanks to her hard work, Keneshbu owns three cows. She grows beans for sale on her plot of land the size of 4 hectares. Her monthly income is about 15,000 Kyrgyz som (KGS) but this amount of money is not enough for a dignified life. Keneshbu turned to Bai-Tushim bank for a loan of 100,000 Kyrgyz som (KGS) in order to expand her business. The loan will help her to buy additional livestock and fertilizers for land cultivation and growing organic haricot.
