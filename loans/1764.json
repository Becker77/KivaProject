She is single and has a 5 year old son. Her business is selling traditional food. She is a good mother, enterprising, patient, kind, optimistic, responsible and very hard working. She has her business in the \u2018Tundy\u2019 community, located 25 kilometers southeast of the city. Its inhabitants work mainly in farming activities. The youth and children start working rapidly in order to support their families. Normally, these jobs are related to jobs in the Chacos (pastures), taking care of cattle, and in some cases as nannies or construction helpers in the city. Brigida is of dark skin, with brown eyes, long black hair which she uses tied, short, stocky. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks in her town, and Spanish as general culture and for her business (she is seated on the right)  She shares her life with her small son, who has started school. They live in a house, built with wooden sticks, with corrugated iron roof and electricity. In order to get water, the children must go to the river to get it. Her wish to give her son a better life made her form a group of people with businesses such as: sale of hens, laundry, sale of juices, sale of hats, grocery store, agriculture, sale of milk and sale of wood, in order to request a loan and improve their businesses. Her business is selling traditional food such as: locro carretero cruce\u00f1o (soup made of dehydrated meat, meat cut in small chunks, cassava and egg), Cogote relleno (creole chicken neck, stuffed with potato and \"churiqui\"), peanut soup (soup made with a peanut based broth), stuffed \"locotos\" (bell peppers, chopped meat, onions), rice with cheese (rice, milk and cheese), and other foods. \"The food we prepare is fresh with ingredients we produce, and this gives it an original, local taste...\", she comments. The advantage of her business is that her customers come to the city to look for fresh food and because of this she has many customers. The disadvantage is the lack of furniture and kitchen materials to expand her business. Her dream is to open a restaurant. She wants to buy restaurant furniture such as: tables, chairs, benches and parasols. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 5 years she has been working in this job continuously. These are the reasons why Brigida is requesting a loan to buy furniture to open a restaurant.

Aon is excited that the filter was purchased on an affordable payment schedule and the filter is guaranteed for two years so she and her group can continue to receive the many benefits of clean water for many months to come.

She has a secondary education. She spent many years working as a milkmaid and is also involved in animal husbandry and farming. Thanks to her backbreaking labor and great work, Kishimzhan achieved successes in developing her business and began to earn a monthly profit of approximately 18,000 som (KGS) in addition to her pension payments. Today, Kishimzhan's farm contains 2 cows, 13 sheep, 3 goats and also 4.20 hectares of her own land, where she grows clover for sale. Kishimzhan's earnings are low and not enough for a decent life. To continue developing her business, she requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the Bai-Tushum Bank to buy 2 horses. Kishimzhan plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing her livestock headcount on her farm in order to be able to improve her family's

Abdurahmon has been involved in farming for over twenty years. He has a large land plot of over 20 hectares, where he grows all varieties of grapes. Abdurahmon cleans all the harvest after gathering it and takes it to a market. Because he cannot manage such a large plot of land by himself, his sons help him. Abdurahmon is also involved in animal husbandry. He has 2 cows and 3 sheep. His wife milks the cows every morning and sells the milk at a market.

Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Elma  would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional goods and relative products to sell. At an amount of 50,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of merchandise items like onions, rice, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Elma  hopes to maintain an increasing profit from her business. Through this, she can someday then help other people who are in need. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1875250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

For the purchase of this machine he asks a loan of 300 AMD (Armenian drams), and he will be very thankful to receive it."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":187.11,"image":{"id":1875543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a special grill oven in which he will make tasty meat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Vanadzor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2015-05-09T12:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-08T12:20:04Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tigran","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":14990},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":14360},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":14630},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":15060},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":14900},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":15870},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":15760},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":15940},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":16360},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16860},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":16980},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":17450},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":17690},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":17890},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18330},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18660},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18980},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":19290}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.04},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.06},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.21},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.13},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.38},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.35},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.85},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.27},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.19},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.87},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.54},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.23,"local_amount":14990,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:58:17Z","rounded_local_amount":15009.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665190205},{"amount":29.92,"local_amount":14360,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T16:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":14378.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681496721},{"amount":30.48,"local_amount":14630,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":14648.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696703333},{"amount":31.38,"local_amount":15060,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T17:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":15079.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711635359},{"amount":31.04,"local_amount":14900,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":14919.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731140501},{"amount":33.06,"local_amount":15870,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:30:28Z","rounded_local_amount":15890.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752227402}],"funded_date":"2015-05-24T15:10:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":881463,"name":"Hayarpi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hayarpi is 22 years old and she lives in the village of Zovaber of Gegharkunik region.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nWinner's School will repay the loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Margaret ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne

The school will repay its loan from school fees, which are collected each term. \r\n\r\nMadinah ultimately hopes that access to safe drinking water will improve her students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children who fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students who come to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":418.76,"image":{"id":1875618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

This is Mary. She is the Director of Kakunyu School, a mixed school in the Rural area of Kakunyu in Masaka with 400 students. Kakunyu School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children.

The Group is led by the 53 year-old farmer Nyoman, who is standing far left pointing his two thumbs up and wear a cap at his head. The other farmers in the group are Made, Putu, Ketut, Komang, Wayan, Ketut, Kadek, Made and Wayan. Because Komang were unable to attend at photo-taking process, he were represented by his wife, Ni Nengah, who is holding a piglet. She have agreed to be displayed on Kiva. All of them live in a small village in Sumbawa Besar District, Sumbawa Island, Indonesia. Nyoman has a family with five children. He also is a headmaster of a local Elementary School and member of community society in his village. \n\nNyoman has high hopes for his family and he strives to improve his economic conditions. He was also concerned to see many of the poor farmers in his village. He run a small scale rice farming and also have a small pig fattening business. However, he was troubled with the high price of chemical fertilizers. He is deeply concerned to see the pig dung was wasted without further processing and it polluted the surrounding neighborhood with a pungent odor. His farmland also started infertile because of too much receiving chemical fertilizers.\n\nAfter socialized by YRE and Paroso Mason Group (a local organization, founded by Yayasan Rumah Energi as biogas construction partner) about Household Biogas (BIRU) program, Nyoman saw the biogas program is a solution of his problem. He saw opportunity to reduce his dependence on non- renewable cooking gas. In addition, he also wants to use bio-slurry (biogas residue) as organic fertilizer for his plants to increase revenue and to reduce soil damage of his farmland. Nyoman feel enthusiastic to purchase a bio-digester, but he does not have sufficient capital for it. A loan from Kiva will help him and other group members to make it possible.\n\nHe have an optimism that if he can build bio-digester, he can use the bio-gas for cooking, and bio-slurry (biogas residue) as fertilizer for his plantation. He also hopes that in the future, he can invite the whole farmers in his village to use biogas and also establish bio-slurry related business to create a new job opportunity to his surrounding neighborhood.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":779.17,"image":{"id":1865763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion","Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To build bio-digesters facility and utilize bio-slurry (biogas residues) as organic fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Sumbawa Besar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":423,"posted_date":"2015-05-10T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-09T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":4675,"lender_count":139,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Made","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Komang","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Made","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":61500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":24,"loan_amount":4675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10250000},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":10250000},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10250000},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10250000},{"due_date":"2016-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":10250000},{"due_date":"2017-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":779.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":779.17},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":779.17},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":779.17},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":779.16},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":779.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":779.17,"local_amount":10250000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-19T12:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":10257780.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711703976}],"funded_date":"2015-05-20T11:36:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":881906,"name":"Angelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angelita is 60 years old, married and has five children.

His beginnings were in the neighboring country of Venezuela, where he worked for 3 years as a salesman in a company that sold materials for the production of costume jewelry. Seeing how lucrative the business was, he considered that as an independent agent he would have a better future. He received a loan from the same company to start his own business, which is similar in terms of its activity, yet he would actually produce the costume jewelry, earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and other accessories. His main suppliers are located in Brazil and Venezuela, and they offer him the ability to pay in installments or, depending on his cash flow, to pay in full.\r\n\r\nHis products are offered everyday from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m, to warehouses, traders, or directly to the final consumer. Due to the trust-basted relationship he has with his clients, his sales are payed either in installments or in full. It is for this reason that he is applying for a Kiva loan, which is the first financing he requests from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. He would use the loan to invest in the purchasing of stones of different colors and textures, as well as nylon, brooches, and other accessories.
