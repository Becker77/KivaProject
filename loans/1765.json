She operates her business in the 'La Mutualista' district, a central location characterised by its 30,000 capacity event venue measuring 1,000 metres, where the carnival parades and other cultural activities take place. It has a warm, sub-tropical climate with daytime temperatures ranging from 21\u00b0C to 35\u00b0C. \r\n\r\nVeronica is of average height and medium build. She has dark skin, brown eyes and long black hair that she ties back.

In the photo, she is the third from the left, wearing grey trousers and a top with a flower pattern.\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her husband, who works in transport, and her children.

Driven by her desire for self-improvement, she leads a group of people who are in business, for example, as locksmiths, blanket weavers, cheese manufacturers, fish sellers, bakers, chicken vendors and noodle sellers, to request a loan and improve their businesses. Veronica works as a travelling salesperson, selling catalogue cosmetics.\r\n\r\nThe day begins and she prepares for her daily visits, checks her diary and gets her bag ready.

She is single and has a 4-year-old son. She has a business making wall decorations.\r\n\r\nMariela is a good mother, and she is entrepreneurial, dedicated, fair, responsible, and hardworking. She runs her business in the 'Murillo' area, an industrial part of the city. Her business has all of the basic services such as water, electricity, a sewage system, and gas. The weather is cold and dry in this area, with a temperature that varies during the day between 0-12 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nMariela has light brown skin, brown eyes, and long chestnut-colored hair which she wears down. She is short with a thin physical build. Her native language is Aymar\u00e1 which she speaks with her family, and she also speaks Spanish for general purposes and in her business. She lives her life alongside her son who is not old enough for school yet. They live in a room on property owned by the family, which is made of bricks and cement with a corrugated iron roof. They have potable water, electricity, gas, and a sewage system.\r\n\r\nMariela has a business making handicrafts of EVA and other materials. The scope of her work is broad, and she does cross-stitch embroideries to make doll houses, tablecloths, dolls, and all other sorts of decorations for parties and for the home. \"With the help of a relative, I started my business because of the necessity to become independent and care for my son. I buy my materials at wholesale to make my products and sell them at wholesale as well...\" says Mariela. The benefit of her business is that it's a new type of item that she is selling, made of innovative materials that catch the customer's attention. The drawback of her business is the lack of capital to buy materials.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to increase the production of her business, hire laborers, and increase the variety of products that she sells. She would like to buy materials for production such as EVA, tape, glue, thread, yarn, fabrics, and other things.

The loan will enable the schools to purchase three UV water treatment systems with two 450 liter tanks and a 750 liter tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nThe schools will repay their loan with the school fees that they collect each term. Emmanuel ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases, as well as increase the number of students coming to school. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":918.76,"image":{"id":1876461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

With the received credit, Maia will start purchasing clothing at wholesale prices and will sell in her community with price mark-ups. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family's income and the family members will be able to improve their living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1876640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To develop a stable source of income and sell clothing ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Zemo Chaladidi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2015-05-10T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-09T21:00:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":74.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":82.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":86.41},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":88.18},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":91.04},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":94.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":97.06},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":100.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":103.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":106.84},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":110.78},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":113.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.57},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.2},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.45},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.17},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.29,"local_amount":74.26,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":75.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665093317},{"amount":35.95,"local_amount":82.69,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":83.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681391115},{"amount":37.57,"local_amount":86.41,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":87.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696601414},{"amount":38.34,"local_amount":88.18,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:18:01Z","rounded_local_amount":89.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711520757},{"amount":39.58,"local_amount":91.04,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":92.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731036575},{"amount":316.27,"local_amount":727.42,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":736.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752125423}],"funded_date":"2015-05-20T20:54:20Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:56:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":882117,"name":"Haron","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Haron is a married man and he has 3 children.

Rasim also works as an artisan and gets an insignificant income. The family members live in poverty and have no source of significant income to tackle their financial difficulties. Rasim requires financial support to start his own activity and somehow improve the family's living condition.\r\n \r\nAccording to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. Rasim requested a loan from Credo to start up a new type of business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing  business start-up and re-startup credit with soft conditions to rural poor, who do not have access to credit products as they are considered \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Rasim plans to purchase a hand tractor and also a mowing-machine and start working on private orders.\r\n \r\nThis new business initiative, financed with a Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. Rasim will satisfy his family's increased needs and make a better style of life for his family members.

They have 4 children ages 4, 9, 12, and 15.  Her business involves selling flip flops.  She is a good mother, entrepreneurial, optimistic, patient, responsible, and a very hard worker.  Her work is done in a place called \"El Torno\" which is loacted 32 kilometers southeast of the city of Santa Cruz, Bolivia.  The town is known for its picturesque landscape which is covered in tropical vegetations.  It possesses important forest riches and diverse wild animals.  It is a center for purchasing supplies for the rural area.  It has an annual median temperature of 24 degrees centigrade.   \r\n\r\nClaudia has brown skin, brown eyes, is of medium height, and has long black hair that she wears up.  She is of medium stature and her maternal language is Guaran\u00ed.  She speaks Guaran\u00ed at home and Spanish with the wider population and for work.  (In the photograph she is in the second row, the second from the left, wearing sunglasses on her head).  \r\n\r\nShe share her life with her partner, who works in construction, and with her children, who study in school.  The youngest has not yet started school.  They live in their own room built out of brick and cement with a corrugated iron ceiling. They have electricity and water from a well extracted via a pump.  \r\n\r\nHer desire to get ahead brought her to lead this communal banking group in order to request a loan and be able to continue with her work.  She works selling flip flops, which is a type of sandal made with a sole that stays on your foot through the help of a thong or cord that separates the big toe from the little toes.  Her daily routine begins very early in the morning when she organizes her products in her fixed stall in order to exhibit all of her merchandise.  At the end of the afternoons she collects her umbrella and all of her product to store them until the next day.  \"The flip flops are a very accessible form of footwear because they work well for the warm climate here and the price is rather reasonable,\" She comments.  The benefit of her business is that the climate in her area creates the need for fresh footwear and her customers are regulars.  The disadvantage is the competition.  Her dream is that her children can become professionals.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to expand her business through the purchase of flip flops in bulk in order to stock her business and open another stall for sales.  This is the third sequence of loans that her group has requested in the two years that she has been working in this business.  For these reasons Claudia is asking for a loan in order to purchase flip flops in bulk to supply her business and open another stall.

She started a sari-sari (mini- grocery) store with a capital of 8,000 PHP. Their primary customers are their neighbors. She was able to manage it well, and able to finance the daily needs of her family with the help of Paglaum Cooperative, of which she became a member in April 2006. She was able to avail herself of three loans and repaid them religiously. Now, she applies for a loan of 20,000 PHP to finance the additional stocks of basic commodities for her sari-sari store.

caluroso, por lo que no es extra\u00f1o ver que los habitantes disfruten y se refresquen con su familia en alguno de los cinco balnearios, o bien en uno de los diez r\u00edos locales. \n\n   Casa de Dios es un grupo conformado por habitantes de dicha localidad, y el nombre lo eligieron debido a la fe que profesan, ellos son doce integrantes: Benita vende carne de cerdo, reposter\u00eda y cosm\u00e9ticos; Alida, calzado y cosm\u00e9ticos; Ruth, art\u00edculos de plata  y cosm\u00e9ticos adem\u00e1s de criar cerdos; Aracely, ropa; Odilia, perfumes; Antonio y Josu\u00e9, tacos; Roc\u00edo, gelatinas, hielitos y refrescos. De igual modo Blanca realiza tejidos; Jos\u00e9 hace tortillas y es fot\u00f3grafo; mientras que Guadalupe maneja una tienda de abarrotes y Blanca Isabel, una est\u00e9tica.\n\n   Para Isabel el estilismo es una pasi\u00f3n que desarroll\u00f3 desde muy peque\u00f1a: \u201cdesde ni\u00f1a siento amor por el servicio de est\u00e9tica, jugaba con mis mu\u00f1ecas a cortarles el cabello, peinarlas o maquillarlas\u201d. Posteriormente estudi\u00f3 en una academia de belleza en donde perfeccion\u00f3 su t\u00e9cnica con base en la pr\u00e1ctica. \n   Desde hace siete a\u00f1os construy\u00f3, con la ayuda de sus padres, su propio negocio, que abre de nueve de la ma\u00f1ana a nueve de la noche. Chabe, como es mejor conocida, brinda servicio de cortes de cabello, manicura, pedicura, depilaciones y tines adem\u00e1s de ofrecer servicio a domicilio. \n   Gracias a las ganancias obtenidas pudo comprar materiales y mobiliario indispensable para su negocio; pero lo m\u00e1s importante es que ayuda a su madre con los gastos de la casa. En esta ocasi\u00f3n invertir\u00e1 el pr\u00e9stamo en la compra de tintes, per\u00f3xido, cremas, peines, acr\u00edlico, una secadora y una silla para ni\u00f1os. Asimismo planea remodelar la est\u00e9tica e instalar aire acondicionado para mejorar el ambiente en el establecimiento. \n   El grupo Casa de Dios agradece esta gran oportunidad con la cual pueden mejorar su calidad de vida. Chabe agradece en especial el apoyo que se le ha brindado pues con ello ha realizado el sue\u00f1o de tener su propio negocio. \n\n*La fotograf\u00eda se tom\u00f3 en la est\u00e9tica de Isabel quien viste blusa color rojo. \n","en":"\"La Novia del Sol\" (bride of the sun) is a community in Veracruz known for its warm climate.  So it is not strange that the local people enjoy refreshing moments with their families in one of the five spas or ten local rivers.\r\n\r\nThe communal bank \"Casa de Dios\" is a group made up of people from this community.  They chose the name because of their faith.  There are 12 members: Benita who sells pork, bakery products and cosmetics; Alida, shoes and cosmetics; Ruth, silver items and cosmetics, and raising pigs; Aracely, clothing; Odilia, perfumes; Antonio and Joshue, tacos; Rocio, jello, ice and refreshments.  Other members are Blanca who weaves, Jose who makes tortillas and is a photographer; and Guadalupe who runs a grocery store; and Blanca Isabel who is an esthetician.\r\n\r\nBeing a stylist is a passion Isabel has developed since she was very young:  \"Ever since I was a little girl I have loved my profession.  I used to play with my dolls and cut and style their haird and put make up on them\".  Later she would attend beauty school where she learned the technique based on practice.\r\n\r\nSeven years ago, with the help of her parents, she started her own business which opens at 9:00 a.m. and closes at 9:00 p.m.  Chabe, as she is better known, offers hair cuts, manicure, pedicure, hair removal and hair color, and also provides in-home services.\r\n\r\nWith the profits she has earned she has been able to buy necessary materials and furniture for her business.  But most importantly she has been able to help her mother with the household expenses.  On this occasion she will use the loan to buy hair color, peroxide, creams, combs, acrylic, a dryer and a chair for children.  She also plans to renovate the salon and install air conditioning to improve the environment.\r\n\r\nThe Casa de Dios group is grateful for this great opportunity to improve their quality of life.  Chabe is especially grateful for the support she has received which has allowed her to realize her dream of having her own business.\r\n\r\n*This picture was taken at Isabel's salon.  She is wearing a red top.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6100,"image":{"id":1853682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Now it\u2019s time for you to meet one of Ruma agents, Syafrohmanuddin. Syafrohmanuddin lives in Pekalongan, a city located in Central Java, about 2 hours from Jakarta by plane. Syafrohmanuddin owns a stall that provides mobile payment services for his community.  He learned about Ruma from Ruma\u2019s sales executive who came to his stall. He decided to join Ruma because he wanted to learn more about how to improve his business using technology. His community sees Syafrohmanuddin as a friendly person, that\u2019s why it\u2019s really easy for him to attract customers.\n \nSyafrohmanuddin has become an agent for Ruma\u2019s layaway product designed for lower income communities called 'Mapan'. Mapan enables customers to save up, little by little, by depositing change at agents and as their balance grows, it allows customers to make major asset purchases like housewares, appliances, and school supplies for their children.  \n\nAs a Mapan agent, Syafrohmanuddin is responsible for processing deposits from customers into their Mapan accounts as well as receiving orders from customers who want to buy products listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer orders, Syafrohmanuddin will submit the order via SMS and within 5-10 days, the product will be delivered to the customer. With Mapan, Syafrohmanuddin believes that his community will be able to have access to higher quality products with better prices. \n\nAs the business grows, Syafrohmanuddin is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. Having known about the importance, your loan will be very useful to help Syafrohmanuddin improve his business and accordingly, his community who needs access to such services.  As seen in the photo, Syafrohmanuddin is the one who is sitting. He thanks you for your kind support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1872177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Mobile Technology"],"use":"to increase the working capital deposit needed to help community members save for big purchases through Ruma's layaway product called Mapan.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Pekalongan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-05-11T08:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-10T08:00:03Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Syafrohmanuddin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":12000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":879001,"name":"Miriam Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La elaboraci\u00f3n de manualidades es todo un arte, lleva mucho tiempo y dedicaci\u00f3n, pero la satisfacci\u00f3n que da ver el producto final, borra toda fatiga y el cansancio.

They cultivate different crops and sell the gathered harvest in the local markets. Now they are thinking of cultivating a crop which is profitable and a round the year crop. So they have decided to grow paddy on their farmland. But they have inadequate capital to invest in their business; thus they need some financial help to develop their business. \r\n\r\nDipti has applied for a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner). The requested loan is very important for Dipti to be able to purchase fertilizer and seeds for paddy cultivation. The loan will greatly help this family to organize cultivation work, and they hope for a good harvest.  They hope it will be a lucrative business as the crop has a tremendous demand in the market.

She is 20 years old, single, and lives in her parents' house. She attends the university in the area.
