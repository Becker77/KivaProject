One of the distinctive entities in the area is the prison, which provides a major source of employment. On its outskirts are many stalls of fried fish, wraps, \"enchipotlada\" dishes and soups, just to mention a few. There, one can enjoy an excellent meal and an unrivalled panoramic view of the region.\r\nPalomitas is a women-only group of seven: Julia sells shoes; Paloma and Araceli sell food; Floribertha and Margarita sell drinks; Amairani sells clothing; and Griselda has a business as an aesthetician.\r\nPaloma was born with a love and taste for cooking. For this reason, two years ago she started a business selling traditional appetizers and tamales. In the mornings she sells at a local school, and in the afternoons she returns home to continue selling her rich dishes.\r\nShe lives with her parents and three sisters. The whole family helps with the household costs. They are all very united, so it is not unusual to see them helping each other with their businesses. \"I give thanks to my family, which supports me unconditionally in my business. Without my mother and sisters, nothing would be the same\" says Paloma, with a smile on her lips.\r\nFor Paloma, there is no greater motivation than to become a productive person. This is how she obtains the necessary income to satisfy her needs and provide for those she most loves. With this loan, she will purchase meat, chillies, butter, cream, oil, napkins, and disposable plates. These are basic ingredients and supplies for her business.\r\n*The photo was taken in Paloma's store. She is pictured wearing a pink shirt with blue shorts."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":1862364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy meat, chilis, butter, cheese, cream, oil, napkins, and disposable plates.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Miguel Soyaltepec, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-05-11T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-10T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paloma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Floribertha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Araceli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Griselda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amairani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":41000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2562.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":993.78,"local_amount":15375,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":15470.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597635},{"amount":662.5,"local_amount":10250,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:20:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10313.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682141026},{"amount":828.1,"local_amount":12812.5,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:55:59Z","rounded_local_amount":12891.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768160},{"amount":165.62,"local_amount":2562.5,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2578.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701215}],"funded_date":"2015-05-11T19:14:09Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T19:35:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":882655,"name":"Maribel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maribel is 30 years old, married and has 5 children.

Su negocio lo desarrolla en la zona \u2018plan 3000\u2019 caracterizada por la colonizaci\u00f3n de migrantes; tribus ayoreas nativas del lugar y mineros relocalizados de occidente se apropiaron del lugar e iniciaron la manufactura y el comercio en todas las \u00e1reas, de clima c\u00e1lido tropical muy h\u00famedo, con una temperatura que var\u00eda durante el d\u00eda entre 18-35 grados cent\u00edgrados.\nMarioli es de tez morena, ojos pardos, cabello negro largo lo usa amarrado estilo cola de caballo, baja estatura, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica delgada. Su lengua materna es el Guaran\u00ed que habla en familia y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y por el negocio que realiza (sentada; la primera de la izquierda, viste solera color lila con rayas horizontales blancas). Su vida la realiza en casa de sus familiares que es propia construida de ladrillo y cemento con techo de calamina que cuenta con agua potable, energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y alcantarillado. Su sue\u00f1o de superaci\u00f3n para el bienestar de su hijo la llev\u00f3 a formar una banca de personas con negocios como; venta de pollo a la broaster, venta de verduras, comercio de art\u00edculos de limpieza, venta de embutidos, librer\u00eda, carnicer\u00eda, venta de ropa de segunda mano y venta de carteras, para solicita run pr\u00e9stamo y mejorar sus actividades.

La ventaja de su negocio es que la atenci\u00f3n es continua durante toda la semana por eso los clientes la escogen, la desventaja es la falta de capital de inversi\u00f3n para mantener el negocio abastecido. Su sue\u00f1o es abrir un mini supermercado, ella dese ampliar su negocio mediante la compra de art\u00edculos y alimentos de primera necesidad para abastecer la tienda y abrir un mini supermercado.

Her business is selling food and daily use items in her neighborhood store. She is a good mother, decisive, enterprising, happy, independent, friendly, responsible and hard-working. Her business takes place in the 'Plan 3000' area which is characterized by it's colonization by immigrants. Ayoreas Native tribes from the area and miners relocated from the West and settled in this place and started manufacturing and commerce of all types. The climate is hot and tropical with a daily temperature that varies during the day between 18 and 35 degrees Celsius.<br \/> <br \/>Marioli is dark-skinned with dark eyes, long black hair she ties back in a pony tail, short in stature and thin. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed that she speaks in her family and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and for her business. (in the photo she is the first to the left wearing a lilac colored shirt with white strips). She lives her life in the house of family members build of brick and cement with a metal roof, electricity, running water and sewage. <br \/><br \/>Her dreams of excelling for the well-being of her son led her to form a communal bank with people with businesses like selling roasted chickens, selling vegetables, a cleaning product business, selling cold cuts, a bookstore, a meat shop, selling used clothing and selling handbags to request a loan to improve their businesses.<br \/><br \/>Her business is selling food and daily use items like bread, sugar, milk, eggs, biscuits, soft drinks, noodles, rice, etc. She does business during the day every day of the week. \u201cI opened my store out of the need to pay for my child, it is an enslaving business but at the same time she don't lack our daily food.\u201d she commented. The advantage of her business is she is open continuously during the week so clients choose her. Her disadvantage is the lack of capital to invest to keep the store stocked. Her dream is to open a mini-supermarket. <br \/><br \/>She wants to expand her business by buying food and basic use items to stock her store and to open  mini-supermarket. This is her first loan with the institution in the 3 years she has been in this business. For these reasons Marioli is requesting a loan to stock her neighborhood store and open a store to pay for the expenses of her son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":1871817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Its fruits have the same name and resemble a star if they are seen crosswise. In the house where \u201cLos Carambolos\u201d (\u201cThe Starfruit\u201d) group meets, there are three trees of this type, which is why the members decided to call themselves by this name. The fourteen members are: Isabel and Ana, who sell traditional snacks; Maria, who sells pigs; Agustina, Alica, and Sonia, who sell bread; Rosal\u00eda, who sells cosmetics; Blanca, who sells plastic containers; Gerardo, who sells bread and drinks; Hugo, who sells herbicides; Samuel, who sells bread; Valent\u00edn, who sells fertilizers; Ma. De Lourdes, who sells plastics; and Oscar, who manages a carwash. \r\n\r\nThe family of Sonia is made up of Leopoldo, her husband, and three children, all of whom continue with their education. The goal of providing a better future to her family is what motivated Sonia to start a bakery seventeen years ago. Her husband has been her teacher, and together they manage this business now. \r\n\r\nSonia\u2019s bakery starts its work from 4 in the morning. While her husband and son prepare the dough and the other ingredients, she starts the ovens and prepares the necessary utensils. Once this is all ready, she delicately begins making each piece of bread. It should be noted that during celebrations, such as the Day of the Dead and the Three Kings Day, her job is very important, since they make the famous bread rolls and the traditional king\u2019s cake pasty for each occasion.\r\n\r\nSonia also has a fixed vision of continuing to grow professionally. She says that she doesn\u2019t only want to continue making bread, but she also wants to make pizza and vol-au-vents; she is already taking courses in a school. Thus, she will be able to offer her clients more options.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Sonia has invested in equipment and raw materials for the best way to make bread. At this time, she plans to buy flour and sugar, since they are the ingredients that are most needed in her work. \r\n\r\n* The photograph was taken in front of the Isabel\u2019s house.

Walking along the tracks, one can see the fields full of sugar cane and rubber plants, which are the biggest crops, but also crops of lemons, beans and maize. This is a clear indication of the richness of the soil. \r\n   \r\nWithin this community a group of nine women formed, all of whom have the same characteristics: hard-working, committed, honest, responsible and, above all, happy. This is where the name of the group came from: La Alegr\u00eda [Happiness]. The members are: Reyna,  Rosa and Teresa, who sell groceries; Reyna, who sells Mexican snacks; Andrea, who sells stationary products, groceries and drinks; Yazmin and Karina, who sell confectionery; Rufina, who sells handicrafts and bread, and finally Marcela, who sells fish. \r\n\r\nWhen she became a single mother six years ago, Teresa had to look for a way to cover the costs of her house and educate her four children, two of whom are minors. She started by selling bread, fish and tamales as a travelling sales person, but this didn't leave her much time to spend with her family so she decided to start a grocery store. She has now been doing this for four years. To begin with she offered her products on a table and now, with the earnings that she made and with the support of her family, she has built a wooden shop, which has made her very happy. \u201cThe shop is the heritage of my family, for my children I will work as hard as I can\u201d, she says. This is demonstrated by the fact that her children are still studying.\r\n \r\nTeresa finds being able to earn her own income thanks to her business very satisfying, so she wants to invest the loan in buying more merchandise, in particular drinks of different flavours, biscuits and snacks.\r\n\r\n*In the photo, Teresa is dressed in a red top.

Andi lives there with his wife. He owns a stall where he sells mobile phone accessories and mobile airtime credits. He learned about Ruma from Ruma\u2019s sales executive, who came to his house. Andi's community sees him as a friendly and trusted mobile provider. Andi feels happy that he joined Ruma because he can now contribute more to his community.\r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Andi is hoping to get working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to process more mobile airtime credits and bill payments for members of his community. Your loan will be very useful to help Andi improve his business and, accordingly, his community, which needs access to such services. \r\n\r\nAndi\u2019s goal, in the near future, is to serve as an e-commerce business for his customers by offering Ruma's latest product, called Mapan. \r\n\r\nIn the photo, Andi is standing in his own stall.

He graduated primary school and couldn't continue studying because his parents did not have the financial resources. \n\nCurrently he makes his living in agriculture, the farming of blackberries, which he sells in nearby street markets and nurseries of the community. The blackberries that he cultivates don't need to be fertilized with chemicals; they are 100% natural products. Because of this he has customers that go to his home to purchase blackberries. \n\nIn addition, he raises animals such as pigs, chickens, and guinea pigs, and with this business covers his home costs. \n\nLuis has 4 children to whom he is giving an education so that they are not subject to the same circumstances as he was.

Installing a water filtration system will save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

Leonard hopes that having access to safe drinking water will not only improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases but also increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":690,"image":{"id":1875775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Masaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-05-11T21:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-10T21:10:14Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.95,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leo's School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5160000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":345},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":345}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":342.87,"local_amount":1032000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-24T12:11:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1033275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.13,"payment_id":681370937},{"amount":339.18,"local_amount":1032000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1033275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.82,"payment_id":755507187}],"funded_date":"2015-05-17T23:26:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Schindler Marlow","image":null}},{"id":882854,"name":"Tareq","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tareq, 34, lives with his wife and one child in Ramallah.

The inhabitants frequent its water to cool off and to spend enjoyable time with family.\r\n\r\nIn that town, there are very beautiful sunrises, which is why a group of nine people decided to name themselves that way: Sol Naciente (Rising Sun).  The group is made up of: Martha, who manages a grocery store; Antonia, a beautician; Fidela, a taxi driver; Alejandra sells tamales; Emilia, natural products; Jose, soft drinks; Maricela, limes; while Dulce and Paula farm pigs. \r\n\r\nAlejandra is a friendly woman who always wants to give the best of herself in taking care of her family. She is in a happy marriage with Telesforo, which has produced four children, of whom only one depends on them: a 12-year-old who is in secondary school. \r\n\r\nAle, as she is known in her community, has been selling delicious tamales for three years.  The process is arduous, but the result is worth the effort. From buying the ingredients to preparing the flour to giving form to each tamal, it is a process that takes approximately a whole day. Once the product is ready, she goes out to sell in the streets near her place until everything is gone. The customers are very satisfied by the great seasoning and the excellent treatment. \r\n\r\nOn occasion, her customers make special orders, which makes her happy. She has made as many as 1,000 corn tamales, 500 dumplings, and 1500 ranch-style tamales.  Now her husband will plant corn with which she can improve her prices, since it is the main ingredient of her business.\r\n\r\nThe loan opportunity will help her to purchase lard, pork, chicken breasts, chili peppers, and firewood. The business is going really well, which is why Alejandra plans to buy a corn mill in the future.  That way she can improve her revenue.\r\n\r\n*The picture was taken in Emilia's home. Ale is the one who has a blue bucket in her hands, where she carries the tamales.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":1868295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase lard, pork, chicken breasts, chili peppers, and firewood.

She is doing great with the loan, working for just a few hours but can manage to get a good profit.  \r\n\r\nShe appreciates Kiva for the support she has received. She used the profit to pay school fees, loan repayment, bought a plot of land, started building her house, and covered household expenses.

She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings is their source to meet their daily expense and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nEmelyn hopes to maintain and grow her grocery store to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life.

She thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations, she is requesting a loan of 20,000 PHP to buy the latest models and styles of cell phones, laptops and tablets to expand her product inventory. This will definitely boost her earnings as she expands her business.\r\n \r\nHermelita hopes to rent a stall in their town's commercial area. She prays that God will prosper her business to meet her family's growing needs. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

It also has a very important cultural and historic heritage, as exemplified by the pyramids that stand in the area. The month of April is very important for the inhabitants of the area because this is when they celebrate their patron saint with dances and various religious acts.\r\n\r\nThe group \u201cEstrellitas\u201d is from this community. The members chose the name because at night, due to the low levels of light, the stars are visible in the sky. The current members of the group are: Cesarea, who sells clothing; Transita, who sells sweets; Brisa, who sells cosmetics; Rosario, who sells soft drinks; and Rosa, who sells typical snacks. In\u00e9s and Zacar\u00edas run a small grocery store, and Zacar\u00edas also has a corn dough grinding mill. \r\n\r\nZacar\u00edas is happily married to Hip\u00f3lita, with whom he has five children, who are all now grown. He lives in one of the neighborhoods farthest from the center of town, so he takes advantage of being able to work in the fields. He has been cultivating and harvesting corn for ten years. Previously, in order to grind his corn, he had to ride his bicycle to a corn grinding mill all the way in the center of town; this is why he decided to buy his own equipment. In this way, he saves time and he can rent the grinding mill to his neighbors. Now, Zacar\u00edas\u2019 mill gets used thirty to forty times per day.\r\n\r\nWith the profits from his business, for example, he has someone break up the rocks that make his mill stronger so that the corn dough comes out with a finer texture. This, in turn, results in happy clients. This time he has requested a loan because he needs to invest in rice, beans, soups, cooking oil, eggs, and toilet paper in order to start a new business\u2014his own small grocery store. \u201cThe stores are very far away. So, I\u2019ll open one in my house, and that way people won\u2019t have to go so far to buy,\u201d he explains enthusiastically. Zacar\u00edas hopes to keep both businesses growing. \r\n\r\n* The photograph was taken in Rosa\u2019s house.

","en":"San Miguel de los Bancos is a canton of love. It has a warm humid climate and many rest sites that are visited by national and foreign tourists.  It is located in the northwest of the Pichincha province.  Very nearby, within the same .83 km, is the New Town area.  The traditions of this area are the festivities carried out every year in December in honor of the Virgin of Los Remedios [the Virgin Mary].\r\n\r\nThis area is where Se\u00f1ora Nancy lives and has a business.  She is a hard-working woman who is 34 years old and a single mother of three children for whom she fights every day and betters herself in order to give them everything necessary for their preparation.  Like many women, she is the head of the household and has to work alone so that her children lack nothing.\r\n\r\nShe makes a living raising pigs.
