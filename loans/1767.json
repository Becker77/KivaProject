It is also the name of the group formed by four working women from a community in the state of Mexico which still maintains the languague, culture and traditions of its ancestors.  The local people have a profound respect for the earth which provides the food they need to survive.\r\n\r\nIn the group, Silvina and Maria Ignacia run embroidery businesses, and Margarita and Eugenia have a grocery store and a school supplies store, respectively.\r\n\r\nMargarita is known for being very cheerful and everyone calls her Mago.  She has been married to Fortino for 18 years and they have four children who attend school; two in high school and two in junior high.\r\n\r\nTo help cover household expenses, Mago started selling groceries in her community.  She used to put an array of products on a cart and go out into the streets to sell her merchandise door to door.  She did this for three years, but with the help of VisionFund Mexico she was able to build a store so her business has grown considerably.  This has given her the confidence to continue and seek a new loan. \r\n\r\nMago always tries to stock a variety of good products but she worries about competition.  With the help of the loan she can stock her store with the most popular items such as milk and sugar.  Mago's goal is to continue supporting her children in their studies so they can become professionals.  She also wants to acquire a vehicle to transport the groceries more easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n* The picture was taken in the municipal garden.  Margarita is the one holding a napkin she made.  She also makes and sells crafts for extra income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1872794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy groceries such as milk and sugar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SAN NICOAS GUADALUPE, SAN FELIPE DEL PROGRESO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-05-12T07:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-11T07:10:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Ignacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":258.34,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4016.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597653},{"amount":258.34,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:20:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4016.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682141044},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4016.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768178},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4016.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701231},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:57:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4016.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204344},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4016.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291814}],"funded_date":"2015-05-18T19:04:27Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T19:27:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":882959,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is widowed with six children and they all go to school.

El crecimiento fue gradual pero a prisa, en un s\u00f3lo a\u00f1o logr\u00f3 establecer dos puestos y actualmente ya cuenta con cuatro; en cada uno de ellos trabajan dos empleados.\n   Roberto est\u00e1 muy contento por dar trabajo a otras personas. Sin embargo, debe ausentarse de casa durante varios d\u00edas debido a que las ferias se realizan pueblos aleda\u00f1os y se prolongan durante varios d\u00edas. Por otro lado, existe mucha competencia pero Don Roberto se muestra confiado \u201cYa hay muchos panaderos y es m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil obtener buenas ganancias pero tambi\u00e9n ya son muchos a\u00f1os de experiencia y el buen sabor es el que nos identifica de los dem\u00e1s\u201d. \n   Con el pr\u00e9stamo que ha solicitado comprar\u00e1 harina, huevos, levadura, az\u00facar etc. para continuar con el trabajo y hacer su sue\u00f1o realidad: expandir el negocio con el prop\u00f3sito de apoyar econ\u00f3micamente a sus hijos en sus carreras profesionales. Su hijo mayor estudia la preparatoria y quiere ser dentista; otro, doctor; una de sus hijas, asistente de vuelo; la otra ni\u00f1a, a\u00fan no lo decide y el m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o dice que quiere continuar con el negocio de su pap\u00e1. \n   Los dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Yeny quien invertir\u00e1 en un cibercaf\u00e9 mientras que Mayte y Ofelia invertir\u00e1n en el negocio de pan de feria. Todos est\u00e1n muy agradecidos por la oportunidad de recibir un pr\u00e9stamo.\n\n*La foto fue tomada en el jard\u00edn del municipio aparecen los cuatro integrantes*\n","en":"Roberto lives in a community in Mexico which is known for its cheerful, hard-working attitude.  He is the father of five children who continue their education.\r\n\r\nComing from a generation of bakers, Roberto maintains the trade and delicious flavor of his products.  When he decided to form a family he had to start his own business.  At first he had nothing but his father helped out by lending him an oven, a few pans and a small stall.  That is how he started selling bread at markets.  In less than a year, Robert was able to pay back his father since his business was running perfectly.  Growth was gradual but speedy and in only a year he was able to establish two stalls.  Now he has four with two employees at each one.\r\n\r\nRoberto is very happy to provide work for other people.  However, he must be away from home at certain times because of the markets that have to be set up in neighboring villages and last several days.  There is also a lot of competition, but Roberto shows confidence, \"There are many bakers and it is hard to make a good profit but I also have many years of experience and a distinct flavor which sets us apart from the others\".\r\n\r\nHe plans to use the loan he is requesting to buy flour, eggs, yeast, sugar, etc. to continue his work and reach his goal of expanding his business in order to support his children in their professional careers.  His eldest son is in high school and wants to be a dentist; another one, a doctor; one of his daughters, a flight attendant; and the other daughter still does not know.  The youngest wants to continue the business that his father has set up.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Yeny who will invest in a cybercafe, and Mayte and Ofelia who will invest in their bread businesses.  All the members are very grateful for the opportunity of receiving this loan.\r\n\r\n*The picture was taken in the municipal garden and all four members are present*\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5025,"image":{"id":1761219,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase flour, eggs, yeast, sugar, and other ingredients.

The most common varieties in the area are: carachi, mauri, ispi, trout and more. His day begins very early in the morning when he goes on the lake to put in the nets to bring them in after a couple of hours. He does this activity every day of the week during the fishing season. When the season is over, he works in agriculture. \"Right now we sell fish. When the fishing season is over, we work the land and keep livestock\", he says.

","en":"Elmira, 50, is a widow and has a son who lives with her. She has a high school diploma and in the past twenty-five years has been earning her living from livestock breeding and land cultivation. She has three cows. In addition, she owns a 4.40 ha plot of land where she grows clover. She sells the clover to both wholesale and retail buyers. Elmira also sells large volumes of delicious organic milk, which is in high demand. Elmira is requesting a loan of 50,000 Kyrgyz som (KGS) from Bai-Tushum bank in order to buy a dairy cow and so increase the volume of organic milk sales.

Through years of hard work and dedication she has steadily grown her business from one outlet to 15. Currently, Sandra has 22 employees working at her 15 locations throughout the copperbelt province, Zambia. Upon receiving her first Kiva loan Sandra was able to invest in her working capital to grow the business by serving more customers needing to send and receive money. In time, she opened three additional outlets with her increased profits. \r\n\r\nSandra talks about how, by reinvesting back into the business, she was able to earn more commissions and with her increased revenue, open new locations. Some locations may not be profitable for up to six months but in time all of Sandras\u2019s outlets have become profitable. Having access to finance has fueled Sandra\u2019s expansion and allowed her to provide 22 jobs in Zambia where employment is very difficult to find. Sandra is happy now because she is able to provide well for her family and pay for her tuition fees.\r\n\r\nShe is currently pursuing a bachelors degree in banking and finance. The mobile money business has improved her and her family's income and well-being greatly. Sandra is married and has a two and a half year old son. Now, Sandra is requesting her fourth Kiva loan to purchase to expand her business further.

This may include information on training needs and opportunities, job descriptions, performance reviews and personnel policies of the Council.\r\n\r\nRayselyn is the breadwinner of her family and she helps her parents by providing for their daily needs. She simultaneously maintains their household and does her job, for she desires to give her siblings a better life in the future.\r\n\r\nBut one of her dilemmas, like any other employee, is the proper budgeting of salaries with their daily needs. Aside from this, she has to pay their weekly and monthly expenses plus her siblings's tuition fee, which she sometimes forgets because she needs to prioritize more important matters.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Rayselyn is asking for your assistance to support her financial inadequacy. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in returning it back, since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day. She looks forward for any help that would come from you and she promises to return it in due time. She will be using the loan to pay her siblings's school fees.\r\n\r\nRayselyn has a very unique dream and that is to become a singing flight attendant. She aspires to have a job that she could enjoy and at the same time share that joy through entertaining people to whom she would be offering her services. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\nThe Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.

Her dream is to open a restaurant, she wants to expand her business through the purchase of cooking utensils such as cutlery, silverware, pots, etc., and also some tables and chairs. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 1 year she has been doing this work. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons Gladys asks for a loan to purchase utensils and kitchen furniture to sell food to more customers to pay for her daughter's school expenses.

Even at her young age, she already has engaged herself as a Human Resource Officer.  She is responsible for providing support in the various human resource functions, which include recruitment, staffing, training and development, performance, monitoring, and employee counseling. She also provides advice and assistance to supervisors and staff. This may include information on training needs and opportunities, job descriptions, performance reviews, and personnel policies of the Council.\r\n\r\nCaylene handles different challenges every day at work and that what makes her to be more determined and focused to what she is doing. She is hopeful that a good life awaits her family, which is why she pushes herself beyond her limits and is willing to do extra miles. The problem is that she lack resources at times and her salary is not quite enough to provide for her needs and help support her family.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Caylene requested a loan from CCT Credit Cooperative, which she will use to pay for the educational needs of her siblings. She will have no problem repaying the loan as the loan payment is deducted every pay day.  \r\n\r\nCaylene meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and how God is continuously transforming her life.\r\n\r\nThe Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.

She has been selling provisions and groceries since five years ago, when, determined and armed with her savings upon arriving in Barranquilla, she found that there was a great demand for staple goods in her neighborhood; what the community required was not offered. It spurred her to start a business with which she could start to generate income, supporting her spouse in family sustenance, which up to that moment had been his sole responsibility. \r\n\r\nToday, her business has gradually grown, but her work capital is not sufficient to achieve her dreams. It is a major challenge to invest and earn more, because some of the goals she has are to offer better quality studies to her son and, finally, to have a home with an adjacent store. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she is applying for a Kiva loan, which is the first financing she has requested from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With the loan, she will purchase provisions and groceries like rice, meat, and soft drinks, among other items that are frequently purchased. She does not want her inventory to be insufficient when the customers arrive to buy from her. With this investment, she plans to impact her sales and increase the inventory of items, making her Kiva loan a successful investment. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":328.69,"image":{"id":1865770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to purchase provisions and groceries like rice, meat, and soft drinks, among other items.

Peace hopes that in the future she will be able to own a boutique. \r\n\r\nPeace is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Stella is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kayunga in the Mukono region of Uganda. For the past five years, Stella has been working hard to manage her agriculture business, which sells cash crops. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Stella has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more cash crops, and will help Stella to generate greater profits and increase capital. Stella hopes that in the future she will be able to start a retail shop. \r\n\r\nStella is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

She is 22 years old and lives in the town of Lugazi in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is married and has two children with one of them currently in school. For the past four years, Eva has been working hard to manage her clothing business, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Eva has requested a loan of 950,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes, and will help Eva to generate greater profits and improve her standard of living. Eva hopes that in the future she will be able to own rental units. \r\n\r\nEva is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

years old, married, and has five children (a son and four daughters). Munarakan has a secondary education. In search of additional income for her family, she started 11 years ago to raise livestock and crops. Thanks to her hard work, Munarakan currently has on her homestead one cow, four calves, ten sheep, and one horse. She also has a 1.0-hectare plot of land, where she grows potatoes and corn to sell.

Kamoliddin has a secondary education. Work in the village is difficult to find. He works part-time seasonally in construction, but one must support a family and bring up children adequately.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water, and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will save the school money in the long-term because they won't have to buy firewood.

mexiquense. Los integrantes eligieron el nombre porque cerca de donde viven, hab\u00eda una peque\u00f1a granja con ese nombre. En aquellos a\u00f1os, los habitantes se dedicaban al cultivar ma\u00edz y a criar caballos que eran el medio m\u00e1s usual de transporte. Ahora lo \u00fanico que prevalece de la granja es el port\u00f3n con su nombre.\nDo\u00f1a Adela es una de las integrantes del grupo, tiene 74 a\u00f1os y a pesar de su edad a\u00fan se siente motivada para seguir invirtiendo en sus actividades: la cr\u00eda de animales y su tienda de abarrotes. El pr\u00e9stamo lo utilizar\u00e1 para mantener la tienda bien surtida, comprando detergentes, productos enlatados, leche, queso, az\u00facar, huevo, pan y refrescos. Fue hace 13 a\u00f1os que do\u00f1a Adela abri\u00f3 su tienda que est\u00e1 ubicada frente a un pante\u00f3n, lo que ayuda a mantener ventas altas por las personas que visitan o llevan flores a sus seres queridos que los han dejado.\nEl desaf\u00edo de Adela es la competencia que hay alrededor, sin embargo la atenci\u00f3n a los clientes y el surtido siempre han ayudado a mantenerla. Adem\u00e1s por una u otra raz\u00f3n, la competencia siempre ha terminado cerrando mientras que la tienda de Adela ha prevalecido durante estos a\u00f1os. Incluso, pensando en seguir creciendo ella planea mejorar el local y comenta entre risas \"mi changarrito necesita una buena mano de gato para que quede presentable\".\nTodos los integrantes del grupo se muestran muy agradecidos por la oportunidad de recibir un cr\u00e9dito ya que su dificultad general es tener el capital adecuado para seguir invirtiendo.  Miguel, Manuel, Fernando, Severiano y Mar\u00eda del Roc\u00edo son los dem\u00e1s miembros y ellos utilizar\u00e1n su cr\u00e9dito para comprar borregos.\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el municipio, junto al taxi de Don Fernando, su actividad principal. Do\u00f1a Adela, es la se\u00f1ora de mayor edad en el grupo.\n","en":"Rancho Caporal is a loan group in a Mexican town. The members chose the name because there was a small farm of the same name near where they live. In the past, the inhabitants made a living growing corn and raising horses, which were the normal means of transport. Now, the only thing that remains of the farm is the gate with its name.\r\n\r\nAdela is one of the group's members. She is 74 years old and despite her age, she still feels motivated to continue investing in her activities raising animals and running her grocery store. She will use the loan to keep the store well stocked, buying detergents, canned goods, milk, cheese, sugar, eggs, bread and soft drinks.\r\n\r\nAdela opened her shop 13 years ago, and it is located opposite a pantheon, which helps to keep sales high due to the people who visit it or bring flowers for their loved ones who have passed on.\r\n\r\nAdela's challenge is the competition around her. However, her customer service and her stock have always helped her. In addition, for one reason or another, the competition has always ended up closing while Adela's shop has prevailed over the years.

For the past two years, Florence has been working hard to manage her small kiosk where she sells snacks. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Florence has requested a loan from BRAC Uganda for 700,000 Ugandan Shillings. She will use the loan to buy more snacks to increase her sales and generate greater profits. She will be able to attract more customers and manage to buy a plot of land. Florence hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a tailoring machine. \r\n\r\nFlorence is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She is a widow and has three (3) children aged 18, 13 and 10 years old.\r\n\r\nIn 1983, Kadie established her palm oil and gari (cassava flakes) business.  She began her business because she wants to take good care of her children. She has taken her second loan and she repaid it well.

For the past 2 years, Annet has been working hard to manage her charcoal business, which sells sacks of charcoal. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Annet has requested a loan of 500000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more sacks of charcoal to increase her stock and will help Annet to generate greater profits and to use the profits to complete her unfinished house. Annet hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land to contract rental houses. \r\n\r\nAnnet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Linet is 18 years old and lives in the town of Nakifuma in the Mukono region of Uganda. She has one child. For the past 2 years, Linet has been working hard to manage her charcoal business, which sells charcoal in her small stall. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Linet has requested a loan of 600000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to increase more stock in her business by adding more sacks of charcoal, and will help Linet to generate greater profits and invest more in her business. Linet hopes that in the future she will be able to manage to build a very big commercial house. \r\n\r\nLinet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She has a son, who is thirteen, and two daughters, ages ten and eighteen. She is an enterprising and independent woman, a good mother, and a persevering and dedicated hard worker.\r\n\r\nShe works at a permanent fruit stand, located in Tejar, an area in the northwestern part of the city where there is lots of business activity and trade moves over $500,000 a day. The weather is cold and dry and temperatures during the day range between 4 and 15 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe has dark skin, brown eyes, and black long hair with some grey, which she wears pulled back. She is short and of medium build. Her native language is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks at home, and she also speaks Spanish, which she uses in general and for her business. She lives with her husband, who works as a driver, and their children, who go to school. They live in their own home, which was built with bricks and cement, with a sheet metal roof. The home has electricity, water, and sewer. Her business is selling wholesale fruit. Local farmers come to her stand to deliver large quantities of fruit, which she stores and sells at wholesale prices. Her daily routine starts early in the morning when she brings out the fruit in order to arrange and display it, picking the best-looking pieces so they look fresh and healthy.\r\n\r\n\"I started my business as a street vendor, but then I bought a permanent stall and I'm still trying to continue to improve,\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she has regular customers, and the main disadvantage is that she doesn't have enough investment capital to offer larger quantities of her product.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand her business and open a second fruit stand. She wants to buy seasonal fruit like strawberries, medlars, bananas, oranges, tangerines, lemons, grapefruit, and other wholesale fruits, in order to open her new stand. This is her fourth loan cycle through this organization, and she has twenty years of experience in her business.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Guadalupe is requesting a loan to buy wholesale seasonal fruit. She will open a new fruit stand and help her children finish school.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":379.34,"image":{"id":1873716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy wholesale seasonal fruit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-05-12T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-11T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":45.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":65.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":71.9},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":73.05},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":80.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":80.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83.86},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":89.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.84},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.51},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":99.01},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":102.87},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":106.45},{"due_date":"2016-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":110.75},{"due_date":"2016-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":109.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.51},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.62},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.86},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.84},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.51},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.01},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.87},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.45},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.75},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.51,"local_amount":45.51,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":45.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046679},{"amount":60.99,"local_amount":60.99,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":60.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344506},{"amount":65.26,"local_amount":65.26,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":65.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554718},{"amount":62.72,"local_amount":62.72,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":62.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468804},{"amount":71.81,"local_amount":71.81,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":71.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296641},{"amount":73.05,"local_amount":73.05,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":73.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076831}],"funded_date":"2015-05-30T06:43:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":879757,"name":"Jalpa La Bella Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jalpa la Bella es un nuevo grupo de pr\u00e9stamo en VisionFund.

He was always accustomed to this trade because his parents are also artisans. \"This is an activity that is transmitted from generation to generation,\" says Rafael, full of pride.\r\n\r\nHe always wanted to start his own business, that is why, with the help of his parents, he was able to buy the necessary materials for the creation of the clothing. Afterwards, with the earnings he obtained, he bought more materials and with these he increased his production.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole year he makes the clothes. What his customers most request are caps, scarves, gloves, stockings, and vests. Despite the fact that his sales practically only occur in winter, Rafael strives to always have his merchandise ready so that he won't disappoint any of the customers who place orders with him.\r\n\r\nAround these dates, Rafa, as he is called by his fellow group members, tries to increase his production and therefore the loan would help him to buy hangers, yarn, and needles.\r\n\r\nRafa's entrepreneurial vision makes him think of the future and to get more customers by the end of the year.

Sometime the car battery runs out during the night time. After seeing her neighbor's  shop use a solar home system to sustain their business day and night without lacking of energy, Theavy decided to apply for a KIVA loan to buy a solar home system.

This is why he is requesting a loan, together with a group of people with the same needs, to invest in buying agricultural supplies for maintaining his crop. Diego remains hopeful that he will obtain this loan, allowing him to produce a good maxan harvest this year and so increase his income and continue to support his children through school until they are great professionals."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1873737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy supplies for the cultivation of maxan plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2015-05-12T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-11T20:40:03Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diego","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-22T05:29:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matthew Kingston","image":1765400}},{"id":882233,"name":"Afi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Afi est une femme mari\u00e9e \u00e2g\u00e9e de 37 ans qui vit \u00e0 Adamavo avec ses quatre enfants.

","en":"Khamidamo is a resident in Khamadoni district. She is only 21 years old. She is married and has one child. Khamidamo is a farmer. She has worked in the agricultural business for three years. She decided to work in this business because her parents also were in this very sphere of work.

A large part of the population works in corn cultivation and animal husbandry.<br \/><br \/>Adelina, 54, is married to Juan and they have 7 children, of which only the youngest is still in elementary school.<br \/><br \/>For many years, Adelina worked in animal husbandry, fattening animals such as pigs and lambs, a business that she left to her one of her sons so she could give herself fully to her business of selling clothing.<br \/><br \/>Adelina's mother made traditional mazahua garments, a skill she learned, too, and then decided to turn it into a business. At first, Adelina only had 3 outfits to sell as she didn't have enough capital to buy more material. Currently, Adelina has s sewing machine that helps her create the colorful traditional garments of her region that she sells in her locale. Also, this loan will help her have sufficient thread, needles and yarn to continue creating.<br \/><br \/>Taking advantage of the space of her establishment, Adelina also sells modern clothing, gifts, hair accessories and even the same raw materials she uses to make clothing, like needles, thread and yarn. However, Adelina is always looking to increase sales, so she also sells in other places: \"I also sell in plazas and open air markets, in a little kiosk and it's in those kinds of places that I sell more and earn more\u201d. <br \/><br \/>Adelina is grateful for her loans, since her first business, the loan helped her grow and thanks to that effort she now has her clothing store. With her earnings, she was able to build two houses for her family and her children were able to get ahead. Despite these achievements, Adelina still desires to get ahead with her business and continue supporting her husband with the household expenses.<br \/><br \/>The other members of the group are Ren\u00e9 who will invest in raising and fattening of animals, and Valeria and Rosa who will invest in their embroidery.<br \/><br \/>*This photo is of the four members in Adelina's store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1873034,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"buy raw materials, like fabric, thread, needles, yarn, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Nicolas Guadalupe, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-05-12T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-11T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rene Rolando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valeria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3546.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597667},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:21:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3546.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682141062},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3546.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768196},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3546.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701247},{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3546.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204357},{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:27:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3546.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291821}],"funded_date":"2015-05-18T18:07:26Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T19:27:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Yuste","image":1669109}},{"id":883525,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna, 54, is a mother of one child.

Thanks to her knowledge of esthetics,  she decided that the best way to occupy her time was to work in what she liked most.  She leased the space where her beauty salon is, she added hair dresser chairs, mirrors, and manicure and pedicure tables to provide a comfortable service. Every day from 9am to 9pm, the inhabitants of the neighborhood that she lives in, southwest of Barranquilla, can request a haircut, color, blow dry manicure and pedicure -- the hours are long so there's enough time to enjoy her services. The products she uses in the beauty treatments are bought wholesale and in cash. She's requesting a Kiva loan, first one she is requesting from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, to invest in shampoo, massages, hair color and the other products she needs to provide a quality service. With this loan, Desi will increase her sales and assortment.

It's members work in the following businesses: Aracely sells food, Rosa sells backpacks and clothing, Miriam sells silver items, Anayeli and Margarita sell clothing and shoes, Ana sells perfumes and desserts, Deysi sells traditional snacks, Osman sells hosiery, and Mar\u00eda sells backpacks and clothing. \r\n\r\nRosa is a hardworking and enthusiastic, 22 year old woman.  She lives happily with Ricardo, her partner of one year. She became a business woman seven years ago, selling candy from the porch of her house.  She remembers placing her merchandise on an antique table that her mother had.  Everyday after school, she would arrange her candy, and she would tend her store while she did her homework.  This allowed her to help her mother with the household expenses as well as earn a little extra spending money.  After four years of that, Rosa decided to start selling backpacks, luggage and handbags, which she purchases in a neighboring town as well as in the capital.  She also sells pit bull puppies, and recently, she started selling men's clothing with her sister. She splits the sales with her 50-50.  \r\n\r\nRosa is now seeking a loan because she is about to go on a trip to purchase more merchandise such as, backpacks for children and handbags.  Rosa's dream is to have a set retail location and offer a wider assortment of products at unbeatable prices for her customers, so that she can be successful in her business.\r\n\r\nThe picture was taken outside of Anayeli's home.

","en":"Cirpa, 43, lives in Cartagena with her partner and two children, aged 12 and 15. She sells ice cream and also has dedicated sellers who sell her product for her. She started her business 2 years ago, when a friend suggested that she generate income autonomously. Sirpa didn't have to think twice and started her business and little by little it's been growing.

En un barrio localizado entre los ca\u00f1ales se form\u00f3 un grupo llamado \u201cLos Cocos\u201d nombre que los  integrantes eligieron por el gusto que tienen por el fruto. Ellas son: Teresa R., Marcelina, Teresa M. y Felipa dedicadas a la venta de pollo; Laura, a la venta de ropa y dulces; Reyna, a la venta de refresco y material de reciclaje y finalmente Trinidad quien vende perfumes.\n\n    Do\u00f1a Reyna es una mujer ejemplar, ha conformado junto con su esposo Enrique una gran familia de seis hijos. El hecho de ofrecer una mejor calidad de vida a los suyos hizo que, desde hace treinta a\u00f1os, se uniera a la actividad de su esposo: la compra y venta de material de reciclaje. Es una labor complicada pues hay quien mira con desd\u00e9n este negocio, sin embargo hoy en d\u00eda eso no afecta a Reyna ya que es una manera muy honrada de ganarse la vida, adem\u00e1s comenta con gusto \u201ccomprar y vender chatarra no tiene nada de malo, al contrario reducimos la contaminaci\u00f3n\u201d. Su jornada es de lunes a s\u00e1bado cuando recorren diferentes comunidades en busca del material para comprarlo y transportarlo hasta su localidad en donde la revenden. Con las ganancias obtenidas solventan los gastos de su hogar, el estudio de sus hijos y han formado un patrimonio. \n   De igual modo, hace siete a\u00f1os Reyna decidi\u00f3 invertir en la compra de refrescos para revender, actualmente contin\u00faa con esta actividad de la cual obtiene ganancias extra. Ahora solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar agua mineral y refrescos de distintos tama\u00f1os y sabores con motivo de la temporada de primavera y verano, \u00e9poca en la que la temperatura de la regi\u00f3n aumenta a\u00fan m\u00e1s.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en la tienda de do\u00f1a Celia quien es hija de do\u00f1a Reyna, ella est\u00e1 vestida con blusa y falda de color rosa.  \n","en":"In Oaxaca there is a municipality whose name is the combination of two Nahuatl words: \u201cAcatl\u201d which means \u201ccane\u201d and \u201cTlan\u201d which is  \u201cplace of\u201d or \u201cland of\u201d, so the name of the place is \u201cland or place of the canes\u201d. This is one of the main regions for sugar cane production, and there are two important periods of activity. The \u201czafra\u201d (or cane harvest) is when the cane is ready to be processed and the \u201creparaci\u00f3n\u201d is when production facilities are maintained.\r\n\r\nIn one neighborhood among the cane fields, a group called \u201cLos Cocos\u201d (the Coconuts) was formed. The name was chosen by the members because of how much they like the fruit. The members are Teresa R, Marcelina, Teresa M. and Felipa, who all sell chicken; Laura who sells fruit and sweets; Reyna, who sells refreshments and recyclable materials and finally Trinidad, who sells perfumes.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Reyna is an exemplary woman. Along with her husband she has formed a wonderful family of six children.  With the aim of offering a better quality of life to her own, she joined her husband in his occupation thirty years ago. This occupation is the buying and selling of recyclable materials. It is complicated work because some look down on this business, but this doesn\u2019t ruffle Reyna, because it is a very honorable way of earning a living. Furthermore, she says enthusiastically that \u201cthere is nothing wrong with buying and selling junk, on the contrary, we reduce contamination.\u201d Her work week runs from Monday to Saturday when they go through different communities in search of material to buy and transport to their location, where they resell it. With the earnings that they get they\u2019ve been able to cover the household expenses and their childrens\u2019 studies and create some assets. \r\n   \r\nAlso, seven years ago, Reyna decided to invest in buying refreshments for resale. She continues with this activity currently as a way to earn extra money. Now she is seeking a loan to buy mineral water and drinks of different sizes and flavors for spring and summer, when the temperature in the region rises even higher.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in do\u00f1a Reyna\u2019s daughter do\u00f1a Celia\u2019s store.

It is very peaceful, surrounded by by leafy tree. Its residents are characterized by their friendliness. Because not all roads that lead there are in good condition, several people can still be seen riding horses to get to the more distant places. The main economic activity in the area is growing corn and raising sheep, among other animals.  \r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9s is one of the members of the group. He is a very hardworking man. He is 47 years old and with Patricia has a family with six children. Only three of them are dependent on the couple. \r\n\r\nPreviously, Andr\u00e9s was a merchant in the Mexico City. Unfortunately, he became ill and had to return to his community. \u201cI've really always liked working in the fields with the animals. If you know the activity well, you can get a lot of profits\u201d. That is why 10 years ago, Andr\u00e9s decided to start to raise and sell sheep, chickens and turkeys to make the necessary earnings to support a family.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, Andr\u00e9s also sells wood that some people in community don't use anymore. It's generally used to cook food, because its gives it a distinct flavor. With the loan, he will be able to buy sheep and feed to keep them in good health. The more an animal weighs, the more Andres' profits increase.  \r\n\r\nThe rest of the members of the group are Viviana and Sarai, who will invest in chicken,  Abraham and Fidel, who will invest in sheep, and Francisco, who will invest in pigs. \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken by the arches of the town center.

She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she has had no problem repaying as the loan payments are deducted every pay day. She looks forward to your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to pay the tuition for her children since enrollment for another school year is fast approaching.\r\n\r\nSusan dreams of giving her children a better life and future. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.
