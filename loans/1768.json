She lives with her partner, has a 2 year old child, and her job is in medicine. She is a good mother, independent, friendly, easy-going, responsible and hard-working. She does her job in the location of \"El Torno\" where the majority of the residents make a living growing yucca and bananas. They also extract lime powder close to the river to sell it in the city. The city has a hot subtropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 16-23 degrees Celsius. Jessica has dark skin, brown eyes, long black hair that she wears tied back, a short stature, and a thin physique. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks with family and she speaks Spanish in public and for her work (in the picture she is standing, the third from the right, wearing a black jacket with pink stripes). \r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her partner who is an employee and her son who has started walking. They live in a rented room made of brick and cement with a tin roof and which has electricity and well water that is extracted through an electric pump. They do not have sewerage. \r\n\r\nThe need to enlarge her business for the benefit of the community propelled her to lead a bank of people with businesses such as: selling traditional boiled soft drinks, motorcycle taxi service, appliance repair, selling second-hand clothing, a bakery, selling fruit and selling food, in order to ask for a loan and improve their jobs. \r\n\r\nHer job is nursing. She works as a nurse in a nearby hospital and she also has a small office at home where she gives injections and some medical attention to patients with work-related injuries or sicknesses like flus and colds. Her community is far from the city and finding a doctor or a hospital is difficult and sometimes impossible. \"I studied nursing and I work in a hospital. I set up a small doctor's office to help my community and I need to supply it with instruments and basic medicines...\" she says. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she is doing something good for her community. The disadvantage is the distance and lack of money to supply her office with the medicines and medical instruments. Her dream is to help improve the health of her community. She wants to buy basic medicines to cure and treat outpatient sicknesses such as colds, flus and others to help heal the illnesses of the residents of her community. \r\n\r\nThis is the 1st loan with the institution in the 5 years that she has worked as a professional nurse.

She lives in Silang Cavite, Philippines with her husband and three children.

She directly supervises and coordinates the activities of production and operating workers, such as inspectors, precision workers, machine setters and operators, assemblers, fabricators, and plant and system operators. \r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Maricar is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses. They have no access to savings or credit, a situation that makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Maricar is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to any loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying them since the loan payment is being deducted every payday. She looks forward to your positive response, and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to pay for the acquisition of land ownership.\r\n\r\nMaricar prays to God for her family's everyday guidance and strength especially for her child who is working overseas. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1031.25,"image":{"id":1879165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay for acquisition and ownership of land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-05-13T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-12T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maricar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:55:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4184.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017929},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":8333.34,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":8368.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314347},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":8333.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":8368.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523044},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":8333.34,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":8368.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433476},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":8333.34,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:36Z","rounded_local_amount":8368.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954438},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":8333.34,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:02Z","rounded_local_amount":8368.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044415}],"funded_date":"2015-05-19T12:54:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":883637,"name":"Umeda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Umeda is a skillful woman.

crecido y mi familia me ha ense\u00f1ado que todas las cosas son posibles si nuestro esfuerzo es del mismo tama\u00f1o que nuestros deseos de lograrlas, sin importar las adversidades que se presenten y los sacrificios que estos impliquen.\n Desde muy peque\u00f1a me siento atra\u00edda por la medicina porque considero que es una de las profesiones m\u00e1s gratificantes, ya que no hay mayor satisfacci\u00f3n que poder ayudar a los dem\u00e1s y tener la oportunidad de por medio de mis conocimientos mejorar sus padecimientos y ayudarles a preservar la posesi\u00f3n m\u00e1s preciada que poseemos que es la vida. Mi familia no posee los recursos necesarios para costear mi carrera debido a que la \u00fanica fuente de ingresos proviene de mi padre y el dinero que este produce apenas es suficiente para nuestro sustento, mi madre no trabaja ya que ha sido sometida a varias intervenciones quir\u00fargicas y su delicado estado de salud se lo impide, raz\u00f3n por la cual la aprobaci\u00f3n de este pr\u00e9stamo es no solo necesaria sino tambi\u00e9n esencial ya que de no obtenerlo no me fuera posible realizar mis estudios.\nLos empleos que espero obtener luego de terminados mis estudios universitarios son aquellos que me permitan emplear los conocimientos y habilidades adquiridos y ponerlos en pr\u00e1ctica, ya sea en el sector p\u00fablico de salud o en alguna instituci\u00f3n privada que me d\u00e9 la oportunidad de desarrollarme como la m\u00e9dico ejemplar y destacada que deseo ser, mis metas  acad\u00e9micas est\u00e1n basadas en obtener buenas calificaciones por medio de mis habilidades y disciplina, ya que deseo realizar una especialidad m\u00e9dica y las calificaciones obtenidas durante los estudios universitarios son tomadas en cuenta a la hora de elegir los participantes, y  mis metas personales son las de convertirme en ejemplo de superaci\u00f3n para mi familia y modelo a seguir de las futuras generaciones, ser una profesional confiada en mis capacidades y conocimientos para que as\u00ed mis pacientes se sientan seguros al momento de dejar en mis manos su salud y la de sus familiares, tener los ingresos econ\u00f3micos suficientes para as\u00ed ayudar a mis padres y mejorar su estilo de vida. En este momento el \u00fanico desaf\u00edo que se interpone para lograr mis metas es la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica de mis padres, ya que me considero una persona capaz de lograr las cosas que me propongo y estoy dispuesta a poner todo mi empe\u00f1o y esfuerzo para alcanzarlas.\n","en":"Paula Lisibel is a young medical student. She is asking for a loan to be able to cover her educational expenses.  This is her story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Paula Lisibel.  I\u2019m 18 years old. I live with my parents and my sisters in a humble part of Puerto Plata province, where I was born.  This is also where my family has taught me that all things are possible if our efforts are as great as our desire to achieve them.  It doesn\u2019t matter what obstacles turn up or the sacrifices they require.\r\n\r\nFrom a very young age, I felt drawn to Medicine because I consider it to be one of the most gratifying professions.  There is no greater satisfaction than being able to help others and to have the opportunity, through my knowledge, to improve their afflictions and help them to maintain the most precious possession we have\u2014life.  My family doesn\u2019t have the financial resources needed to pay for my degree.  Our only source of income is from my father, and it is barely enough for our support.  My mother doesn\u2019t work because she has had to undergo various surgeries and her delicate state of health makes it difficult.  This is the reason to approve this loan.  It is not only necessary but essential; without getting it, it wouldn\u2019t be possible to complete my studies.\r\n\r\nThe jobs that I hope to get after finishing my university studies are those that will allow me to use my knowledge and skills and put them into practice.  This could be in the public health sector or in a private institution that would give me the opportunity to develop as the exemplary and outstanding physician that I hope to be.  \r\n\r\nMy academic goals are based in getting good grades through my abilities and self-discipline, because I want to complete a medical specialty and the grades one earns during one\u2019s studies are taken into account when it\u2019s time to select participants.  My personal goals are to become an example of self-improvement for my family and a model for future generations to follow.  I want to be a trusted professional with regards to my capabilities and my knowledge so that my patients feel safe when they put their health (or that of their family members) into my hands.  Finally, I want to earn an income that is sufficient to help my parents and improve their quality of life.  \r\n\r\nAt this point in time, the only challenge in front of me to achieve my goals is my parents\u2019 financial situation, because I\u2019m thought to be someone who is capable of achieving the things I propose to do, and I am included to put all my efforts and determination to work achieving them."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1873863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

A credit support from Tujijenge, Kiva's partner, supported Joyce to start her business.\r\n\r\nThis is her third credit request from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loans to replenish her genge with more fruits and vegetables. She has paid back her previous loans successfully.

Maria has a business making and selling cakes. Maria is a great mother, she is independent, generous, understanding, responsible and hard-working. \r\n\r\nMaria has developed her business in the South zone, a place famous for constant population growth and plenty of commerce. In this region different cultures and ethnicities from all over the country come together.

They live in their own home made from cement and bricks with a calamine roof, they have running water, electricity and sewage. \r\n\r\nThe need to expand her business led Maria to join a group of people with businesses such as: a welding workshop, crockery, second-hand clothes, bedding, transport services and cell-phones, to seek a loan and improve their businesses. Maria's business is the making and selling of Queque. Queque is a cake made from flour, eggs, milk and sugar that you can eat at any hour, by itself or with coffee or tea. Maria started this business in her home, with a small investment of money, selling alfajores and vanilla and chocolate cakes, which have ingredients that are easily found in the market. In this way Maria recuperated her capital, and invested in offering desserts to her customers \"my business grew like a ball of snow, I baked as much a I could and then went out to sell\", Maria says.\r\n\r\nThe positive of Maria's business is that the cakes are very agreeable and you can eat them anytime of day, the negative is that she lacks the capital to buy wholesale ingredients. Her dream is to open a bakery, Maria wants to buy wholesale: different types of flour, sugar, eggs and the other ingredients she needs for her business. \r\n\r\nThis is the first sequence of loans with the institution in the two years that she has been involved.

The area has a production of citrus fruits of 5,000 hectares. The area has a sub-tropical climate, with a temperature that varies during the day between 18 and 24 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nMaida has brown skin, brown eyes, long black hair that falls to her shoulders, a short stature, and a medium physique. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family; she speaks Spanish for daily life and for her work. In the photo, she is in the middle, seated on the chair.\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her partner, who works as a driver, and with her son, who just finished school, work, and prepares to study.

They do not have indoor plumbing. \r\n\r\nThe need to grow her business to improve her income drove her to lead a loan group with people who have businesses such as selling cheese, selling milk, providing motortaxi services, selling traditional drinks, selling second-hand clothing, running a bakery, selling fruit, and selling food. The group requests a loan to improve their businesses. \r\n\r\nHer work is selling traditional baked goods, such as \u201ccu\u00f1ap\u00e9,\u201d which is a bread roll made from cheese and yucca flour; it is small and is usually eaten mid-day and mid-afternoon, with a hot drink or by itself. She says that in her land, from 5 in the afternoon (after the afternoon nap), the small pastries are eaten, accompanied by a frothy coffee. The advantage of her business is that the clients have a habit of eating baked pastries of this kind. The disadvantage is her lack of capital to buy flour, cheese, and other ingredients. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to open a bakery. She wants to buy different types of flour, cheese, yeast, milk, and other ingredients wholesale to increase her production and sell more pastries. This is her third sequence of loan with the institution in the four years that she has been doing this work.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Maida requests a loan to buy flour and other supplies wholesale to bake more small pastrics and open a bakery. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4150,"image":{"id":1873873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy flour and other supplies wholesale to bake more small pastries and open a bakery.

After retiring from service, Nancy decided to start a small business installing glass tinting on homes. For years, she managed the business, which generated enough profit to cover her family\u2019s living expenses and a bit more that she put away for retirement. After the recession hit, Nancy struggled to generate enough business to keep the doors open. She eventually lost every penny she saved and was forced into bankruptcy. Fortunately, Nancy was able to keep her home through re-financing and directing most of the household funds towards the mortgage. Nancy\u2019s dream is to be able to save money for retirement so that she will not be a burden to her children in later years. Although Nancy has recovered well after a major setback, she still needs some help. While the business has begun to generate profit once again, it does not generate much more than what is needed to cover basic living expenses; therefore, she does not have enough funds to cover some much needed repairs for her home. With the summer months fast approaching, her major concern is a non-functioning air conditioner.

After completing 12th grade, he started to do agriculture with his father. He grows groundnuts, onions and cotton. Earlier he used to cultivate hybrid cotton. When he realized how hazardous this hybrid cotton was to the environment and to the cattle, he stopped cultivating hybrid cotton and started cultivating indigenous varieties of cotton in 2011. After harvesting, he faced marketing problems and unfortunately he was forced to sell it to the local dealer who procures hybrid cotton. Later Ishwar formed a group in his village named \u201cDesi Cotton Growers Association\u201d with the farmers who were interested in cultivating indigenous varieties of cotton and the members of this group cultivated only indigenous varieties of cotton.

With the help of this loan, she can purchase the clothes easily to fulfill her business needs so that she can earn more profitable income to support her family and business.\r\n\r\nFor this financial assistance Parveen is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":163.66,"image":{"id":1879448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy more clothes for her clothing business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2015-05-13T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-12T19:30:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Parveen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2535},{"due_date":"2015-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2609},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2685},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2764},{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2845},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2928},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3013},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3101},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3192},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3285},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3381},{"due_date":"2016-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2662}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.85},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.92},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.85},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.81},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.35,"local_amount":2535,"processed_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T12:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2579.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665396686},{"amount":26.09,"local_amount":2609,"processed_date":"2015-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2654.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681299132},{"amount":26.85,"local_amount":2685,"processed_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-24T12:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2732.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":698259706},{"amount":27.64,"local_amount":2764,"processed_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2812.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711418396},{"amount":28.45,"local_amount":2845,"processed_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:20:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2894.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731222598},{"amount":29.28,"local_amount":2928,"processed_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-20T13:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2979.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":753601921}],"funded_date":"2015-05-20T12:32:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":883845,"name":"Muhtabar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muhtabar is 61 years old.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase two UV water treatment systems with 750 and 1,000 liter tanks, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nSt. Mary's Kyamuhanga Schools will repay their loan from school fees, which they collect each term. Felix ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1879517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

She carries out her business in the zone \u201cSur,\u201d that is characterized by the origins of its inhabitants: Aymaran, Quechuan, and Guaran\u00ed.  Migrants from every part of the country appropriated the area and formed an ever-growing economy.  It has a warm, subtropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 21 and 35 degrees Celsius [70 and 95 degrees Farenheit.]\r\n\r\nMaria has dark skin, brown eyes, brown hair, which she ties back, a short stature and a thin body type.  Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family, while she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and for her business.  She is in the center, wearing a black shirt and black leggings.  She enjoys her life in the company of her children who are in school studying.  They live in their own house made of brick and cement that has drinking water, electricity and a sewage system.\r\n\r\nThe need to improve her business led her to form a bank of people with businesses such as: a tire shop, natural medicine sales, a bakery, secondhand clothing sales, empanada sales, a bookshop, and television repairs, in order to request a loan and improve their professions.  Her business is women\u2019s intimate apparel sales, such as: push up, sports and plus size bras, a variety of underwear, garters, lingerie sets including body suits and corsets, and a variety of other lingerie including shaping, sexy, maternity, etc.\r\n\r\nShe carries out this profession by moving about markets every day of the week during the daytime.  She comments, \u201cMy basic needs are the lack of capital to invest in my business, and I am thinking of opening another market stall.\u201d  The advantage of her business is that her garments are sold constantly, and the disadvantage is the lack of capital to be able to invest and grow her business.  Her dream is to open her own women\u2019s lingerie store.  She wants to invest in her business through the purchase of women\u2019s intimate apparel in bulk.  This is her first sequence of loans with this institution in the six years that she has made a living in this profession.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Maria is requesting a loan to purchase

It is the first deep-water port in Ecuador and South America.\r\n\r\nTen women and two men from this city decided to get together and form a communal bank called \u201cLos Radicales\u201d. They make a living from different kinds of work. With the help of the loans, they hope to improve their businesses and their quality of life.\r\n\r\nOne of the members from this group is Yulexi. She is 23 years old and is in a common-law marriage. From this relationship, she has two children, aged nine and one. The eldest is at school. Her husband is a master builder.\r\n\r\nYulexi is a housewife who earns some money by selling Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and accessories for women). She sells the products door to door. She goes out every morning to do her rounds, making the most of the fact that her daughter is at school and she only has to take her one-year-old son with her. Sometimes her mother looks after the baby and it is easier for Yulexi to do her work. She sells her products on credit and she collects the money every eight days. She has been doing this work for nearly three years and it is going very well for her. She mostly sells perfumes and cosmetics.\r\n\r\nThis loan is for buying perfumes, creams, costume jewellery, and cosmetics. This is her first loan cycle in the communal bank and she hopes to keep receiving the loans for many years to come. Her dream is to keep getting ahead in her business and to give the best to her family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6150,"image":{"id":1873967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy perfumes, creams, costume jewellery, and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2015-05-14T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-13T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":6150,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yulexi Tatiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cinthia Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanessa Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana Maricela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery Zoraida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ram\u00f3n Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Narcisa Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sulema Bertilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramona Katherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirian Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santiago Arsecio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6128.05,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":766.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":766.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":766.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":766.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":766.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":766.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":766.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":765.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":768.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":768.76},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":768.76},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":768.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":768.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":768.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":768.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":768.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1537.52,"local_amount":1532.02,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1537.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665050888},{"amount":1537.51,"local_amount":1532.02,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1537.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681348677},{"amount":2306.25,"local_amount":2298.03,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:54:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2306.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696558995},{"amount":768.72,"local_amount":765.98,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":768.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711473853}],"funded_date":"2015-05-14T13:58:52Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T14:43:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eloise Minogue","image":null}},{"id":884038,"name":"Martha Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martha Elizabeth is 27 years old, is married and has three sons and they all live in her in-laws house.

Because Anto were unable to attend at photo-taking process, he were represented by his wife, which have agreed to be displayed on Kiva. They are standing in front of a cow house. Ono has a family with three children. All of them live in a small village in Karanganyar, Indonesia.\n\nOno has been running a small-scale vegetable farming and have a few cows to be fattened to resale. His business is going well. Recently, he also works as a bio-digester mason for Household Biogas (BIRU) program. However, he was deeply concerned to see the cow dung was wasted without further processing in the area around his residence, and it also polluted the surrounding neighborhood with a pungent odor.\n\nAfter advised by Yayasan Rumah Energi and LKM \u201cRukun Makmur\u201d (a local NGO \u2013 biogas construction partner of YRE) to install bio-digester, Ono realized that biogas is a good solution of his problem. He saw opportunity to reduce his dependence on non- renewable cooking gas. In addition, he knows that bio-slurry (biogas residue) is a good organic fertilizer for his plants. Ono invited six of his friends above to form a farmer group. He is keen to purchase a bio-digester, but he does not have sufficient capital for it. A loan from Kiva will help him and other farmer group members to make it possible.\n\nHe have an optimism that if he can build bio-digester, he can use the bio-gas for cooking, and bio-slurry (biogas residue) as fertilizer for his plantation, which can increase his family revenue. He hopes that in the future, he can invite the whole farmers in his village to use biogas.

People like his arts and appreciate for his efforts. \r\n\r\nHe wants to cope with the demand for bridal dresses, and for this, he is seeking a loan to buy stock of threads, fancy cloths, sequins, and pearls of various colors.\r\n\r\nShumila requires capital to buy the desired inventory for her husband, but she does not have sufficient cash in hand. So she has humbly requested a loan  from BRAC Pakistan. Through this loan, her husband would be able to buy the inventory he needs. Shumila is very thankful to BRAC Pakistan.
