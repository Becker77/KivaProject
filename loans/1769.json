He is 46 years old. He is married and has three children. He has a very harmonious family. They live in the countryside. \r\n\r\nIn order to have income in the family, all members of the family try to earn money somehow. Everyone works as much as they can. Furqat's main and stable business is animal husbandry. He rears and sells cattle. His wife helps him with this business. She tends to the cattle and also sells their milk. \r\n\r\nThe animal husbandry business brings Furqat a good and stable income. Thus, he wishes to expand this business. He needs to buy a few more heads of cattle for cultivating and subsequent selling. For this, Furqat has turned to Arvand and wants to receive a loan in order to buy cattle. He hopes that this business will successfully expand and bring in more profits, so that he can sufficiently meet the needs of his family. Furqat thanks Arvand in advance for the support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1866233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

He would like to invest in a purchase of raw materials, including wood, beads, paint, and sandpaper.\r\n\r\nAbdulai has been selling through NOVICA since 2013. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"It took a painful experience for me to get into art. I had to drop out of school after my dad passed on. My mum, who was not working at that moment, was faced with the challenge of taking care of us. I told myself I would find a job to help keep my younger siblings in school. And I did. I worked as an errand boy for art workshops in our neighborhood and used the tips I got for running errands to buy food for my brothers and sisters. I was fascinated by the way the workers could carve beautiful designs out of wood. I was willing to learn a trade to be able to earn money and thus achieve my goal of helping my family. So when I was given the opportunity to try my hands with some pieces of wood, I was happy and knew this was going to be the beginning of a bright future. This was how I began.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to work on creating more pieces. Your assistance will go a long way to make me achieve this objective.

It rarely rains during the winter and in the summer the temperature varies between 10-19 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nNoemi has a dark complexion, brown eyes, and long black hair loosely worn. She is short with a medium physique. Her mother tongue is Quechua which she speaks at home and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and for business purposes. She enjoys her life with her partner who works as a builder and with her son who studies at school. They live in their own home which consists of two rooms built of brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof. It has electricity and well water drawn by an electric pump. They do not have a sewer system nor glass in the windows and there is no water in the kitchen, bathroom or laundry room. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling zumos and juices. The most popular zumos are carrot. Bicervecinas are also consumed a lot which is a mixture of dark beer with egg and sugar mixed in the blender. It is very popular because it is restorative. \u201cJuices and zumos are consumed frequently because a large part of the area does not have drinking water,\u201d she comments. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she continually has customers. The disadvantage is the lack of drinking water for everyday life. Her dream is to install drinking water in her house so her family will live under better conditions. She wants to get a water connection in her kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room so they can stop drinking the dirty well water.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan cycle with the institution in the twelve years she has been in business. It is for these reasons that Noemi is asking for a loan to install drinking water in her kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room so they can stop drinking dirty well water in order to improve their health."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1874828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She lives with her husband, who is a private artisan and earns approximately 600 GEL. He is the only breadwinner in the family. \r\n\r\nRaisa has a great desire to start her own business and add to the family's welfare. In the region there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make a living. She decided to start a clothing-trading business with a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers.

She is married and has 2 children. She comes to Arvand for the first time after learning that there was an opportunity to obtain financial support. Gulbahor lives with her family in a rural area. She does not have a college education because she could not attend a university due to financial hardships in her family. She works as a waitress at a cafe. Her husband also does not have a college education. He is a shepherd.\r\n\r\nTo provide a livable income, Gulbahor's family is involved in their own business.

Masozi School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. \r\n\r\nThe school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nMasozi School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Florence ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":410,"image":{"id":1880541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Wakiso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-05-14T21:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-13T21:00:07Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.42,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Masozi School","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3035000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":203.38,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-24T12:11:55Z","rounded_local_amount":612920.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.62,"payment_id":681370949},{"amount":201.2,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":612920.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.8,"payment_id":755507198}],"funded_date":"2015-05-15T04:38:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":884653,"name":"Zeinab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zeinab is a 39 year old married woman.

Because the arable land is big, Laura and her husband can not manage to cultivate it and the support is vital for them.<br \/><br \/>As this is Laura's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The First-Chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before because they have no credit history. Through this joint initiative, almost 500 borrowers like Laura get a chance to have their first loans and develop their businesses. Laura hopes for the lenders' support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1880571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for tomato seeds, fertilizer, pesticides for cultivation and to hire workers for harvesting work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Bambakashat village of Armavir region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2015-05-15T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-14T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":51.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":59.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":60.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":60.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":60.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":62.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":63.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":64.51},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":65.2},{"due_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66.93},{"due_date":"2016-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":67.01},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":67.75},{"due_date":"2016-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":68.76},{"due_date":"2016-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2016-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":70.64},{"due_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2016-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":71.42},{"due_date":"2017-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":72.63},{"due_date":"2017-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":73.17},{"due_date":"2017-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":74.22},{"due_date":"2017-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":74.8},{"due_date":"2017-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":75.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.91},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.02},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.51},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.2},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.93},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.01},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.75},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.76},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.64},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.42},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.63},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.17},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.22},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.8},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":881666,"name":"Joel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Joel, vive junto a sus padres en el Distrito de Ate Vitarte, ubicado en la carretera central de Lima. \nActualmente se encuentra cursando el tercer semestre de Mecatr\u00f3nica Industrial, carrera que le gust\u00f3 siempre desde muy peque\u00f1o.Le va muy bien en sus estudios, salvo por la falta de dinero que pone en riesgo la continuidad de su carrera.

Currently, he is in his third semester of Industrial Mechatronics, the career he has been interested in since he was very small.  He is doing very well in his studies, except that he lacks the necessary funds, which puts him at risk of not being able to continue with his program.  He has 20 hours a week of theory classes and 20 hours a week of practical classes.  Joel feels that this career will give him great personal satisfaction and thanks to this, his parents won't have to work because he could take care of his family.  He always enjoys working with anything related to electronics.  He will use the KIVA loan to resolve his education expenses and continue studying.  He still has another year and a half until he can complete his degree.  His dream is to have a stable job, to continue developing professionally, and to see that his parents feel proud of him.  The main obstacle for him occured when he felt that he couldn't continue on because of the difficult financial situation in his family.  He feels very relieved by the support being offered, and also happy to know that there are people like him who can get ahead thanks to the opportunity offered through obtaining this loan.  Finally, Joel would like to say to KIVA: \"This is a great help that you are offering me and thanks to this, I can continue studying without any obstacles, and become a professional in Industrial Mechatronics.

Installing two water filtration systems will therefore save the school money in the long term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

This is Dauda. He is the Head teacher of Wagwa Memorial Primary School, a mixed school in the Urban area of Lukaya in Masaka with 410 students. Wagwa School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nWagwa School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Dauda ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":410,"image":{"id":1880635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

Her business is located in the Bajo Chuquiaguillo zone located to the north of the city. It lacks drinking water, despite the fact that in its area, there is the Incachaca reservoir, which provides the liquid to a large part of the metropolis. It has a dry and cold climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 0-12 degrees centigrade. \r\n\r\nAna has dark skin, dark eyes, long black hair she keeps braided, is short, has a robust physique, dresses traditionally (hat, shawl, and pollera [traditional Andean skirt]), her native language is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for the work she does. She shares her life with her daughter who is independent. They live in their own room built of brick and cement with a roof of metal sheeting which has drinking water, electricity and sewer services. Her business is selling basic products and food such as water, bread, sugar, flour, noodles, rice, coffee, soft drinks, paper, sweets., etc. She does this work in her neighborhood store which is located in the lower part of her house. \"I began my business due to the ease of selling in my own home...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that it is known by the neighbors. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to invest in the purchase of merchandise. Her dream is to save up, invest in her business, and improve her quality of life. She wants to strengthen her business through the purchase of merchandise in bulk, such as sugar, noodles, rice, canned goods, etc. to stock her business and meet the needs of her customers.

Djeneba grows peanuts and rice and does truck farming on her land but must also face the challenges of farmers, such as lack of rain and farming materials. Djeneba is kicking off her first year with myAgro, and signed up in order to increase her yield with myAgro\u2019s proposed services. This year, Djeneba is making payments to buy a myAgro packet of OPV seed and fertilizer to farm peanuts in order to augment her yield on her .0625 hectare of land. Djeneba has been cultivating peanuts for 20 years for its food-producing value, explaining that peanuts are directly consumable by the family and is used as a base sauce in food.
