However, increasing price of feeds makes it difficult for her to breed and farm more pigs.  Therefore she decided to apply for a loan from DINARI to purchase feeds and more piglets.  With the help of 6 month loan, Komang earned additional $110 profit.  \r\n\r\nAfter that result, Komang decided to apply for second loan from DINARI.

She began her business by selling traditional napkins in the market in San Juan Sacatep\u00e9quez. Over time the demand from her customers grew larger and she saw the need for more capital in order to buy spools of thread. <P>\r\n\r\nToday she not only makes napkins, but also cloths used to carry babies, tablecloths, and scarves. Isabel feels the effects of the economic situation, but is happy that her customers continue to place orders. She says that the cost of thread has risen and that she needs more capital to purchase the necessary materials for her work. <P>\r\n\r\n For this reason she is requesting a loan to be able to meet customer demand and to continue making sales and growing her business. Her dream is to have a big store in the market that sells all different types of weavings. She will continue struggling and pushing forward to provide for her family just as she has always done.<P>\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Bouch, Kiva Fellow<b\/><P>\r\n\r\nPara Do\u00f1a Isabel la elaboraci\u00f3n de tejidos a la que se dedica ha sido el regalo de su madre ya que fue ella quien le ense\u00f1\u00f3 este oficio.

Through primary and secondary school and up through advanced studies to the present, he has acquired a solid experience in earning a living. Kalobwe's first business was selling lamp kerosene, a business he began in 1978 with a starting capital of US$ 1 when he was still in second grade. From 1978 to 1988, Kalobwe worked hard and practiced good management which allowed him to accumulate profit that he used to diversify his business, adding the sale of charcoal and smoked fish. <P>\r\n\r\nIn 1988 he had a total capital of US$ 200. After having received his official high school diploma in 1988, Kalobwe went to Kinshasa to register for higher studies. From 1989 up to the present, he got into another type of business selling larval caterpillars (as food), which are much in demand  in Kinshasa. His beginning capital for the new business in 1989 was US$ 150.  <P>\r\n\r\nOver the years and using the profit he accumulated, he managed to begin selling other products as well, for example peanuts and purified water. Presently, Kalobwe has a capital of about US$ 1000 and his business is generating a profit of US$ 300 per month. <P>\r\n\r\nWorking with HOPE since July 2008, Kalobwe wants to make his dream come true: opening a little factory making purified water. His business is situated in the north-west district of the city of Kinshasa. He is 43, married and the father of 8 children from 1 year old to 20 years of age. Six of his children are enrolled in school. Kalobwe and his family love their businesses because they provide them with the financial means to solve household problems. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":314644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of bags to pack purified water in for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 29 years old, and a single mother of 2 children aged 6 months and 10.  She attended school through the tenth grade but dropped out due to respiratory problems.  She lives in her own home with her children.  She also supports her mother, who still lives in her native province of Zambezia, by sending money to her at the end of every month.  \r\n\r\nAurea did not grow up with her parents.  When she was still a baby she went to live in the Inhambane province with friends, and later lived in the city of Maputo (in a home left to her).  She does not live with the father of her children.  She lives off the rent she earns from a building that was left to her by her grandfather in the city of Maputo, which she rents out, earning 12.000,00MT monthly.  She is using the money to build a brick home in phases, and to cover family expenses.   \r\n\r\nShe learned to run a business (selling a variety of products) in the city of Maputo, before moving to Boane where she has lived for more than 10 years. \r\n\r\nThis is Aurea's first loan with Hluvuku-Adsema, in the amount of 12.000,00MT.  It will be used to purchase construction materials (cement, sand, etc.) with the goal of completing construction on her home.  Her future plans are to finish her home and build a small store.  To do this she plans to repay the loan without any problems so that she can have access to future loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":393739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchae of construction materials (cement, sand, etc.) ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-27T19:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.58,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aurea Alexandre","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":545.03},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":567.43},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":590.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":615.02},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":640.3},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.61},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":694.01},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":722.53},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":752.22},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":783.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":815.32},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":848.82},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":883.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":920.02},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":957.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":997.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.28},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.06},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.01},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.03},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.57},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.14},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":42.69,"local_amount":1138.36,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:28:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1157.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971847},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":1083.39,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1102.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816785},{"amount":41.68,"local_amount":1111.54,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1130.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708968},{"amount":86.25,"local_amount":2299.96,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2339.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938017},{"amount":47.43,"local_amount":1264.75,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1286.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938018},{"amount":46.35,"local_amount":1290.09,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1312.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.03,"payment_id":136698570},{"amount":95.88,"local_amount":2729.68,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2776.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.48,"payment_id":151915995},{"amount":35.51,"local_amount":1082.23,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1100.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.07,"payment_id":159878446}],"funded_date":"2009-09-27T22:04:02Z","paid_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":143478,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martha is thirty-five years old.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Inosia has 5 years of experience in this business.  Inosia needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 tala or US $63 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Inosia joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Inosia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Inosia P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Married to Rafael G., a vegetable vendor, she is blessed with three children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life. Both of them have been selling vegetables for five years.\n\nAnita has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends the weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently.\n\nBecause of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, Anita was able to borrow four times in CCT\u2019s cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy more vegetables from suppliers. Her business lets her earn a profit of PHP 6,000 per month.\n\nNow, with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business and used to buy assorted vegetables for her vegetable store.\n\nAnita dreams that her business will grow so that they can buy a delivery truck for their produce and prays that God will bless their lives as one family.\n\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":479255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in her own house, along with her husband and 4 children. Her business is the sale of bedspreads, sheets, curtains, and electrical home appliances. Whenever her customers ask her for particular products, Diola goes to the wholesale market in the capital to get the products they requested. Sometimes her husband helps her with the purchases so that they can stock greater quantities of products to avoid disappointments when she offers them to her customers. She feels happy with the work that she carries out. So far she has had many customers, and she likes this very much because she knows that this way her earnings will increase. Now her big dream is to set up a shop, and she will try to prepare her house for this, since this way she will not have to neglect her children. This is her eighteenth loan with MFP, and she has promised again to be responsible in making her payments, since she finds this credit so helpful in the progress of her business. With the loan that she is applying for, she will invest in the purchase of a sewing machine to help her daughter who is studying sewing and tailoring."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":607109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"Buy a sewing machine to help her daughter who is studying sewing and tailoring.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T21:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":104.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":109.24},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":113.42},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":119.26},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":123.85},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":129.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.92},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.65},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.99,"local_amount":213.78,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":234.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449981},{"amount":44.55,"local_amount":113.42,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":124.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588680},{"amount":46.86,"local_amount":119.26,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":131.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725182},{"amount":48.65,"local_amount":123.85,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":136.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463274},{"amount":50.95,"local_amount":129.69,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":142.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886679}],"funded_date":"2010-10-04T23:55:18Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":238496,"name":"Rosal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosal B. is from the village of Calamagui.

More than four years ago, she decided to establish her own source of income. She previously worked in a store that sold spare parts for cars, so thanks to the experience she gained there, she decided to open her own spare auto parts store, where she specializes in clutches. Since then, she has been selling spare auto parts from a storefront located in a commercial zone. She has converted part of the space into her home, so she can always take care of her business.\r\n\r\nHer business is currently going very well. She also sells accessories for cars, which has increased her earnings. As a result, she has been able to contract the services of a mechanic who helps install the parts in her customers' cars when needed. Evelyn's greatest dream is to have a well-equipped auto workshop and a much larger space, because she has seen that her business is profitable. She will keep working to achieve this goal.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.

She sells the coffee in the city of La Merced.\r\nRita and Werner have thought to increase their fields and improve their production.

She plans to invest this loan in rearing pigs and farming yellow yams and sweet yams.  She plans  to use her own savings to rent the land for farming her yams; she will use this loan to purchase all the necessary farming supplies for yams and to begin her pig business. <P>\r\n \r\nThis is Pamela's third loan from GHAPE.  She has never invested in pigs before; however, her husband has experience in this area and has passed his knowledge on to her.  She feels she can have large profits in this business because of her husband's support.  There is a high demand for yams, both sweet and yellow, in this region of Cameroon; she hopes her yams will fill some of this demand.  She also plans to sell some of the manure from her pigs to people in her community.  <P>\r\n \r\nWith the profits from this loan, Pamela hopes to build a proper pit latrine for her family.  She also hopes to save some money to purchase her own home; her family is currently living with her brother-in-law.  She lost her home due to her brother's debt.  She recently remarried after divorcing her first husband; many of those in her family have disowned her for this act.  She hopes this loan provides her with enough profit to begin to improve her family's living standards and recoup her losses.  <P>\r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":224101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"raising piglets and buying yellow yam and sweet yam seeds to grow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

They decided to move the factory to expand it.  Because of this, the workers also moved and so Cristina lost her principal clients.\r\n\r\nSome time later, she also decided to move away from home.  With this move, she saw a source of income if she dedicated herself to the sale of vegetables in the town market.  Because of this, she bought her place four years ago and sells everyday.  A year after beginning this business she thought it would be good if she also took advantage of her time in the afternoon since sometimes the vegetable business is not sufficient. Every afternoon she sells kebabs, grilled chicken, among other dishes, in the principal area near her house.\r\n\r\nShe has been a single mother of 3 kids that are now 20, 18 and 16 years old.

K. is a 42-year-old woman, who is married and has two children. For the past ten years, she and her husband Bahodur Azimov have raised and traded in cattle. Her husband purchases young steers at the cattle market for a low price. Gulnora fattens them for three or four months at home and in the pasture, and then sells them to the butchers for a good price.  This is her way of contributing to the family finances. In addition, her husband earns a living as a taxi driver. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":324212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T03:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:23:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1027.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87085023},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1027.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001245}],"funded_date":"2009-06-01T07:03:28Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:35:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":114743,"name":"Mazakhir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mazakhir K. runs a small grocery store, selling a wide variety of foodstuffs, including canned foods, soft drinks, juices, sweets, tea, coffee, etc. He has been in this business for about twelve years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married with 8 adult children. He has been farming for 20 years in Kisii town in Western Kenya. Simion's products are tea, milk and trees, which he sells to Kenya Tea Development Authority and the local market.\r\n\r\nSimion recently completed his previous loan from Juhudi Kilimo.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rachel has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rachel joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rachel is requesting a loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rachel from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She comes from a family of farmers and as a young person tried in many ways to advance herself and to reach for a better life. After graduating from the high school in her region, she entered the university in the nearby city of Cahul, but having had limited financial support from her parents she was unable to finish her studies. \r\n<p>\r\nShe began working as a sales person at the outdoor market as an employee of a business owner. The income which she was receiving was very small and was enough only to meet the most basic needs.

He is married and the father of two children: the first is a 5-year-old daughter who goes to school, and the second is a 1-year-old son.  Belmiro moved with his aunt to Namaacha, a village on the border of Swaziland, to avoid the frequent illnesses to which he had been subject in the Gaza area.  <P>\r\n\r\nBelmiro arrived in Namaacha and was unable to get a spot in school to continue his studies.  The next year, his aunt gave him money to enable him to start his own business.  He began by selling cakes he bought in Swaziland and reselling them next to a soft drink stand at the border.  His business benefited when customs agents decided to shut down the soft drink stand; consequently he started selling soft drinks in addition to cakes and started exchanging currency.  Through this, Belmiro was able to build his own house.  Years later he got together with his wife and left his aunt\u2019s house.  <P>\r\n\r\nLittle by little he built his own shop in his house to augment the family\u2019s income.  His biggest products are wheat flour, which he buys at 20 meticais (MTn) and resells for 28MTn per kilogram; rice, buying at 500MTn and reselling for 625MTn per sack; fish, buying at 350MTn and reselling for 700MTn per plate; and pasta, buying at 200MTn and reselling for 350MTn per box.  He works from 7am to 8pm and earns 6,000MTn monthly.  He is able to save 2,000MTn per month.  In addition to his children, Belmiro takes care of his parents in Gaza, sending them 1,000MTn for basic goods each month.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Belmiro\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku [Kiva\u2019s Field Partner] and his first with Kiva.  He used the first loan, of 15,000MTn, to strengthen his cakes and drinks business and repaid the loan on time.  He is asking for this second loan, of 12,000MTn, to buy merchandise for his shop.  His goal is to grow his shop and request a new loan to purchase a vehicle to facilitate his day-to-day business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

His wife, Mrs. Khum Lay, works in a garment factory and contributes a small salary to the support of the family. Although they work hard, they still cannot support the family well. In order to improve their living conditions, Mr. C. B. decided to ask for a loan to buy a cow to start a breeding business. Mr. C.

They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Mamadali, 68 years old, is married with three children. Mamadali sells dried fruits in the central local market. He has been in this business for 11 years. \r\n<p>\r\nDried fruits are very popular in Tajikistan: any hostess will have dried fruits on hand for serving in case there are guests in the house. Moreover, dried fruits are served as a rule during all family occasions, such as wedding parties, birthday parties, and other events. \r\n<p>\r\nConsidering the constant demand for his goods, Mamadali's business is quite successful and brings in a stable income for the family. Now Mamadali wants to increase the stock of his goods in order to be able to supply all the demands of his buyers. For this purpose, he requests $800 for the term of 9 months. He is going to use the loan to purchase dried fruits, like raisins and apricots, as well as nuts, like almonds and pistachios, with the purpose of increasing his range of goods for sale. \r\n<p>\r\nMamadali has already demonstrated himself to be a dependable client with positive credit history. He would like to thank all for their support and promises to pay the loan in time.   \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Yourself. She did not have the opportunity to go to school due to poverty. She is involved with the sale of charcoal and has been doing this business for the last 21 years. Her business is located in Paynesville, on the outskirts of Monrovia. She started this business through the help of a family member. She is married with seven children whose ages range from 12-23 years old and are currently in school. She also helps to take care for two siblings.\r\n\r\nThe challenge she faces is that there are so many vendors selling charcoal in the market. Oretha plans to use her 5,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 25,000 Liberian dollar group loan to purchase more charcoal to improve the business. Her goal is to improve her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Oretha is holding the sign.\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country.  Founded in 1994, the non-profit organization has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship.  LEAP seeks to help rebuild post-conflict Liberia through its group and individual loans to micro- and small-scale entrepreneurs, and puts emphasis on lending to women.\r\n\r\nJoin the Team LEAP - Liberia lending team on Kiva today: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/community\/viewTeam?team_id=10019\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":524937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more charcoal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Red Light, Paynesville","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.5 -9.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":141,"posted_date":"2010-04-16T20:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oretha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Massa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LRD","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1032},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1840}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.48},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":23.63,"local_amount":1575,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1634.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136711597},{"amount":121.5,"local_amount":8100,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T07:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":8403.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144998148},{"amount":121.5,"local_amount":8100,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:43:27Z","rounded_local_amount":8403.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152755722},{"amount":108.37,"local_amount":7225,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":7495.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159667046}],"funded_date":"2010-04-17T00:25:22Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:33:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":197556,"name":"Cristo Vive 1,2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"R.MariaR.

As a child, he started working the land that he inherited from his parents. Currently, with the help of his family, he is able to cover all of his land with potato crops, thus achieving his goal of generating his own income. However, when it is harvest time he hires labourers to help with the harvesting of his products. He says that he enjoys working in the fields, as this is his only source of income; furthermore, this activity has made him independent, so he hopes to continue farming more intensively. This is his first loan with MFP. He is very happy to know that he has financial support, and he is grateful to be part of his community bank because all of the members are responsible and very supportive people.

She lives with her partner and their 4 children and grandchildren in her own home.  She has been raising and selling small animals such as chickens and guinea pigs for 10 years.  She raises the animals on her farm.  Every couple of weeks she sells them in her area's livestock market.  She also sells them to restaurants and some customers who come to her house to buy them.  She likes to raise animals and do this work since it allows her to be independent and improve her income.  In addition to this, she rents out rooms which also helps her financial situation.  For this reason, she would like to improve her house's infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan which she has had from MFP.  She is very happy to know that she has financial support.  She likes being a part of her community bank because all of its members are people who she knows.  They are all responsible and very supportive of each other.

business and a fish vending business.  She lives in Bantayan, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing and fish vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Maura is borrowing PHP 19,500 to purchase fishing gears and equipment. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Maura aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

In front of the store are wall-to-wall bars of welded rebar with a rebar door you can duck under. This is constructed so that when she leaves, she can \u201clock up\u201d.

She is able to earn an income of MZN 1,000 to 1,200 a day, and she saves money through the traditional savings system called Xitique. \r\n<p>\r\nShe had a loan of MZN 15,000 with the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Gu\u00ea-Gue-Gue for her business. Later on, she learned about Hluvuki through her neighbors and decided to get in contact. This is her 5th loan with this institution, of MZN 15,000. With the loan, she intends to buy merchandise (sodas, wines, whisky and others) in order to improve her stock. The previous loans were of MZN 6,500; MZN 10,000; MZN 15,000; and MZN 15,000, for her business and for housing.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, she intends to request new loans to develop even more her business, as well as to finish her house construction.\r\n<p>\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Giovanna Fernandes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":433160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy and selling of sodas, beverages and others ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-11-25T18:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laurinda Joao","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":659.14},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":688.93},{"due_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":720.08},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":752.63},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":786.65},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":822.21},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":859.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":898.23},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":938.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":981.28},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1025.64},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1072},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1120.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1171.11},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1224.05},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1279.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.07},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.53},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.08},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.86},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.9},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.21},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.99},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.84},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":82.06,"local_amount":2344.52,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2403.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709081},{"amount":84.46,"local_amount":2413.19,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2473.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938207},{"amount":88.25,"local_amount":2521.29,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2584.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938208},{"amount":93.47,"local_amount":2674.52,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2741.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.14,"payment_id":128972066},{"amount":95.42,"local_amount":2726.25,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2794.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698644},{"amount":81.2,"local_amount":2320.23,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2378.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916094}],"funded_date":"2009-11-26T02:01:06Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Giovanna Fernandes","image":333473}},{"id":160068,"name":"Mirla Manuela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mirla es una mujer din\u00e1mica  y entusiasta, vive en el distrito de Yarina Cocha, regi\u00f3n de Ucayali- Per\u00f9.

He has a retail shop where he sells spare parts for foreign cars. He has been involved in this business for more than four years. He provides the cars with spare parts and his family with food and other needs. Gafurjon has a great demand for his spare parts, thus he wants to buy more goods in order to be in requisition of his clients.

Gafurjon is happy about this loan and would like to thank everyone for the trust and support.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Elvira\u2019s sister (mother of her nieces) is a housewife and is dependent on her husband\u2019s small income as a hired laborer. Aside from supporting the needs of her parents, Elvira also wanted to help  support her sister and her nieces. \r\nA way Elvira realized to have a source of income to support her dream of improving her family\u2019s standard of living is by having her own business. With that vision, she joined ASHI in 2004 and has put up a small variety store which sells groceries, foodstuffs and beverages. Eventually, as the amount of loan she is qualified to request from ASHI increased because of maintaining an excellent credit rating (business rating, attendance to center meetings, and repayment rating) inventories of her store increased as well as her profit. Looking back on their lives before she had her own business, now it\u2019s quite different, and financially life has improved. \r\nWith the loan Elvira  is currently requesting, she hopes to enhance her other business which is hog fattening. After four months of fattening her hogs, they will be sold either alive or slaughtered directly to people in their village and\/or in the market. Proceeds from this business would augment the proceeds of her store and therefore, Elvira will be able to raise her family out of poverty.

Zaituni is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kalisizo in the Masaka area of Uganda.  She is married and has 2 children.  One of her children is in school, and she takes care of another child who is also in school.  Zaituni has a business selling fish in Kalisizo.  Zaituni\u2019s business serves the local community in Kalisizo by providing fresh fish to the other people in the village.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Zaituni is requesting a loan of 100,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used for purchasing more fish to sell and also a basket to transport her fish to market.  Zaituni hopes to sell more fish in the future and generate profit in order to provide for her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: \r\n\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  \r\n\r\nThese loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50,"image":{"id":558657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She sold items made of plastic including tubs, buckets, strainers and ladles.  Now she cooks in the mornings and sells the food to her neighbors.  Also, in the afternoons she sells items like costume jewelry and hair barrettes in the streets, in addition to making porridge.  <p>\r\nRossy is a member of the \u201cJerid \u2013 Camino al Exito\u201d Communal Bank where she obtained her first loan.  With that money she traveled to the city of Trujillo to buy undergarments at the wholesale market.  With this loan of $450, which she plans to repay in six months, she will buy all of the provisions necessary to prepare different stews.  She will also invest in the construction of her house where she will create space to install a kiosk from which to sell her products.  Her greatest dream is to open a restaurant in the center of Puerto Salaverry. <p><b>Translated from Spanish by Hugh Yarbrough, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Rossy Paola P.

","en":"Rene Hilario Mondragon Ramirez is 49 years old, married, has one son who is seven years old, and attended school through the fifth grade.  His life partner works as a pharmacy sales clerk. His plans are to continue working to support his family and pay the loan from Foundation Leon 2000. He hopes to get another transport vehicle because the one he now has is not in very good condition, but because of the difficult economic condition the country finds itself in it is very difficult to replace the vehicle, since with what he earns he needs to maintain his home. His dreams are that his son is able to prepare himself sufficiently so that he can have a good future. Also, he wants his son to study since he did not have the opportunity to study and he does not want his son to face this type of situation, which is why he works so hard, so that his son has the possibility to be prepared for studying. \r\n\r\nHis work is to provide taxi service, moving around. He has had this business for two years. Don Rene started this business as a truck driver and saved what he was paid since he was planning to buy a car and use it to provide taxi service. This would be the type of work that he would use to maintain his family but due to the situation he could not get all the money together, but later his sister took it upon herself to help him so that Don Rene was able to buy his vehicle and that's how he got his taxi. His experiences with his clients, providing this service, have pleased him a lot, since he likes to serve the public. And his family has helped him as necessary since it is dignified and humble work, plus it is through this means that he assures that his family obtains what is necessary.

Firuza is 34 years old. She is married with 4 children. Firuza is a devoted mother who struggles day after day to provide the best for her family. Five years ago she got an idea to start raising sheep to contribute to the family finances, taking advantage of the space she had available in her house for this business. Her elder daughter (pictured) helps her with the business. Slowly the number of sheep increased and with them, her clients started asking for more and more. With an endless list of requests she has finally decided to increase the number of her animals she keeps and for this reason she is requesting a loan of $ 600 USD for the term of 9 months. Be an important part of the growth of Firuza\u2019s business.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She lives in a rented room next to her only child, Yudith, who is 16 years old and the motivation behind all of her efforts. She has a restaurant in the city of Puno that offers an eclectic menu of delicious food which leaves her customers happy and praising the prowess of the cook. Juana hopes to have a restaurant with a better environment where her patrons can feel more comfortable. What she most likes about her business is cooking and seeing how her customers enjoy the food that she prepares. In the three years that she has spent in this business, she has learned to work under pressure, and that is exactly the most difficult part of the job, since she always tries to satisfy all of her customers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Most of the members have businesses.  Others have the dream of starting a new one like selling cosmetics and jewelry, buying and selling vehicles, public transportation service, beauty salon, and selling food.  Others are employed by different businesses.  The competition is high, especially in food sales and the sale of cosmetics.  Each day every member hopes for a good result in their sales.  There is much competition, and the members could stay in a stand or in one place waiting for the customers to come to them.  To the contrary, the members travel to sell their things in order to be able to have good sales during the day.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to make their businesses grow with the increase of merchandise at a low cost. It is also to get tools and supplies to increase income.  This is to give their children a better education and a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nMost of the members had only heard of group loans.  In the training that they were given about loans they were informed about the movement.  They learned what this institution wants for the members.

Since she has her own family and children to raise, she strives to have her own business and earn her own income to be able to provide for the needs of her family and to bring happiness and harmony into their home. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNorita believes that as a mother and a wife, she should have her own way of earning money and not depend on her husband\u2019s income. During her first venture in a business and all throughout the years of maintaining it since 2005, ASHI has been her great source of financial capital. Despite the struggles she faces both in matters of the business and her family, through credit from ASHI somehow her worries were always eased. Now, she is proposing a loan of Php 30,000 as her seventh loan in ASHI to pay for variety of specialty foods like coconut jam, banana chips, peanut butter, barquillos (wafers), turones (banana fritters), custard pie, pinipig (immature rice), lingua de gata (cat's tongue cookies) and other supplies.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently in Norita\u2019s growing business, she would like to request a much larger loan amount to supplement her working capital. Someday she wishes her food retail business will grow large enough to have the capacity to sell wholesale. But in the meantime, the proceeds she makes from her business are saved in preparation for the expense of educating her four children. She hopes that until their graduation from college, she will be able to give her support financially.

It takes 10 minutes to reach Picoaza from the capital city of Manabi, which is separated by a bridge spanning the Portoviejo River.  Picoaza is one of the sectors experiencing greatest commercial growth, with visits by its own residents and outsiders to purchase items.  Here one can buy wholesale.  The area is known for its toy fair at Christmas, offering the best prices on the market.\r\n\r\nIn this lovely parish, we spoke with Maryuri, 42 years of age, who for 37 cycles now has been a part of the Women in Struggle Communal Bank.  She is an outstanding professional in hand embroidery.\r\nThree years ago she graduated in dressmaking, and she works in the craft of hand embroidery.  Maryuri graduated from high school in the parish where she lives.  She very much enjoys her work, and she has continued the work, sharing half of her time with household duties.  She is married and has three young children.\r\n\r\nMaryuri\u2019s work consists of buying material such as terry cloth, threads, sponges, stones, beads, and other accessories to complete the item she is making.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Maryuri will buy all the material she needs, for she has several orders pending delivery, such as covers for blenders and steam tables.

Con el producto de sus ahorros compr\u00f3 un peque\u00f1o molino manual, tiempo despu\u00e9s adquiri\u00f3 un molino el\u00e9ctrico y otras m\u00e1quinas para preparar la masa de ma\u00edz y la masa de harina de trigo.

Heliana Santamar\u00eda C. is an enterprising woman and a single mother of two youngsters, ages 11 and 15.  She runs a small business out of her home where she makes finger foods, miniature turnovers, \u201cquibbes\u201d (fried pastries stuffed with meat), \u201ccariba\u00f1olas\u201d (another type of meat-filled pastry made with cassava dough), and corn <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arepa\" target=\"_blank\" >arepas<\/a>.  Her products are packaged in polystyrene containers.  Heliana learned this trade after having worked several years in a bakery.  She later became unemployed and felt it was time to start her own business so that she could support her children.  Using her savings she bought a small manual grain mill.  Afterwards, she was able to acquire an electric mill and other machines for preparing cornmeal and wheat flour.  From the beginning her products have been well-received.  At first, Heliana sold her products directly to customers by walking through the streets and going door-to-door.  She currently has two salespeople and a permanent employee who helps with production.  Each day, Sra. Heliana produces 100 trays that sell between 2500 and 3000 COP.  Her profit margin, after deducting expenses, is 20%.  With the year-end holidays approaching, her sales will increase considerably.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she plans to invest the funds in the following manner.  Part of the money will be used to buy supplies such as wheat flour, corn, cheese, yeast, meat, and other ingredients.  The other part will be used to acquire construction materials to renovate the shop where she operates her business.  Sra. Heliana is an optimistic and determined woman who is able to succeed in her business and with her children without the help of a husband.

She lives in her own home with her husband, Manuel, who is 47, and her beloved daughter Tracy, who is five. She wants to give them a better quality of life. Selling meat has given Gilda the necessary income to support her family. Her stand is in the N\u00b0 2 Market (and important market in the city of Pucallpa), which is very well visited since the meat that she sells is very fresh and flavorful. This has given her a good reputation and brings her many customers. The thing she most likes about her work is getting to know her customers over the meat that will give all their meals more flavor. She has been in this business for 20 years, and the thing she finds most difficult about it is having to stay at her stand all day without being able to leave. This is, however, part of the sacrifice necessary for making more money. She hopes that in time she will have a bigger butcher shop where she can serve more customers.

Lucy is fifty years old, and when her husband abandoned her, she searched for a way to make a living.  This is how, with much effort, she was able to acquire two sewing machines to start her small sewing shop to make rain ponchos.  She does this work very efficiently with the help of her two younger children.  This hardworking model mother works very hard from 7:00 in the morning until 8:00 at night in the company of her beloved family.  The wish of Lucy and her family is to have more fabric to make their waterproof ponchos and to distribute them on a wholesale basis to the different markets in the city.  During this rainy season, the markets are demanding a large number of these garments.  To secure their plans, Lucy is requesting a loan, which she will invest and use to obtain other economic benefits.

O. is forty-five years old. She is married and has four kids who are all still in the basic school. Gladys lives with her husband and family in a community called Nkwaateng. Nkwaateng is in the Eastern Region of Ghana. A sizeable number of the inhabitants are engaged in farming activities. However, quite an appreciable number is also involved in trading and other business activities. Gladys is in the business of palm oil production. She has been in business for ten good years and is full of rich experience. \r\n\r\nShe buys the palm nuts from the local farmers in her community; processes them in her house to produce the oil and sells it at wholesale prices to her customers. Palm oil is a local vegetable oil produced from palm fruit which has been cooked, pounded, sieved and boiled for hours. The reddish substance (the oil) is skimmed off and reboiled to expel its water content. Gladys desires to use the loan to expand her business by buying the palm fruit in bulk to be able to supply to more customers. \r\n\r\nShe believes the loan assistance would enable her to scale up production to serve larger market and eventually, help improve her family finances.

She also always gives them a \u201cyapa\u201d (a little bit extra that she gives as a gift).\r\n\r\nBlanca needs a loan of $1,100 so she can buy chirimoyas [also known as custard apples], grapes, and apples to stock her stall in the market. She is also planning to buy small animals and blankets for other small business deals that she occasionally does. \r\n\r\nBlanca has been a member of Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir for 10 years. She says that she likes earning money and saving. Her goal for the future is to continue working so she can be a good example to her children.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":344003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fruits and stock her market stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-06-28T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Aidee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956377},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:38:41Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956378},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63173748},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63173749},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:22:27Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599347},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599348},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035053},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035054}],"funded_date":"2009-06-29T12:50:46Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T17:43:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":122999,"name":"Sabrina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sabrina tiene 30 a\u00f1os, es madre de 2 hijos, vive con su pareja, su abuelito y su hermana.

She lives with her husband, her grandfather, and her sister.  They live in her mother's house.  She has sold saw blades for two years, a business that she has with her husband.  Both of them go out to sell this product in the shops where people work with wood.  What Sabrina likes about her job is getting to know many places and to learn more every day about her business.  It is profitable for her because she sells at an accessible price, and she goes directly to the people that use these saw blades.  In the future, Sabrina wants to have a store where she can sell a larger quantity and variety of tools and instruments for woodwork.  This is her third loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and what she likes about her communal bank is that all of her fellow members are responsible and united.
