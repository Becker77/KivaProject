She knows that more items in her store will yield more sales and thus increase her earnings. Her income from her store is a stable source to sustain her family's basic needs and for the education of her children. Aside from her small general store she also has a van for rent. She thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. <br \/><br \/>Aurora dreams of having a bigger general store and aims to give her children the possibility of a college education to allow them better opportunities in life. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

","en":"Korotoumou, who is in the center of the photo holding two booklets, is a member of a group of 17 farmers registered with myAgro, living and working in the village of Banantoumou in the southeast of Bamako, Mali. Korotoumou, aged 55, is the mother of 11 children aged between 10 and 38 years old, of whom two are presently in school. She explains that \"agriculture is our source of life.\" \r\n\r\nHaving a traditional foothold of the family in agriculture, principal source of income and food self-sufficiency for the household, caused Korotoumou to practice this activity for 50 years now. She cultivates peanuts and rice on her plot, but like any farmer, she has to deal with difficulties such as the lack of rain, of agricultural tools,  and of high-quality fertilizer. \r\n\r\nKorotoumou is just starting her first year with myAgro, and she registered because of the high quality seeds and fertilizer. This year she is making her payments to buy a myAgro package of OPV (openly pollinated variety) seeds and fertilizer to grow peanuts, so as to increase her yield from her  0.0625 hectare plot. She has been growing peanuts for 50 years for their nutritive value. She explains that peanuts can be eaten as they are by the family and are also used as a base for sauces in cooking. With the expanded yield and the income it brings in, Korotoumou is planning to do small-scale commerce. Finally, she hopes to be able to ensure food self-sufficiency for her family as well as paying for her children's weddings.

Cela fait maintenant 20 ans que Gninedje cultive l'arachide pour sa valeur commerciale, car l\u2019arachide est un aliment qu\u2019elle vend sur le march\u00e9 et aussi pour sa rentabilit\u00e9 productive et marchande. Gninedje planifie avec l\u2019augmentation de ses rendements et de son revenu  de faire de l'\u00e9levage. Enfin Gninedje esp\u00e8re aussi pouvoir couvrir les frais scolaires des enfants ainsi que construire une maison pour la famille. ","en":"Gninedje, who is wearing the white shirt in the photo, is a member of a group of three women farmers enrolled with myAgro. They live and work in the village of Bokoro, southeast of Bamako in Mali. Gninedje is 56 years old and the mother of seven children between the ages of three and 24, four of whom are currently attending school.\r\n\r\nThe rooting of her family tradition in farming, the household's primary source of income and independent subsistence, has encouraged Gninedje to take part in this business for 40 years now, as well as the independence farming ensures for her family. Gninedje grows ground nuts and corn on her plot of land and, as a farmer, must face challenges such as a lack of rain, farming equipment, and good fertilizer.\r\n\r\nGninedje is beginning her first year with myAgro and signed up because of the payment plan and quality seeds, as well as the good fertilizer. This year, Gninedje is making payments to purchase a package of myAgro OPV [open-pollinated variety] seeds and fertilizer for her ground nut crop in order to increase crop yields on her .0625 hectare plot of land.\r\n\r\nGninedje has been growing ground nuts for 20 years because of their commercial value; ground nuts are a food that she sells in the market for its profitability. With the increase in her crop yields and her income, Gninedje is planning to raise livestock. She hopes to also be able to cover the school fees of her children, as well as build a house for the family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50,"image":{"id":1879758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To obtain a package of OPV [open-pollinated variety] seeds and fertilizer to grow ground nuts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bokoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-15T21:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-14T21:40:06Z","loan_amount":50,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gninedje","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doufin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maramou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":25500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":50,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":25500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":29385.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401573}],"funded_date":"2015-05-15T21:55:04Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:14:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessalyn Pinneo","image":603028}},{"id":885297,"name":"Gita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"43-year-old Gita lives with her husband and son at Alipurduar of West Bengal, India.

Cow dung is used as farm manure by the cultivators in their village. He does not have any cow, so he purchases cow dung in bulk from village cow owners.

After the intervention of BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) in her village, Chaleya saw a ray of hope and she applied for a loan for the development of the business.

He is married, and has no children.   In 2010, Mohamed established his boutique (menswear) business. He began his business because he was trained up in business by his parents. With the experience gained, he decided to establish his own business.  His business is located on the outskirts of the city and his main customers are men and women.

They live and work in the village of Bancoumana, southeast of Bamako in Mali. Salimata is 50 years old and the mother of four children, one of whom currently attends school.\r\n\r\nThe rooting of her family tradition in farming, the household's primary source of income and independent subsistence, has encouraged Gninedje to take part in this business for 13 years now, as well as the independence farming ensures for her family. Salimata grows ground nuts, rice, red kidney beans, and does market gardening on her plot of land but, as a farmer, must face challenges such as a lack of farming equipment, good fertilizer, and quality seeds.\r\n\r\nSalimata is beginning her first year with myAgro and signed up because of the payment plan and training in farming techniques, as well as because of the conviction of the myAgro agents in regard to the advantages of the myAgro method. This year, Salimata is making payments to purchase a package of myAgro OPV [open-pollinated variety] seeds and fertilizer for her ground nut crop in order to increase crop yields on her .0625 hectare plot of land.\r\n\r\nSalimata has been growing ground nuts for 20 years because of their food production value; ground nuts are directly consumable for the family and are used as a basic sauce in cooking.

This year, Salimata is making payments to purchase a package of myAgro OPV [open-pollinated variety] seeds and fertilizer for her ground nut crop in order to increase crop yields on her .125 hectare plot of land.\r\n\r\nSalimata has been growing ground nuts for 43 years for their food production value [because] ground nuts are directly consumable by the family and are used as a basic sauce in cooking.

He went to the Foundation as it is the only place that helps entrepreneurs. With the loan, he'll be able to buy chicks, feed and allot a small area in his house; he already has the space, he just needs to fix it up. <br \/><br \/>Thanks to Oswal's experience in that type of business, he thinks that it will all go well and in the future he'll be a good microempresario. He aspires to grow his business to give opportunities to others to work with him.<br \/><br \/>He is grateful to the institution and to the Kiva investors whose support helps him reach and realize his dreams."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":579,"image":{"id":1876842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"undertake his business breeding chicks in order to economically support his parents.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2015-05-16T00:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-15T00:20:03Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oswal Jhoel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1960.28,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":91.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":92.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":95.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":93.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":100.32},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":101.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":101.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":106.32},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":106.81},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":109.07},{"due_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":112.68},{"due_date":"2016-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":113.75},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":116.16},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":119.03},{"due_date":"2016-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":121.47},{"due_date":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":123.69},{"due_date":"2016-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":126.31},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":128.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.07},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.12},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.89},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.53},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.6},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.03},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.92},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.38},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.62},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.26},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":202.27,"local_amount":200.76,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":202.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347906},{"amount":196.67,"local_amount":195.2,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":196.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696558302},{"amount":100.7,"local_amount":99.95,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711473235},{"amount":79.36,"local_amount":78.77,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":79.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752080569}],"funded_date":"2015-06-09T12:58:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Yuste","image":1669109}},{"id":885361,"name":"Ruthiana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruthiana is a single mother of four children, all of whom attend school.

Unfortunately, the first loan, which she got from local financial institutions, was very difficult to pay back, and Razmuhi faced some difficulties. However, thanks to her recent hard work, she and her husband have been able to run their agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that they will be able to cover the monthly payments. So Razmuhi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International.

Her family has been traditionally engaged in farm work, which is the main source of income and food for the household. She also married a farmer and has been doing farm work for 15 years now. Fanta grows peanuts, corn, rice and okra on her land plot. She faces challenges such as low rainfall and lack of agricultural supplies. \r\n\r\nThis is Fanta's second year with myAgro. She renewed her membership in order to be able to increase her yield thanks to the services provided by myAgro. This year Fanta is making payments toward a myAgro package of fertilizers needed  to grow peanuts and increase her yield on a land plot of 0.125 ha [0.3 acres]. Fanta has been growing peanuts for 15 years due to their nutritional value. She explains that peanuts are consumed  by her family direclty and used in sauces for cooking. Peanuts also have commercial value as  Fanta can sell them at the market. With an increase of her yield and her revenues, Fanta hopes to  become a vendor and to ensure her family has sufficient food.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1879770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a package of fertilizers for growing peanuts and take advantage of agricultural training offered by myAgro.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Baga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-16T04:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-15T04:40:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niele","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siaka","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Oumar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":81500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":81500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":81500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":88157.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401577}],"funded_date":"2015-05-16T07:46:37Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:14:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":882234,"name":"Vilma Haydee","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Vilma de 52 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su compa\u00f1ero de vida, ella se dedica a la venta de pupusas y comida, tiene 12a\u00f1os de experiencia en la actividad la cual inicio con capital propio, gracias a sus ventas es como ha podido salir adelante con sus ventas, ella esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de los ingredientes necesarios para la elaboraci\u00f3n de los alimentos como: chicharr\u00f3n, quesillo, ma\u00edz, frijoles entre otras cosas y asi seguir con sus ventas para tener mejores ingresos econ\u00f3micos.","en":"Vilma is 52 years old and lives in her own house with her life partner.

She lives in Horom village in the Shirak region with her big family of 7, her parents-in-law, husband, brother and sister-in-law, and two chidlren. \r\n\r\nArev's whole family is engaged in agriculture. They keep livestock: three cows, calves, a pig, piglets, and hens, as well as cultivating wheat, barley, and potatoes.\r\n \r\nArev and her whole family work hard to make income to cover the family's daily needs. Additional income would greatly assist the family. Arev has applied for this loan in order to be able to purchase wheat and barley seeds and fertilizer, and to hire workers to help her with land cultivation.\r\n\r\nBecause the region where Arev's village is located is considered poor, and the unemployment rate there is very high, people face numerous difficulties in developing their businesses. Arev's loan has been approved within the joint initiative between SEF and Kiva, which provides loans to the underserved population of the Shirak region to help them to access the market and earn a living.

Djeneba, who is 51 years old, is the mother of 7 children aged between 7 and 28, 3 of whom are currently attending school. Djeneba has been in this line of work for 10 years, inspired partly because farming is a long held family tradition (as the primary source of revenue and source of food self-sufficiency), and partly because she is married to a farmer. Djeneba grows groundnuts, millet, sorghum and beans on her plot of land but, as a farmer, has to face problems such as a lack of rain, a lack of agricultural equipment and a lack of good quality fertiliser. Djeneba is starting her first year with myAgro and enrolled thanks to the payment system and the good quality of the fertiliser, as well as the myAgro agents' conviction about the benefits provided by the myAgro method.\r\n\r\nThis year, Djeneba will be making payments so that she can buy a packet of myAgro OPV (Open Pollinated Variety) seeds and fertiliser so that she can grow groundnuts and increase the yield on her 0.0625 hectare plot of land. Djeneba has been growing groundnuts for 20 years for their nutritional value, as groundnuts are directly consumable by the family and are used as an ingredient in a basic sauce for food preparation, and because groundnuts produce good yields and good profits. Djeneba plans to use her increase in income to cultivate more produce on her land for resale. She has also mentioned that she would like to become a retailer of condiments because she is ill and farming is becoming more difficult for her. Finally, Djeneba would like to be able to cover her children's educational costs and to ensure her family's food self-sufficiency.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1879799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a pack of OPV seeds and fertiliser.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Karako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-16T08:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-15T08:50:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teninba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gnanakoro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Keniba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Astan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seignan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bouramaba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":171000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":171000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":171000,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":176315.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401583}],"funded_date":"2015-05-16T16:40:31Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:14:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":884373,"name":"Myriam Gemina","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Myriam est mari\u00e9e, son mari travaille dans une petite entreprise priv\u00e9e et son salaire est faible pour couvrir les d\u00e9penses primaires de la famille.Elle a 3 enfants de 13, 10 ans et 5mois.

","en":"Oumar (sitting in the middle in the picture and carrying a myAgro pouch) is a member of a group of 7 farmers who are enrolled with myAgro and who live and work in the village of Gwelekoro in the south of Bamako in Mali. Oumar, who is 49 years old, is the father of 15 children aged between 1 and 25, 7 of whom are currently attending school. Oumar has been in this line of work for 7 years, and was motivated to be a farmer because farming is a long held family tradition (as the primary source of revenue and enabler of food self-sufficiency). He was born and grew up in a farming community. Oumar grows groundnuts, maize and sorghum on his plot of land but, as a farmer, has to face problems such as a lack of rain and a lack of agricultural equipment. Oumar is starting his third year with myAgro and re-enrolled because of the payment system, the training and the agricultural techniques used.\r\n\r\nThis year, Oumar will be making payments so that he can buy a packet of myAgro fertiliser for maize production and increase the yield from his 1 hectare plot of land. Oumar has been growing groundnuts for 10 years for their nutritional value. Once his output and income has increased, Oumar plans to cultivate more produce on his land and to buy more agricultural equipment. Finally, Oumar would like to be able to cover his children's educational costs and to ensure his family's food self-sufficiency.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1879804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a packet of fertiliser.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Gwelekoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-16T09:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-15T09:10:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oumar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fassaka","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mekoro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamadou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amadou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chaka","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":316500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":316500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":316500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":323245.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401584}],"funded_date":"2015-05-16T16:40:31Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":885437,"name":"Yahaya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yahaya is a Babban Gona farmer from Gidan Kwabo Village.

","en":"Seiba (standing second from the right in the picture and carrying a myAgro pouch) is a member of a group of 5 farmers who are enrolled with myAgro and who live and work in the village of Gwelekoro in the south of Bamako in Mali. Seiba, who is 32 years old, is the mother of 5 children aged between 1 and 14, 3 of whom are currently attending school. Seiba has been in this line of work for 10 years, and was motivated to be a farmer because farming is a long held family tradition (as the primary source of revenue and an enabler of a household's food self-sufficiency) and she wanted to be able to ensure her family's food self-sufficiency. She has been farming since she was very young. Seiba grows groundnuts and okra on her plot of land but, as a farmer, has to face problems such as a lack of rain and a lack of good quality fertiliser.\r\n\r\nSeiba is starting her first year with myAgro and enrolled because of the payment system and the good quality fertiliser, as well as the favourable opinion of those around her concerning the positive impact of myAgro. This year, Seiba will be making payments so that she can buy a packet of myAgro fertiliser for groundnut production and increase the yield on her 0.125 hectare plot of land. Seiba has been growing groundnuts for 17 years for their nutritional value, as groundnuts are directly consumable by the family and are used as an ingredient in a basic sauce for food preparation, and because groundnuts produce good yields and good profits. Once her output and income has increased, Seiba plans to increase the amount of land she cultivates. Finally, Seiba would like to be able to cover her children's educational costs and to ensure her family's food self-sufficiency.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50,"image":{"id":1879809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a packet of fertiliser for groundnut production and to benefit from the training and agricultural techniques of myAgro.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Gwelekoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-16T09:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-15T09:40:03Z","loan_amount":50,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Seiba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madje","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":50,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":27000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":27000,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":29385.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401585}],"funded_date":"2015-05-16T11:22:44Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":885446,"name":"Sadafmo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sadafmo is a cheerful woman.

children. Her children are adults, and live away from home. Kanyshai has a secondary education, and has worked in agriculture for many years.

","en":"Lassine (sitting on the right in the picture, wearing a baseball cap and carrying a myAgro pouch) is a member of a group of 7 farmers who are enrolled with myAgro and who live and work in the village of Digato, in the south of Bamako in Mali. Lassine, who is 46 years old, is the father of 10 children aged between 1 and 20, 1 of whom currently attends school. The others have dropped out. Lassine has been in this line of work for 17 years, and was motivated to be a farmer because farming is a long held family tradition (it is the primary source of revenue and enables a household's food self-sufficiency) and he wanted to be able to ensure his family's food self-sufficiency. He was born and grew up in a farming community. Lassine grows groundnuts, maize and sorghum on his plot of land but, as a farmer, has to face problems such as a lack of rain. He has not had any problems with his fertiliser since joining myAgro.\r\n\r\nLassine is starting his third year with myAgro and re-enrolled because of the payment system and the good quality fertiliser. He really likes the myAgro training and the size of the plots of land. This year, Lassine will be making payments to buy a packet of myAgro fertiliser for maize production so that he can increase the yield on his 1 hectare plot of land. Lassine has been growing maize for 15 years because of its good yield. Once his output and income have increased, Lassine plans to increase the amount of land he cultivates and to buy more agricultural equipment. He would like to extend his land so that he can get more yield and sell the surplus. Finally, Lassine would like to be able to cover his children's educational costs and to build a house for the family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1879815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertiliser for maize production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Digato","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-16T11:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-15T11:40:06Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lassine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sayon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sekouba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":317000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":317000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":317000,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":323245.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401586}],"funded_date":"2015-05-16T16:40:31Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":882264,"name":"De Confianza Los Cerritos Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La asociaci\u00f3n comunal  de Confianza los Cerritos est\u00e1 conformada por quince integrantes trece mujeres y dos hombres, madres y padres de familias responsables de veinte hijos, algunos menores de edad, los cuales est\u00e1n estudiando, son originarios del Sauce lugar que est\u00e1 ubicado en la zona norte de le regi\u00f3n  y se caracteriza por ser trabajador, responsables, con ganas de superaci\u00f3n personal.

Cela fait maintenant 15 ans que Djeneba cultive l'arachide pour sa valeur vivri\u00e8re, expliquant que l\u2019arachide est directement consommable par la famille et est utilis\u00e9e comme sauce de base dans l\u2019alimentation et aussi pour sa rentabilit\u00e9 productive et marchande. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que, \"vu la grandeur de la famille, elle n'arrive pas \u00e0 vendre son arachide.\" Djeneba planifie avec l\u2019augmentation de ses rendements et de son revenu  de faire de l'\u00e9levage et d'\u00e9tendre la surface cultiv\u00e9e. Enfin Djeneba esp\u00e8re aussi pouvoir couvrir les frais scolaires des enfants ainsi qu'assurer l'autosuffisance alimentaire de la famille. ","en":"Djeneba (sitting on the left in the picture, carrying a myAgro pouch) is a member of a group of 5 farmers who are enrolled with myAgro and who live and work in the village of Digato, in the south of Bamako in Mali. Djeneba, who is 40 years old, is the mother of 9 children aged between 2 and 22, 3 of whom currently attend school. Djeneba has been in this line of work for 14 years, and was motivated to be a farmer because farming is a long held family tradition (it is the primary source of revenue and enables a household's food self-sufficiency) and she wanted to be able to ensure her family's food self-sufficiency. Djeneba grows groundnuts rice on her plot of land but, as a farmer, has to face problems like a lack of rain, a lack of agricultural equipment and a lack of good quality fertiliser.\r\n\r\nDjeneba is starting her first year with myAgro and enrolled because of the payment system and the good quality fertiliser. This year, Djeneba will be making payments for a package of myAgro OPV (Open Pollinated Variety) seeds and fertiliser for groundnut production, so that she can increase the yield on her 0.0625 hectare plot of land. Djeneba has been growing groundnuts for 15 years for their nutritional value, as groundnuts are directly consumable by the family and are used as an ingredient in a basic sauce used for food preparation, and because groundnuts produce good yields and good profits. Because of the size of her family, she does not have any surplus groundnuts to sell. Once her output and income have increased, Djeneba plans to raise livestock and to increase the amount of land she cultivates. Finally, Djeneba would like to be able to cover her children's educational costs and to ensure her family's food self-sufficiency.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":1879818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a packet of OPV seeds and fertiliser.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Digato","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-16T12:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-15T12:00:03Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":35500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":35500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":35500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":44078.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401587}],"funded_date":"2015-05-16T14:58:08Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":885460,"name":"Ma.

Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Lizelda would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 20,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Lizelda hopes to maintain an increasing profit from her business and then eventually save for the renovation of her store. Then if God will allow, she dreams to have her own supermarket someday. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

In addition to this, she also makes rugs for an additional source of income.\r\n\r\nTrash is not actively segregated in the Philippines and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, and papers. They sell these items to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries and factories. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nBaby Gail is taking out a PHP 30,000 loan which she will incorporate into her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of being successful someday with her business.

While many people find it useless, Adela, 54 years old, still finds it as a way to generate a living. Aside from this, she also has a piggery business where she gets additional income for their family necessities. \r\n\r\nSince, trash is not well-managed in the country and is just thrown anywhere along the sidewalks and riverbanks, street dwellers usually collect such things that are still recyclable like copper, papers, plastics and metals. After collecting, their next destination is to the junk shop where they sell such for a corresponding price depending on the material. Usually, metals cost higher. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries and factories.\r\n \r\nHowever, stable income from this kind of business is hardly predictable. Sometimes, the revolving fund that the junk shop operators use is not enough. This is why Adela is taking out a loan worth PHP 22,000 to add to her current revolving fund and also for improving the shop. \r\n\r\nWith her husband, Emilio, they are truly hopeful that someday their lives will get better and that their children will finish their studies and build decent lives on their own. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and business every week and to strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Zhamila has four cows and twelve sheep on her farm. She grows barley on 0.30 hectares of own land and 0.50 hectares of rented land. \r\n\r\nZhamila's monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). This money is not enough for a decent life. Therefore, with an aim to further develop her business, she turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase two steers to fatten and resell. \r\n\r\nZhamila plans to invest the income from the loan in further improving her business. She would also like to improve the family's well-being and save money for her son's wedding and her eldest daughter's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1882227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

Sata has been in this line of work for 20 years, and was motivated to be a farmer because farming is a long held family tradition (it is the primary source of revenue and enables a household's food self-sufficiency) and she wanted to be able to ensure her family's food self-sufficiency. Sata grows groundnuts and maize on her plot of land but, as a farmer, has to face problems like a lack of rain, a lack of agricultural equipment and a lack of good quality fertiliser.\r\n\r\nSata is starting her first year with myAgro and enrolled because of the payment system and the good quality seeds and fertiliser. This year, Sata will be making payments for a package of myAgro OPV (Open Pollinated Variety) seeds and fertiliser for groundnut production, so that she can increase the yield on her 0.0625 hectare plot of land. Sata has been growing groundnuts for 20 years because of their commercial value, as groundnuts are one of the foodstuffs that she sells at the market. Sata plans, thanks to an increase in output and income, to keep doing business.

Prior to his business, her husband learned repairing work and gathered those experiences and opened his own garage where he repairs cycles, vans, auto rickshaws, cars, etc. But due to the competitive market, there are many other garages nearby, so it has become very difficult for them to run the business smoothly. \r\n\r\nShefali requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BJS to purchase more modern tools and machinery so that her husband can do all types of repairing work to enhance their business. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan will give a boost to her husband\u2019s business, as well as the lifestyle of her family, with the profit generated from this business.

Whatever income she gets basically from her chosen trade, she uses for helping her husband in covering the family expenses. \r\n\r\nFilipinos are fond of eating heavy meals. Unlike some of foreign countries where people are only used to eating bread for lunch or dinner, most Filipinos can\u2019t afford to not eat rice with dishes during lunches and dinners. So it is a big help to most when there are food stalls at hand along the roads where they can eat  without going home to cook. Perhaps this is the reason why  Christine Mary has chosen to manage a food stall. Since food is always in demand, she earns good profit from this. \r\n\r\nHowever, Christine Mary still wants to expand her business. She is asking for a loan of PHP 10,000. She will use this to buy more raw ingredients needed for her recipes. She wants to express to you her sincerest thanks for your goodness and generosity until now. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she wants her family to experience progress and improve as well in her current business, to be able to save money for a future house. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Originally from the Dominican Republic, her son was diagnosed with mild autism and she needed a way to support herself and him while also meeting her child\u2019s needs. She started her daycare to be able to take care of her son while earning an income, and soon, what started out as a necessary job turned into a passion. \r\n\r\nMagali is currently working to complete her college degree while running a daycare center and being a mother full time. Despite the challenges, she loves what she does.

Her ultimate goal was to help people not only to look good on the outside, but also to cultivate beauty on the inside. She is a firm believer that \u201ctrue satisfaction begins when you become satisfied with the you on the inside.\u201d Her women\u2019s clothing boutique, Belle Vie Boutique 25, offers women\u2019s clothing, and is solely owned by Jamila.  She receives occasional help from her family and friends as she works to establish her store. \r\n\r\nHer business has not yet begun operations. However, she has received very positive feedback from her community when she released sneak peeks of her clothing lines. Jamila needs capital to invest in inventories and other business expenses to start operating her boutique. Her greatest difficulty has been securing a loan. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Jamila will be able to purchase clothing items and open her store. She is excited to expose customers in her area to new styles and even more excited to work with women in her community, helping them feel good physically, emotionally, and spiritually. In the future, she hopes to incorporate accessories and clothing for children and men. She also hopes to develop more interactions with her community besides clothing sales. She feels passionately about helping others improve their mental and emotional health, and hopes to create personal well-being workshops for her customers. \u201cI believe,\u201d says Jamila, \u201cthat there\u2019s no amount of outside beauty that can make up for emptiness and loss inside. At my boutique, my customers will get the best of both worlds.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1197.03,"image":{"id":1869248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase clothing items for her women's clothing boutique","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Georgia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2015-05-16T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-15T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":5425,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jamila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5415,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":5425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":191.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":194.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":199.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":199.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":202.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":207.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":208.03},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":212.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":213.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":216.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":222.54},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":222.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":226.91},{"due_date":"2016-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":228.71},{"due_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":232.9},{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":234.98},{"due_date":"2016-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":238.17},{"due_date":"2016-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":242.18},{"due_date":"2016-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":244.7},{"due_date":"2016-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":248.58},{"due_date":"2017-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":251.39},{"due_date":"2017-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":254.81},{"due_date":"2017-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":258.95},{"due_date":"2017-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":261.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.16},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.62},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.12},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":207.53},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.41},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":214.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.04},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223.02},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.13},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.41},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.61},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":242.63},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":245.15},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":249.04},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":251.86},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.28},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":259.43},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":386.93,"local_amount":386.21,"processed_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:12:52Z","rounded_local_amount":386.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681266531},{"amount":199.62,"local_amount":199.25,"processed_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":199.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696476540},{"amount":200.12,"local_amount":199.75,"processed_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":200.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711383319},{"amount":202.83,"local_amount":202.46,"processed_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":202.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730908590},{"amount":207.53,"local_amount":207.15,"processed_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":207.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":751999764}],"funded_date":"2015-06-01T14:19:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":885678,"name":"Andre","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Andre has always had a passion for technology.

to others whenever possible. She learned about contracting with the United States Postal Service, and eight years ago, founded her own courier service that provides pick-up and delivery services for businesses. What started as one small delivery contract soon boomed into four business contracts in five years. Currently she has 13 part-time employees and two consultants. \r\n\r\nBefore becoming president and founder of her company, Diane had over 10 years of management skills and experience maximizing business innovation and efficiency. Some of her past work includes humanitarian and activist work. She volunteered for the Front Porch Alliance, which sought to bring about community revival via faith based and other private agencies. She provided benefits to family and children, carried out activities for youth, coordinated a job fair, and helped to significantly decrease crime in eight targeted neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nDiane\u2019s company prides itself on punctual, cost-effective, and efficient services. However, her largest difficulty has been working in a network of companies and organizations where delays by one party can delay services to many other parties. She has also had difficulty making weekly and bi-weekly payments and payroll when company revenues only come in monthly. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this loan is to help with employee payroll. In the future, Diane plans to expand her company, maximize efficiency and customer satisfaction, and expand the services offered by her business. She also hopes to transition to environmentally friendly vehicles to minimize her company\u2019s environmental impact.\r\n\r\nCheck out her website at

She currently works as a dispatcher, and has been employed at the same job for many years. When Jennifer\u2019s mother passed away, she left an inheritance that was just enough to buy the modest home where she now lives with her family. <br \/><br \/>Jennifer\u2019s goal is to provide a safe and healthy environment for her children. Two of Jennifer\u2019s children have developmental disabilities, and caring for them is a full-time job in and of itself, but despite the many challenges, Jennifer has managed to find a balance between working full-time and tending to the needs of her children. Jennifer has lived within her means and continually lives up to her financial obligations, but due to falling behind quite some time ago while going through a family crisis, her credit score declined. <br \/><br \/>This issue has hindered Jennifer in financing a new roof that she desperately needs for her family\u2019s home. Their current roof has severe leaks, and is currently the source of mold growth within their home. There is also fear that the roof may collapse if water continues to collect within the sinks of the old roof.  <br \/><br \/>Jennifer is hoping that SELF and Kiva will help her fund a new roof so that her home will be safe for her children. Not only will Jennifer\u2019s loan replace her roof and provide a safe living environment for her family, but she will also rebuild her credit by making payments on time. <br \/><br \/>Jennifer will use her Kiva loan to pay for a new roof so that her family can live safely and healthily in their home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":741.4,"image":{"id":1882163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

Currently, Novelia has a business selling fruit ice (smoothie) and the business prospect is very good because so many people want to buy from her. \r\n\r\nDue to a lack of ingredients stocks, Novelia can only produces 15 up to 20 cups every day. Novelia then got information from TLM Account officer on the group loan product; along with four women they formed a group to receive loans from Kiva through TLM Cooperative.  \r\n\r\nNovelia is requesting a loan of amounting IDR 2,000,000 to buy more fruit such as papaya, apple, milk, syrup, as well as to buy phone cell credit.

They are single mothers who are responsible for six children. They are from Le\u00f3n which is located in the western part of the department of Le\u00f3n. These people are hard working and responsible, with the will to get ahead. Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources, they were unable to go to school. They found themselves having to go to work at an early age to help with the household expenses. Currently they struggle day-to-day to help their children get ahead and to offer them a better future.\r\n\r\nThanks to her desire to get ahead, Marta Reyna is the group\u2019s coordinator. As her business she has a \u201cpulperia\u201d, which is a small store with small amounts of edible products such as rice, sugar milk, bread, eggs, detergent, cheese and cheese curds, matches, cigarettes, ice etc.  The business is in her home. She works twelve hours a day every day, offering her products. She takes great pleasure in her work, and it supports her family.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the loan is to invest in work capital and to stock her business buying and selling edible products so that in the not very distant future she might earn a better income and satisfy her customers\u2019 needs. The Bendici\u00f3n de Dios group thanks the Kiva investors for the help that they give to people of few resources and poor countries such as Nicaragua, so they may have a dignified way of working.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":812.5,"image":{"id":1877080,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

sustainable food and material packaging\/shipping products, and non-toxic restaurant, janitorial, office, and healthcare cleaning supplies. Her focus is on promoting sustainable consumer goods and practices at affordable prices. Her business has recently has experienced a large boom, receiving an award by Ceres Unified School District, and gaining many new clients, including Sac State University and a few restaurants. Irenessa now needs to expand to an office and warehouse.\r\n\r\nBefore starting her own business, Irenessa worked for her family's shipping business. She started as a novice in the business, but, through her hard work and acuity, soon became the Director of Supplier Diversity.  Over the course of 14 years, she learned how to run a company and its operations.  \r\n\r\nIrenessa is originally from the Philippines, but grew up in Hawaii. She is the sole owner of her business and has one employee. She is proud of her business mission to educate people on the importance of being a good steward of the environment. She is also one of the first woman- and minority-owned businesses to focus on non-toxic cleaning products that help reduce consumer waste and improve human and ecological health. \r\n\r\nOne of her greatest challenges has been a lack of funding, which is limiting the number of customers she can attract. The purpose of this loan is to develop a website and help her store become certified as a minority and woman-owned company. Her vision is to grow her client base nationally and possibly globally. She plans to add a Green Consultant, and have her company become green certified. In the long run, she hopes to inspire younger generations to protect and improve the environment and to live more healthfully.

She lives with her family including one son and one daughter in Lahore, Pakistan. Her son has been running a mobile shop for the past 10 years. He sells new mobiles and mobile accessories such as chargers, batteries, hand frees, blue tooth devices, etc in his shop. He speaks with a monotonous tone, which is impressive and he easily wins the trust of his customers. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built very good relations with his customers. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Farhat's son requested a loan so that he would be able to buy more stock of new mobiles as well as accessories such as batteries, chargers, hand frees, and blue tooth devices to increase his business, but due to insufficient financial means, he was unable to purchase these accessories. Therefore, Farhat has applied for Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan, her son will be able to purchase relevant items for his business purposes so that he can earn a more profitable income to manage his business and household.\r\n\r\nFarhat is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1882283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy new mobiles and accessories such as batteries, chargers, hand frees, and blue tooth devices for her son's mobile shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2015-05-16T23:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-15T23:00:06Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Farhat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3622},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3727},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3836},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3948},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4064},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4183},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4305},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4431},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4560},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4694},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4831},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3799}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.36},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.6},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.94},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.31},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}}]}
