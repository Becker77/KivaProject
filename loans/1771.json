They live and work in the village of Samako, southwest of Bamako, in Mali. She is 64 years old and the mother of four children, aged 22 to 40, of whom all have been provided with schooling. \r\n\r\nMinata is rooted in the family tradition of farming, the main source of income and of food self-sufficiency at home. Because of this and her marriage to a farmer, she was encouraged to do this work for 47 years. She grows peanuts and rice on her parcel of land. But, as a farmer, she must cope with difficulties, such as the lack of farm supplies and manual labor. \r\n\r\nMinata is starting her first year with myAgro and signed up because of the possibility of increasing her yields through the services offered by myAgro, as well because of the positive image myAgro has in the neighboring villages. This year, she is making payments to purchase a myAgro packet of seeds and some fertilizer for growing peanuts, so as to increase her yields on her 0.25 hectare parcel of land. \r\n\r\nShe has been growing peanuts for 47 years for their commercial value as a staple crop. She explains that peanuts can be directly consumed by the family and are used as a sauce base in cooking. And peanuts also have commercial value, since they are a food she sells on the market. \u201cWe make everything with peanuts,\u201d she explains. \r\n\r\nWith greater yields and higher income, Minata is planning on working in commerce and purchasing farm supplies and equipment. Ultimately, she hopes also to cover her children\u2019s schooling costs, as well as to ensure her family\u2019s self-sufficiency in food. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1880497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to acquire a packet of seeds and some fertilizer for growing peanuts in order to increase her farm output","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Samako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-17T03:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-16T03:00:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gniakale","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nantene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kourouba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Farima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kone","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Camara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Namissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nansa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mousoni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Sata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Bourama","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Abdoul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":569500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":569500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":569500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":583795.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401590}],"funded_date":"2015-05-17T12:58:00Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":886021,"name":"Marilou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilou is a 49-year-old mother who was blessed with three children.

She said that \"growing cereals without fertilizers is a work of art\". Sitan is in her first year with myAgro, and enrolled to try out the myAgro model.\r\n\r\nThis year Sitan is making payments to buy a package of myAgro OPV (Open-Pollinated Variety) seeds and fertilizer to cultivate groundnuts and increase the crop yield on her 0.0625 hectare plot (0.15 acres).\r\n\r\nSitan has been growing groundnuts for over 40 years for its food value, explaining that groundnuts are directly edible by the family and used as a basic sauce for food preparations.

Moussa, 31 years old, is the father of 4 children, ages 1 to 6 years, of which none among them are currently schooled. The anchoring of the family tradition in the practice of agriculture, the primary source of revenue and of household food self-sufficiency, encouraged Moussa to practice this activity for 24 years now. \r\n\r\nMoussa cultivates corn, the sorghum on his plot, but must face up to the difficulties as a farmer; such as the lack of rain, of agricultural materials, and of quality fertilizer. Moussa has begun his third year with myAgro, and he reenrolled on account of the favorable opinion of his family on the positive impact of myAgro. \r\n\r\nThis year, Moussa carried out payments to buy a packet of myAgro OPV (openly pollinated variety) seeds and fertilizer to grow peanut plants in order to increase his yield on his plot of 0.0625 hectares. Moussa has now been cultivating corn for 24 years for his food-producing value and also for his productive profitability and in order to conduct business.\r\n\r\nFinally, Moussa hopes also to be able to build a house for the family as well as to assure the food self-sufficiency of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1880557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to offer himself a packet of OPV (openly pollinated variety) seeds and fertilizer for growing peanut plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougoula","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-17T11:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-16T11:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moussa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bourama","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daouda","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":108500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":108500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":108500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:01Z","rounded_local_amount":116759.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401594}],"funded_date":"2015-05-17T13:03:02Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Margo Berends","image":1019649}},{"id":886071,"name":"Intizora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Intizora is a hard-working woman.

Kadiatou grows peanut plants and vegetables on her plot, but must face up to the difficulties as a farmer, such as the lack of rain, of agricultural materials, and of quality fertilizer. Kadiatou has begun her third year with myAgro and reenrolled on account of the quality seeds and fertilizer, as well as the conviction of the myAgro agents on the benefits brought by the myAgro method. \r\n\r\nThis year, Kadiatou carried out payments to buy a packet of myAgro fertilizer for growing peanut plants in order to increase her yield on her plot of 0.125 hectares. Kadiatou has now been cultivating peanut plants for 40 years for their profitability and marketability. \r\n\r\nKadiatou plans with the increase of her yield and of her income to be able to conduct business.

Djeneba, who is 35, has three children between the ages of 11 and 20, none of whom attends school at present. Her love of farming incited Djeneba to take up this profession that she has practised for 10 years. Djeneba grows peanuts, millet, and rice on her land, but as a farmer, she has to cope with difficulties such as sparse rain and lack of farming tools. Djeneba is starting her first year with myAgro, she registered with them in the hope of being able to increase her production through the services proposed by myAgro. This year, Djeneba will make payments for a packet of myAgro OPV seeds and fertiliser for the cultivation of peanuts in order to increase the production on her plot of 0.0625 hectares.

Djeneba, who is 60, has five children between the ages of 30 and 40, none of whom attends school at present. Her love of farming incited Debi to work in this profession that she has been doing for four years now. Debi grows peanuts and rice on her land, but as a farmer, she has to manage difficulties such as drought and lack of farming tools. Debi is starting her first year with myAgro, she registered with them in the hope of being able to increase her production through the services that they propose. This year, Debi will make payments for a packet of myAgro OPV seeds and fertiliser for the cultivation of peanuts in order to increase the production on her plot of 0.0625 hectares. Debi has now been growing peanuts for the food producing qualities of this crop, for four years. She explains that her family can consume it directly, it is used in a sauce that is a basic in their diet, and also for its commercial value, for peanuts are a product that she can sell at the market. With the increase in her production and her income, Debi plans to start livestock farming. Finally, Debi hopes to enable her family to become self-sufficient for their alimentary needs and also to pay for her children to get married."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1880663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a packet of OPV seeds and fertiliser to grow peanuts, in order to increase production on her land.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Zamblebougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-17T13:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-16T13:40:05Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Debi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yiridie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wassa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Molobaly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bankoro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Molobaly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mandi\u00e3\u0192\u00e2\u00a8","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soungalo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zantigui","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chaka","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":315500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":315500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":315500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":321087.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401599}],"funded_date":"2015-05-17T14:37:01Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":886140,"name":"Shahida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shahida is a 42-year-old married woman running a cattle purchase and sale business with the help of her husband (also shown in the photo).

She is a passionate farmer and, because of her immense knowledge of farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nTaking care of her poultry is an activity that she finds very enjoyable, and feeding her poultry is her hobby. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in the Kitale area. Violet has good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market - the demand is very high. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she has always wanted to increase her poultry flock, so now she is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Accessing financial services for women is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising women like Violet can achieve their dreams and goals.

In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household.

This challenge was caused by poor a road network, impenetrable by motor vehicles, thus forcing farmers to rely on their backs, animal transportation and bicycles - all which were tiring and had limited load capacity. \r\n\r\nGilbert bought an Indian motorcycle and it was the perfect solution to this problem. The motorcycles are cheap to buy and maintain, they are agile, easy to ride and very economical. This made his biggest challenge go away, but the same challenge is still a reality to his neighbors. \r\n\r\nGilbert is seeking a loan of 90,000 KES to buy another motorcycle. With your loan, the newly acquired motorcycle will be made available for transportation services to other farmers in Mweru village. Gilbert will offer his services to farmers at an economical rate that will not hurt the farmers, and, at the same time, will be sustainable for his business. \r\n\r\nIncome generated from this venture will be used to repay the loan to Kiva lenders, and, after servicing the loan, it will help Gilbert meet the basic needs of the family he is starting with Doreen, his wife.

Though her responsibilities are important to her family, it\u2019s a job that is normally not given enough attention and gets little appreciation. \r\n\r\nWith the little time Susan has, she sells vegetables from their small farm and also keeps dairy cows, sheep, goats and poultry. From Kiva lenders, Susan is seeking a loan worth 65,000 KES to grow her horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government of Kenya takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. \r\n\r\nIt is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to give Susan access to a loan facility that will aid her to grow her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Susan\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability. Through this loan she will be able to sell more vegetables to both the local market and the neighboring market. \r\n\r\nKindly help out this enterprising woman with a loan!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":335.22,"image":{"id":1869660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To grow her horticulture business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-17T14:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-16T14:00:13Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.78,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.22},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.89},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.2},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.08},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":105.07,"local_amount":9756.46,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":9902.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378632},{"amount":108.87,"local_amount":10274.38,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:25Z","rounded_local_amount":10428.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.78,"payment_id":711506610},{"amount":119.5,"local_amount":11096.47,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":11262.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111597}],"funded_date":"2015-06-04T17:38:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":884780,"name":"Finess Ii Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Kadiatou est la femme tenant dans ses mains le drap et glaceur sur la photo.. \nKadiatou est malienne \u00e2g\u00e9e de 58 ans alphab\u00e9tis\u00e9 en langue national bambara, mari\u00e9e m\u00e8re de 05 enfants dont  03 scolarises et 02 non scolarises  dont l\u2019aine a 18 ans.\nSon marie est \u00e0 l\u2019exode, elle a une exp\u00e9rience de 03 ans dans la vente des draps , glaceurs , tissus brod\u00e9s et autre.

He does this work every day of the week during the fishing season, and when the season is done, he works with livestock. \"Fishing is an art that requires a lot of patience and sacrifice, fish meat is in high demand...\" he says. The advantage of his business is that at the end of his day he sells all his fish. The disadvantage is that fishing is seasonal. His dream is to expand his work, improving his tools and machinery. He wants to purchase fishing nets and make repairs to his boat for better safety.

She is happily married and is blessed with an adorable family. \r\n\r\nTo afford a decent and comfortable life for her six children, she has been selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and to make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Kitale area is highly populated, and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she says the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is very high. \r\n\r\nShe lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 40,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. As a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, Elizabeth feels relief knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will be able to sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry business to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe extra income she gains will be used in fully repaying the loan, changing her living conditions and securing her family's future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":320.49,"image":{"id":1869758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-17T14:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-16T14:10:10Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.98},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.97,"local_amount":6209.2,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":6220.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378638},{"amount":62.75,"local_amount":6000.21,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:26Z","rounded_local_amount":6011.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1,"payment_id":711506616},{"amount":190.77,"local_amount":17955,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":17988.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111603}],"funded_date":"2015-05-25T15:10:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":877984,"name":"Lydia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lydia, 46, is a smallholder farmer residing in Kitale, an agricultural town in the North Rift region of Kenya.

Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nShe passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated, \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d \r\n\r\nEunice sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet the demand. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow; it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10-20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to higher profit margins and increased income levels. \r\n\r\nProfits from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. Eunice is very visionary, and she intends in the near future to start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling, and also to start selling dairy products such as yogurt. \r\n\r\nAn improved income level will assure her family of a secure future.

Meet Nyasia, a hardworking, dedicated and honest 36-year-old dairy farmer. As the key breadwinner of her family and four children, she farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Nkubu, in the central region of Kenya. For the past 19 years, she has been practicing mixed farming and her primary source of income has been selling milk, eggs and maize. She also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income she earns through farming. \r\n\r\nNyasia passionately loves dairy farming but the biggest challenge she faces is lack of a proper dairy unit. She is kindly requesting for a loan to build a modern dairy shed. Through the loan, she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding it. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and it also protects them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. \r\n\r\nBefore Nyasia joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organisaiton that supports smallholder farmers with technical and financial solutions, she considered dairy farming not to be profitable. After training, Nyasia now believes that dairy farming is the business to go into if you want to improve your living standards. \r\n\r\nAn increase in income will allow Nyasia to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children. Her dream is to continue improving her dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards.

Her business is located in the municipality of Cotoca which is known for its ceramic crafts and its traditional foods.

She enjoys her life alongside her children who are students. They live in a rented room built of brick and cement with a roof of metal sheeting which has electricity and well water extracted with an electric pump and doesn't have sewer service. Due to her dreams of improvement, she established a bank of people with businesses like selling second-hand shoes, selling eggs, selling food, making curtains, a book store, repairing water heaters, selling soft drinks and selling second-hand clothing, to ask for a loan and to improve their businesses. Her business is tailoring, she specializes in alterations of all sorts of clothing such as the length of pants, the width of the waist, fixing tears, etc., work that she does in a room in her house during the daytime. At night, she has a second job. She works as a shift nurse at a public hospital. She receives emergency patients, does treatments, gives shots, etc., both jobs occupy all her time during the week. \"My family is large and with two jobs I manage to pay the household expenses...\" she says. The advantage of her jobs is that one has a fixed schedule and the other is free. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to invest in the tailoring business. Her dream is to open a sewing room to make hospital clothing. She wants to expand her business through the purchase of an industrial sewing machine and cuts of fabric to make hospital gowns. This is her second loan cycle with the institution in the 15 years that she has been doing both jobs. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons Maria asks for a loan to purchase an industrial sewing machine and cuts of fabric to make hospital gowns. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":1876060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase an industrial sewing machine and cuts of fabric to make hospital gowns.

She is an enterprising, optimistic, patient, responsible, and very hard-working, good mother.  She conducts her business in the Plan 3000.  It is one of the most heavily populated areas in the city.  People who were born in the city live there as well as migrant residents from other cities.  It is located on the outskirts of the city, and it is an area that lacks basic services.  The climate is hot, sub-tropical with a temperature that varies during the day between 21-35 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nLaura has a dark complexion, brown eyes, and long black hair that she ties back in a ponytail.  She is short and sturdy.  Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family.  She speaks Spanish with the general public and in the business that she conducts.  (She is seated, second from the left.  She has on a lilac blouse with a V-neck.) \r\n\r\nShe enjoys her life together with her life partner, who works in construction, and her children.  Her oldest child goes to school and works.  The youngest is finishing school.  They live in a rented room built of bricks and cement with a corrugated metal roof.  They have electricity and water that is pumped from a well.  They do not have indoor plumbing.\r\n\r\nDue to her wish to improve, she set up a bank of people with businesses like selling dairy products, selling food, selling flowers, selling chicken, selling empanadas, selling costume jewelry, and selling toys.  The bank was established in order to request a loan and improve their businesses.  \r\n\r\nHer business is selling food and basic needs items in her neighborhood store.

She lives with her partner, doesn't have children, and works selling food. She is entrepreneurial, independent, optimistic, patient, constant, responsible, and very hard working. She works in the \"Tundy\" community located in an area which holds ancient communities for over 300 years.  34 communities reside in this area including  cambas, guarani, chuiquitanos, collas, and menonites. The area has a warm climate, sub tropical, with a temperature which fluctuates between 21-35 degrees Celsius. Maria is dark skinned, brown eyes, with long dark hair tied in a ponytail, short stature, medium built. Her native tongue is Guarani which she speaks at home and she speaks Spanish for general knowledge and for business. (She is seated in the middle, wears a green blouse.) She shares her life with her partner who works as a driver. They live in a rented room built of brick and cement, with a corrugated metal roof, electricity, and well water. They don't have sewage. Because of her desire to get ahead, she organized a group of people with businesses such as: purse sales, sao hat manufacturers, agriculture, wood handicraft, palm leave adornments for decoration, pig growers, carpentry, fruit sales, milk sales, seed sales, and used clothing sales, to be able to get loans and improve their businesses. She works selling traditional foods such as charque majadito (beef jerky, rice, fried egg, and fried banana,) stuffed cogote (Creole chicken neck, stuffed with potatoes and churiqui (meat),) majao encapao (beef jerky, boiled plantains, and rice) and others. She works during the week in her fixed food stand. \"...I put up two umbrellas, put together some benches to sit down, and I serve food...\" she states. The advantage of her business is that she has steady clients, the disadvantage is the lack of furniture to serve them. Her dream is to open a restaurant. She wants to invest in her business by buying umbrellas, tables and chairs to serve more clients. This is the first loan with the institution in one year of working in this activity. Thus, Maria is asking for a loan to buy furniture for food sales and to open a restaurant."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5850,"image":{"id":1875919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy furniture for food sales and to open a restaurant.

This is Zeddy, a woman with grand aspirations who is humble and grateful. She lives in the Kericho area of Kenya, renowned for its rolling hills carpeted in manicured tea plantations. Zeddy is a loving mother and she has been in the agriculture business for more than a decade. Her primary income sources are eggs, and vegetables. Zeddy has been relying on agriculture to provide all her income. However, the rising costs of farming inputs (such as for fertilizers) and fluctuations in market prices are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. Despite these tough conditions, Zeddy remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. \r\n\r\nZeddy is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of business least affected by harsh external conditions. Poultry farming is cheaper to run and the demand for chicken products is always high.

Gilbert, 30, has been farming for the past 10 years. Through these years, he has gained much experience and is considered among the best farmers in his village. He  practices mixed farming. His primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops, and some small business ventures that help him make ends meet.\r\n\r\nGilbert is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating his farm. That is why, every day, he wakes up very early to go to his farm to plow. Although he makes profits from farming, he is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase his income by selling cereals. \r\n\r\nThat is why he is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Kericho area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereal. This means that Gilbert could increase his profits and satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Gilbert, but he now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring men farmers like him turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. \r\n\r\nGilbert believes that this loan will be of much help, and that he will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals.

He wants to lay a good foundation for his family and grandchildren to come, which is why he started farming and has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. His primary sources of income have been eggs, crops, and some personal business that he does so as to accumulate more wealth. \r\n\r\nJonathan is very passionate about dairy farming and, as he always says, \u201cdairy farming is close to my heart. Dairy farming in Kenya has seen an upsurge in growth, and milk prices in the recent past have skyrocketed, which has translated to increased earnings for farmers. Jonathan, being a very hardworking and visionary farmer, will want to take advantage of the ready market, which is why he requested a loan from Juhudi Kilimo, which he will use to buy a good quality breed of dairy cow. Jonathan has already decided what type of dairy breed he requires and, because of his immense knowledge on preparing hay, his cows will have plenty of food and will produce more milk. Jonathan projects that the cow he acquires with the loan will be producing more than 10 liters a day. \r\n\r\nBecause there is a ready market for milk, he does not worry too much about competition, and marketing the milk will not be a challenge. He will be selling it directly to the market as well as to big dairy processing firms, which will result in increased earnings. Additionally, Jonathan has planned that instead of selling the milk in its raw form, he will be packaging the milk, and this will also improve his income.

She is hardworking, charismatic and cheerful, and has a very good sense of humour. These qualities have been her inspiration to work hard on her farm.\r\n\r\nWith children to raise, water to fetch, and food to cook, Edith has little time to make money to financially support her family. With the little time Edith has left, she sells crops from the family's small farm and also keeps dairy cows and poultry.\r\n\r\nEdith is seeking a loan of 50,000 Kenyan shillings from Kiva lenders. She will use the loan to buy seeds and grow her horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by steadily rising exports.\r\n\r\nAlthough experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that people with small farms and poor farmers are included in the opportunities in this market sector. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to give Edith access to a loan. This loan will assist her in growing her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increasing employment opportunities, and bringing about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Edith\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of the family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":264.89,"image":{"id":1873395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy seeds to start horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-17T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-16T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.85,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.61,"local_amount":8328.04,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":8687.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378674},{"amount":83.79,"local_amount":7694.92,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":8027.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.85,"payment_id":711506663},{"amount":88.64,"local_amount":8058.24,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":8406.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111649}],"funded_date":"2015-06-14T15:05:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Pike","image":2004103}},{"id":882644,"name":"Sixto David","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sixto tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero, vive en casa familiar en el distrito de Oyot\u00fan, la cual es una zona rural que se dedica a la agricultura, comercio y crianza de animales, ubicado en la provincia de Chiclayo, regi\u00f3n Lambayeque, en la costa norte de Per\u00fa.\n<p>\nEl se dedica a brindar servicio de jornaler\u00eda como pe\u00f3n agr\u00edcola, realiza esta actividad desde hace 15 a\u00f1os por lo que cuenta con experiencia en este negocio y con buenas referencias personales y laborales en su comunidad.

Meet Nancy, a very hardworking, energetic and honest mum who is 44 years of age. She lives in the rich highlands of Kerugoya. Nancy has been practicing farming for the past 10 years, and through those years she has been able to support her family. Her primary sources of income are eggs, milk, and crop farming. \r\n\r\nThe Kerugoya area is populated and has a ready market for poultry products. However, Nancy's biggest challenge is lack of funds, which is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Poultry farming is one of the profitable business ventures in Kenya and you don\u2019t need to be a large-scale farmer to benefit from it. Through the loan, Nancy will be able to sell eggs, meat and poultry feathers to the already existing market. The demand for chicken is always high, being such a popular meal for many people as can be proved when you visit fast food joints in her area. \r\n\r\nNancy has been facing challenges accessing finances but she feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva are there to make her dream come true.

Meet Grace, a 36-year-old mother who is so humble, honest, and a very hardworking woman on this planet Earth. Grace is a mother of a lovely family that she really adores so much, and will always do anything good so that they never go to bed with hungry stomachs.  Grace hails from the Kerugoya area of Kenya. Grace never got the opportunity to advance her education and get a white-collar job but this did not kill her dream of wanting to succeed in life. \r\n\r\nGrace started farming and has been doing farming for the past three years. Through those years she has gathered so much experience, and all the farming techniques are at her fingertips. Grace practices mixed farming on her farm, and through the profits she has managed to take care of her family's needs and also give her children a good education because she believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success.\u201d \r\n\r\nGrace is a woman who is very enterprising, and she is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 to buy seedlings and start horticulture farming on her farm. Grace wants to take advantage of the favorable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, and reap more profits. Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women like Grace make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. Grace hopes that through the loan she will improve her living conditions.\r\n\r\nGrace's dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year she will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. Through this she will be able to assure her children a secure future and uninterrupted learning because she will be able to pay tuition fees on time. Grace is not a selfish woman, and will also want to positively impact society; that is why she will employ people to work for her on her horticulture farm, hence having an impact on society."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":158.47,"image":{"id":1873563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-17T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-16T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.51,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.34},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.96},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.2,"local_amount":5003.43,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5140.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378678},{"amount":50.88,"local_amount":4743.77,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4873.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.51,"payment_id":711506667},{"amount":52.88,"local_amount":4881.29,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5014.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111653}],"funded_date":"2015-05-17T22:04:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":880147,"name":"Yzeir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Yzeir, a villager in his late 50\u2019s who has been doing agriculture and livestock for a very long time.

Meet Agnes, who is 48 years old and has a clear vision of what she wants for her life: she is dedicated to succeeding and having a good life along with her family. She hails from Ndaragwa, which is a small rural town in the Central province of Kenya. This mother of four is interested in many farming activities. Currently, she is doing dairy farming, maize farming and poultry. She has put the last 10 years of her life into agriculture. She loves it! Her main sources of income are milk and poultry. She makes extra money on the side through venturing into other personal businesses. She is very appreciative of the fact that farming has sustainable returns. This enables her to enjoy profits and expand. \r\n\r\nAgnes is seeking a loan to purchase a chaff cutter, which is a mechanical device that she will use in cutting straw or hay into small pieces before being mixed together with other forage to feed her cows. Agnes has been having problems feeding her cows: most of the time her cows refuse to eat, but the chaff cutter will aid the animals' digestion and prevent the cows from rejecting any part of the food. Through proper feeding, her cows will produce more milk and, hence, increase income through milk sales. Agnes believes the key to increased milk production is proper health. A dairy cow needs roughage and protein in her diet to be healthy. A healthy cow is more productive, and that means more income for the owner. Through increased income from milk selling, she will provide a better life for her family and afford her children's education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":245.66,"image":{"id":1873687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a chaff cutter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ndaragwa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-17T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-16T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.41,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4954.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5098.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5247.9},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5401.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5559.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5721.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5888.8},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":6060.9},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6238.03},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6420.35},{"due_date":"2016-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6607.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6801.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":138.8,"local_amount":13086.39,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":13296.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.41,"payment_id":711506673},{"amount":105.45,"local_amount":9841.57,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":9999.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111656}],"funded_date":"2015-06-10T13:07:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":880040,"name":"Phillis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wonderful Kiva lenders, Juhidi Kilimo is introducing to you Phillis, a country woman full of dreams and ambitions -- chiefly to improve her family's life through the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nThis goal is why she went into the business of raising poultry and dairy cows, which is a common livelihood in the Kerugoya area of Kenya.

However, Sharon is a mother who never gives up despite the weather or situations that happen. She always manages to meet the requirements of her family. She gets up very early in the morning to go to her farm where she works. She owns a small piece of land together with her lovely husband. They have been blessed with adorable children. On the land, they have kept dairy cattle and grown vegetables for five years. Their main income sources are milk and crops. They recently ventured into a small personal business to supplement the meager income they earn. From Kiva lenders, Sharon is seeking a loan of 50,000 KES to grow her horticultural business. Loans to smallholder farmers in Kenya are hard to get and it is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to afford Sharon access to a loan facility that will help her to grow her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector.

She is considered a pacesetter when it comes to farming in her village of Mugwe in the Chuka area of Kenya. Having done mixed farming for the past 37 years, she has gained much experience and she offers free extension services to young upcoming farmers. Catherine is happily married and blessed with a lovely family. \r\n\r\nCatherine enjoys generating income from selling milk, her harvest, and produce from her farm. She finds dairy farming very fulfilling, but the main challenge she faces is not being able to properly feed her dairy cows. She is seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter. She will be able to cut hay into small pieces before mixing it with other forage to feed her cattle. The chaff cutter will aid her cattle in digestion and will prevent her dairy cattle from rejecting any part of their food. Proper feeding of cattle is one of the most important factors in maintaining high yield production of milk. Through proper feeding, her cow will produce more milk and this will translate into more profits and improved living standards. When she was asked how this loan will benefit her family, Catherine said \u201cmore income.\u201d Profits from the loan will be used in fully repaying the loan and improving standards of living for her parents, family, and her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":207.41,"image":{"id":1874365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a chaff cutter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-17T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-16T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.5,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2703.64},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2782.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2863.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2947.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3033.82},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3122.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3213.74},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3307.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3404.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3503.82},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3606.22},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3711.61},{"due_date":"2016-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3820.01},{"due_date":"2016-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3931.72},{"due_date":"2016-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4046.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.43},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.37},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.35},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.45},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.83},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.02},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.25},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.2,"local_amount":6745.44,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7053.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378685},{"amount":63.95,"local_amount":5859.18,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":6127.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.5,"payment_id":711506678},{"amount":68.76,"local_amount":6251.04,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":6536.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111658}],"funded_date":"2015-05-18T22:02:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":880312,"name":"Felleze","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felleze wants to buy feed for her cow.

Province, Kenya. She owns a half-acre farm on which she has practiced mixed farming for thirty years.\r\n\r\nThis kind, loving mother keeps dairy animals and poultry and grows tea and vegetables. She is very hardworking and is determined to increase her farm's output.\r\n\r\nRoselyn is part of a self-help group of fifteen members that call themselves Kapkottet self-help group. She is seeking a 50,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy seeds to improve her horticulture farming.\r\n\r\nLoans for smallholder farmers with little and irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. There are only a few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo that support farmers like Roselyn. It uses group-based savings as collateral. It facilitates loans that empower smallholder farming women, as it believes that women, too, are actively involved in agriculture. Juhudi Kilimo represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders. It looks to empowering both unskilled and semi-skilled women, since, in the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household.\r\n\r\nThrough this loan Roselyn will be able to sell horticulture produce both in the domestic market and in other international markets and this will translate to increased earnings and an improved standard of living.

Lukens","image":null}},{"id":880641,"name":"Dickson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Listening to Dickson referring to the different breeds of dairy cows on his compound, one would mistake him for a certified Agricultural Extension Officer. Dickson, from Chuka, a remote town in Kenya, is an active and progressive farmer in his locality. He has a wife and together they live on a small piece of land. Traditionally, his primary source of income has been eggs, crops, and a personal business, and he has been practicing farming for the past 11 years. Having done farming for such a long time, he has gained so much experience that he is always ranked the best farmer in his village. \r\n\r\nKenyans drink a lot of milk. This tradition is probably derived from tribal culture - particularly the Kikuyu tribe (Dickson\u2019s tribe) - where cows represent wealth. Demand for dairy milk has been high and Dickson wants to take advantage of the market. Therefore, he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is another profitable agricultural venture in Kenya and Dickson has already identified the breed of dairy cow that he wants. Dickson always says that, \u201cTo become a successful dairy farmer, one does not need to be a livestock expert. All one needs is passion, information, and keenness to learn from the successful farmers.\u201d \r\n\r\nHe has planted so many trees on his farm that food for the cattle will never be a problem. Marketing of the dairy milk and dairy products will not be a challenge, because he will sell the milk directly to the market and also to big dairy processing firms. Through the loan, Dickson will not only benefit from milk, but will also benefit from manure (cow dung) that will be used in improving the fertility of his farm, thus saving money that would have been spent buying fertilizer. Dickson has been facing challenges in accessing finances, but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, are there to make his dream come true. Dickson chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loans is low and is on a reducing basis. Dickson underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and during the training session, he learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. Through accumulated profits, Dickson plans to permanently improve his living conditions, and to secure the future of his school-aged child by paying tuition fees for him.

She is from the Chuka area, an area that is very affected by poverty, inequality and social conflict. She intends for her family to get ahead through her hard work and effort without complaint.\r\n\r\nEmily has spent the past 20 years of her life farming. She sells milk, poultry and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in a personal business to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nEmily is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. Of all the activities in which she involves herself, dairy farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and milk her cows and feed them with fodder that has high nutrient value. She is so keen and close with her cows, she has named them, which makes Emily very proud, and she feels fulfilled. Dairy farming being a very profitable business venture, Emily wants to take full advantage. She would like to expand her dairy business, but the biggest challenge she faces is feeding her cows.\r\n\r\nShe is respectfully asking for a loan to buy a chaff cutter. A chaff cutter is a mechanical device that is used for cutting hay into smaller pieces before being mixed with other forages for easy digestion by the cow. The loan will assist the cow in producing more milk because they will have plenty of food to feed on.\r\n\r\nThe profits from milk sales will allow Emily to grow her business further, by starting to package milk and by processing it into other dairy products. In addition, she will benefit from the organic manure from the cow. She projects that she will be able to start a bio-gas plant at her farm, which will save her money in fuel costs. With your loan, all that Emily dreams of is a secure future for her family.

She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kitale, in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. Annah is happily married and blessed with a lovely family. For the past 15 years, she has been involved in mixed farming and her main source of income has been growing maize, vegetables, tomatoes. She also keeps dairy cows. Annah has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She also operates a posho mill as a side business. \r\n\r\nAlthough Annah has made profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with the challenge of timely delivery of produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Annah mobilized other women in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that helps aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike.\r\n\r\nAnnah is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to market has been a challenge, which is why she has suffered so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables, and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan Annah is going to achieve her dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Annah feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women so that they can gain respect and equality. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Annah will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market and also she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. She is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in her community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work. With your loan, she will improve her living conditions and assure her children and grandchildren to come of a secure future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":187.91,"image":{"id":1875600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-17T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-16T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.22,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2580.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2655.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2813.41},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2895.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2980.26},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3067.35},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3157},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3249.26},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3344.22},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3441.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3542.55},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3646.08},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3752.63},{"due_date":"2016-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3862.31},{"due_date":"2016-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3975.18},{"due_date":"2016-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4091.36},{"due_date":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4210.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.23},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.2},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.23},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.29},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.38},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.65},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.84},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.32},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.68,"local_amount":6062.7,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":6249.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378692},{"amount":27.2,"local_amount":2510.97,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2588.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588413},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":2987.36,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3079.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.22,"payment_id":711506690},{"amount":29.64,"local_amount":2735.62,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2819.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023517},{"amount":33.03,"local_amount":3048.84,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3142.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111667}],"funded_date":"2015-06-16T15:00:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Salwen","image":812309}},{"id":881606,"name":"Consolata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello!

food for her family. Eight years down the line, Margaret is deep into commercial dairy and horticultural farming. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and vegetables. The money she makes from her various investments has helped elevate the quality of life of her four children who are in school.\r\n\r\nMargaret is seeking a loan to expand her horticultural farm. The crops she grows on her farm are insufficient to fulfill the demand. However, to grow more crops, she needs more income. Caught up in this situation, Margaret will find your loan very handy.

Meet Peninah. She is 31 years of age and a very hardworking, honest, and dedicated farmer who lives in Ikonge, a remote village in Nyamira. She is happily married and blessed with three adorable children. Peninah has been practicing mixed farming for the last ten years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has also been engaged in another small personal business.\r\n\r\nThe Nyamira area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, Peninah finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the very high demand. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 25,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry.\r\n\r\nBeing a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, Peninah feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved and she will be able to buy more poultry. As a result of the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate into increased profits and an improved income. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry business to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, permanently changing her living conditions, and securing the future of her school-going children.\r\n\r\nKindly help her out!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":127.97,"image":{"id":1876245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-17T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-16T20:00:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peninah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1769.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1821.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1874.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1929},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1985.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2043.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2103.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2164.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2227.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2292.98},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2359.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2428.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.62},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.81},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.51},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.96},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.72,"local_amount":3883.3,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4064.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378700},{"amount":19.35,"local_amount":1759.44,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1841.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588420},{"amount":21.76,"local_amount":1990.86,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2083.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.14,"payment_id":711506696},{"amount":22.1,"local_amount":2009.38,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2103.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023526},{"amount":21.9,"local_amount":1991.35,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2084.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111676}],"funded_date":"2015-06-10T05:34:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Salwen","image":812309}},{"id":882735,"name":"Carlos Humberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlso es un vendedor de frutas y verduras tiene su negocio bien ubicado y pro su largo recorrido ha creado muy buena empat\u00eda con sus clientes lo que le ha servido para fidelizarlos, su negocio es muy importante porque es la fuente de ingresos para su familia, no tiene una pensi\u00f3n, ni una persona que le ayude solo su negocio y empieza desde las 3 de la ma\u00f1ana yendo a surtir a la plaza para tener siempre productos frescos disponibles para sus clientes.\nCarlos quiere solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de surtido de frutas y verduras, su idea es ampliar su inventario ya que las ventas han ido creciendo y tiene que aprovechar esta situaci\u00f3n que ser\u00e1 muy lucrativa y beneficiosa para su hogar.\n","en":"Carlos is a fruit and vegetable vendor and has his business well situated.

Despite the weather or the circumstances that can happen, she is always ready to get resources for her family. She is a 38-year-old smallholder farmer based in Nyamira, which is a small rural town in Nyanza area of Kenya. Damaris and her husband have been blessed with three children. For 6 years, Damaris has been a mixed-farmer. She keeps poultry on her farm. She also grows maize, among other crops. Despite prevailing poultry diseases, she finds poultry farming to be the most enjoyable commercial farming activity. Besides poultry farming, she has a deep connection with gardening. In African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive hobby for women. You really don't have to be born with a green thumb to give life to a glorious garden; any woman with a homestead and a few square feet of earth is doing her best to make her little corner of the world more gracious and beautiful. Damaris, however, is taking this a little step further. Damaris is seeking a loan to buy seedlings and start horticultural farming. This is a big deal for her.

Beatrice is a 40-year-old mother of four who does mixed farming for a living. She comes from Nyamira (Nyanza province, Kenya), where she has been doing this work for six years. Her primary sources of income are selling eggs and maize, as well as some personal business. Beatrice\u2019s hobby is feeding chicks. She ensures the health of her farm by watering plants and tending to her animals. Beatrice is seeking a loan to purchase more poultry. Many rural farmers in Kenya keep poultry because it provides them with food, feathers, and companionship.

She is among the farmers who stand out for their strength, vigor, responsibility, honesty and friendliness. Florence has been practicing mixed farming for the last 24 years and has gained much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her family, she has been selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has engaged in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Nyamira area is very populated, and demand for poultry products, including eggs, is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable. She says that the most enjoyable part of poultry farming is, \u201cThe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the high demand. She lacks the funds to increase her poultry farming, so she is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nIt is very challenging for a woman her age to access funds but, through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva, she feels relieved to know that her dream will be achieved and that she will be able to buy more poultry.

She continues to work towards her goals today, since she needs more in order to support her daughters' education and general well-being. So she is determined to increase her sales and make her business more profitable.\r\n\r\nThat is why she has turned to a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, in order to buy perfume, cosmetics and cologne.

Meet Stella, 34 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Karingaini, a remote village in Chuka, Kenya. She is happily married and is blessed with one adorable child. \r\n\r\nStella has been practicing mixed farming for the last 12 years and has gained a great deal of experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her child, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and earn extra cash, she has also been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Chuka area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she states that the most enjoyable part about it is the increased profits she enjoys. \r\n\r\nStella's biggest challenge, however, is meeting the high demand. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy more poultry. Being a woman and accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved and that she will be able to buy more poultry. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the loan, Stella will be able to sell more eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate into an increased profit margin and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry market into other markets. She will use the resulting extra income to fully repay the loan, change her living conditions, and secure the future of her child."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":106.65,"image":{"id":1878218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-17T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-16T22:00:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.07,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.43,"local_amount":1727.23,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1854.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378720},{"amount":16.89,"local_amount":1501.58,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1611.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588434},{"amount":16.18,"local_amount":1444.51,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1550.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.07,"payment_id":711506715},{"amount":17.96,"local_amount":1596.87,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1714.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023541},{"amount":36.12,"local_amount":3211.04,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3446.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111693}],"funded_date":"2015-05-18T00:14:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":883155,"name":"Jairo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jairo se dedica al comercio de productos desechables y salsamentar\u00edas desde hace 6 a\u00f1os, cuando su padre, propietario inicial  de este negocio, empez\u00f3 a trabajar como conductor y se lo dej\u00f3 a \u00e9l, pues no le quedaba tiempo para atenderlo.

For the past year she has been actively involved in mixed farming. She has been earning good profits from her dairy. Anah is a woman with a great future ahead of her.\r\n<p>\r\nAnah has always wanted to diversify into horticulture farming, but her biggest challenge is her lack of capital.

In that course she learned all the operations of clothing production. Supported by one of her friends, Yesenia learned quickly how to operate a household sewing machine and later the stationary machine, with which she carries out her work today. She began to earn money and, little by little, Yesenia saved and began to buy each machine with which she organizes her small workshop. She began making her first dresses from her home. Yesenia makes blouses, sweaters, athletic clothing, dresses, pants, etc. working from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. without stopping. Her goal is to stock a warehouse with the clothing she makes. This is her dream of prosperity and a big challenge. \r\n\r\nYesenia is applying for a Kiva loan, her first loan, through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy basic materials such as fabrics and supplies like thread and applications, etc. with which to create outfits to sell to her customers. Her customer base is made up of mostly neighbors from her neighborhood, and the nearby schools. With this investment she will increase her production, making her Kiva loan a successful investment.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":99.61,"image":{"id":1878475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to buy basic materials such as fabrics and supplies like thread and applications.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-05-17T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-16T23:10:01Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.88,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yesenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":630000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":36362},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":46025},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":47291},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":48591},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":49927},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":51300},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":52711},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":54161},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":55650},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":57180},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":58753},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":72049}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.64},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.29},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.96},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.65},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":15.31,"local_amount":36362,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":37384.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.56,"payment_id":681350545},{"amount":17.45,"local_amount":46025,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":47319.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.64,"payment_id":696560809},{"amount":17.68,"local_amount":47291,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:47:29Z","rounded_local_amount":48620.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.96,"payment_id":711475544},{"amount":18.92,"local_amount":48591,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:25:26Z","rounded_local_amount":49957.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.29,"payment_id":730994409},{"amount":18.37,"local_amount":49927,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:22:54Z","rounded_local_amount":51330.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.43,"payment_id":752082374}],"funded_date":"2015-05-18T18:12:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Craven","image":1668972}},{"id":883120,"name":"Perisi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Perisi is a person who has had to overcome a lot of adversity in her life.

Besides mixed farming, Jazeline is also very concerned about the health of the environment.

Blanca arrived in Soledad, a place where her husband was moved to and since then she began her new life as a businesswoman. She used to run it from her old house that she left behind and decided to start up again. Blanca began promoting her business among her friends, she sold clothing on a credit system and filled her customers' orders. Little by little others got to know her and began to buy from her. Blanca did not stop there, she began to study design and production and added on to her business, offering clothing she made herself. \r\n\r\nToday, Blanca's goal has no end. She wants to expand her inventory and obtain her own brand. This would help her daughters to get an education of professional quality.  Blanca is applying for this Kiva loan, her first loan, through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. The loan will help her to buy fabric, thread, shoes, and women's accessories to produce more and increase her sales. That would make her Kiva investment a success.

Meet Lina, a 30-year-old youthful mum. She is a very hardworking, honest, and ever-smiling mother. She lives with her husband in a remote village in Kapsowar, in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. Lina passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past 10 years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding her family requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are milk, crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her parents and family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. \r\n\r\nThe main challenge that Lina faces is that her cows stray to her neighbour's compound. This has been causing many losses to her, because she has to compensate for the damages caused by the animals. She is requesting a loan to buy barbed wire.

He is a member of the group of 21 farmers registered with myAgro, who live and work in the village of Chocoro, southeast of Bamako in Mali. Solomany, age 34, is the father of three children, ages 1 to 8 years old, one of which is currently in school. \r\n\r\nThe establishment of the family tradition of farming and agriculture allows Solomany to ensure his family's self-sufficiency. Agriculture, the home's primary source of revenue and food, encouraged Solomany to work in this business for 25 years now. \r\n\r\nSolomany grows peanuts, corn, millet, sorghum, black-eyed peas, and soy on his plot of land. As a farmer, he must cope with difficulties such as lack of rain, farming materials, and quality fertilizer. Solomany is starting on his second year with myAgro and re-registered because of the payment system and quality seeds as well as fertilizer. \r\n\r\nThis year, Solomany is carrying out payments to buy a package of myAgro fertilizer for growing peanuts in order to increase his yields on his plot of .5 hectares. Solomany has grown peanuts for 25 years now because of their food-producing value, explaining that peanuts are directly edible for his family and is used as a base for sauce in cooking. With the increase of his yields and his revenue, Solomany is planning to start raising livestock and to diversify his techniques, i.e. a seed drill, plow, hoe. \r\n\r\nFinally, Solomany also hopes to be able to cover the tuition costs for his children as well as to ensure his family's dietary self-sufficiency. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1880733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to acquire a package of fertilizer for growing peanuts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Chokoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-17T23:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-16T23:40:04Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Solomany","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bouhima","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Drissa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nayouma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zoumana","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karamoko","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Bourama","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Seydou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":408500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":408500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":408500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":408657.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401600}],"funded_date":"2015-05-18T01:20:03Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett Ray","image":null}},{"id":882007,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is from Nyamira.

Josephine is happily married and blessed with a beautiful family. For the past 30 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary sources of income have been selling milk and farming crops. \r\n\r\nJosephine passionately loves poultry farming. When asked what is most enjoyable about farming, her reply was \u201cselling eggs\u201d. Her biggest challenge is the lack of funds to increase her poultry farming. She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry because she wants to take full advantage of the poultry business that thrives in Nyamira. \r\n\r\nJosephine is a member of hope self-help group and through the group, she has received training on financial management and saving. With the loan, she will be able to sell eggs to the local market and to her neighbors, hence improving her living conditions and rising out of the poverty.

With 24 years of experience in mixed farming, she runs a 10-acre farm where she conducts dairy, poultry, and crop farming. Currently, she owns two dairy cows, 10 heads of poultry, and a maize farm. Maize farming is a lucrative business, and it is her main income source. Hellen's family has a bright future, which seems to be dependent on the success of her maize farm. To safeguard quality production, Hellen is seeking a loan to pay for modern farm implements that are well-designed, versatile, durable, and more effective compared to traditional tools. Hellen is confident that replacing outdated tools with modern ones will also play a role in increasing her maize yields. Having an increase in maize yield at the end of the season will enable her to meet the growing demand in the market."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":87.11,"image":{"id":1879471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy farm implements","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-18T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-17T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.25,"local_amount":3222.34,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3479.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378723},{"amount":16.25,"local_amount":1444.3,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1559.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506724},{"amount":34.61,"local_amount":3076.8,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3322.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023546}],"funded_date":"2015-05-18T09:26:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":883747,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda is 47 years old, with three children.\r\n\r\nErlinda works hard to provide for her family.

world, meet Margaret. She is a mother of four with a deeply engraved passion for dairy farming. After all, that is what she has been doing for over 15 years. She owns a small farm in Shamata village which is situated in the Central Province of Kenya. The income she makes from farming is not sufficient to comfortably sustain her family. As a result, Margaret has ventured into a couple of small side businesses to make extra shillings. With the aid of her husband, Margaret also rears poultry, cows, goats and grows maize, amongst other crops. <br \/><br \/>Margaret is seeking a loan of KES 70,000 for constructing a cowshed. She plans to put up a well-designed barn that will provide a clean, comfortable home for her herd and a pleasant, efficient workplace for her. In a bid to increase milk production, the cowshed will provide a favourable environment for the cows. With your loan, Margaret has carefully planned for the storage and handling of milk, feed, bedding and manure, as these account for most of the labour on any dairy farm. The housing will have a plentiful, dependable supply of good water, made available 24 hours a day. The income she will make from this investment will put her in a position to comfortably afford increasing farming costs. Her family also stands to benefit from the growth of their agribusiness.<br \/><br \/>Help her out!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":188.72,"image":{"id":1873671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to construct a cowshed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ndaragwa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-18T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-17T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.9,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4954.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5098.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5247.9},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5401.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5559.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5721.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5888.8},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":6060.9},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6238.03},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6420.35},{"due_date":"2016-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6607.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6801.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":186.82,"local_amount":17613.84,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":17897.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.9,"payment_id":711506672}],"funded_date":"2015-06-16T02:17:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":883752,"name":"Felipa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felipa is 49 years old and has three children.

Her approach is to increase the number of poultry on the farm. To achieve this, she needs external financing. She is seeking a loan of KES 20,000. The loan will be used to buy a brood of hens that will lay eggs and hatch chicks in large numbers. The sale of eggs, chicks and cockerels will bring enough income for Vivian to comfortably pay her debt obligation and run the operational costs of her business. Once the loan is fully serviced, she can use the money to meet her family's basic needs and grow her business to greater heights.

Dairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. \r\n\r\nAlthough she makes a profit through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan, she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevents them from getting diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain.

She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.
