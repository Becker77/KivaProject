She started her business 20 years ago.  When she came from her native land, she realized there was no store nearby and she decided to take advantage of a commercial space in order to generate income.  This space is located on an adjacent side of her home in a business site.  Her sale of vegetables, groceries, dairy products, and other items that she permanently rotates in her business generates the need to have consistent inventory in order to have an impact on her customers' buying decisions.  In the event that her customers find everything they need, their decision to return is not expected.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why Lurdes turns to a Kiva loan and gets her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With this she will buy these items in order to sell more and generate additional income.  This will bring about financial stability and a better quality of life.  At the same time, she needs to make adaptations to her location by improving the image of her business and providing comfort in her daily work.  Lurdes works from 8:00 in the morning to 9:30 at night without stopping. Her goal is to fulfill her financial obligations and to create well-being for her family, which is made up of her husband and her 26-year-old

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase two UV water treatment systems with two 450 litre tanks, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nMadinah School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

Her goal is to be the leader of the group and to earn a higher income.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she is seeking a CrediKiva, which is the first loan that she requests from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

He started a family with Emmy, his spouse, 14 years ago and today they have four children. Paul has spent the last 15 years of his life doing farming. His main source of income through the years has been milk. In spite of being involved in other income-generating activities such as poultry, horticulture and tree planting, Paul's keen interest is focused on dairy farming.\r\n\r\nIn order to grow his dairy farm to greater heights, Paul's strategy is not only to increase the number of animals on his farm, but to ensure that the additional cows are something of pedigree quality. Paul's biggest challenge, until now, was finding a financier willing to loan him an amount sufficient to settle the steep price of a high-quality cow.  \r\n\r\nPaul is seeking a loan to buy a high quality dairy cow. With your loan, the newly-acquired dairy cow will have a big impact on Paul's life. His family will enjoy the prestige of running a highly-productive dairy business.

He also has 50 trees on the farm that will generate income at the right time in the future. \r\n\r\nJohn is planning to plant more crops on his five-acre piece of land this year. He is seeking a loan investment from Kiva lenders to purchase farm inputs. He needs your support because of the seasonal and unpredictable nature of farm produce. Farmers can invest their money in crops and wind up not making any profit due to many factors in the external environment. When such a situation happens, they need support from financial institutions to continue running the following season. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, John will be able to fertilize his farm and plant quality seedlings from an authorized dealer in Ndaragwa. He will use income from milk sales to make initial loan repayments until the crops are ready for harvest. This loan will have a positive impact on John's family's livelihood.

It also has commercial value, being a food she sells at market.\r\nBoulaye is planning to be able to extend the size of the plot he cultivates with his increased yield and higher income, as well as to diversify his plantings with orange and mango. Finally, he hopes be able to cover the childrens' schooling costs and to buy farm equipment.\r\nHe said \"after farming, I am obsessed with rearing livestock\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1880827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to get a fertiliser package for growing maize, and to benefit from agricultural training and techniques.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fanikodialan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-18T06:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-17T06:20:02Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Boulaye","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sidiki","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dramane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adjaratou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Massan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fantoh","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanamba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yiriba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soungalo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Finkolo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":523500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":523500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":523500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":525416.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401605}],"funded_date":"2015-05-18T11:06:30Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alistair Assheton","image":1674519}},{"id":884285,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emily is 39 years old and married with two children.

Coffee growing is Leopoldo's main source of income and replanting the estate is a matter of urgency as a good production means better income and a better quality of life for his eight children. \r\n\r\nLeopoldo is requesting a loan to be able to carry out the replanting of these 3.5 hectares from which he intends to obtain the best benefit possible. A loan would help Leopoldo buy all he needs to replant his estate, such as: coffee plants, organic fertilizer, organic consumables and to pay labourers.

This year she plans to buy fertilizer to increase the harvest of peanuts from her 0.125 hectares of land.

She is a member of a group of eighteen farmers who all work with the field partner, myAgro.  The group all live and work in the village of Fiana, south-east of Bamako, in Mali.\r\n\r\nMolobaly is 50 years old and mother to two children aged twenty and thirty years old.  Neither of her children currently attend school.  Agriculture is the primary source of income for Molobaly's family, and through this business she is able to provide enough food for her family.  Molobaly has been working in this business for thirty years.  She grows peanuts, millet and rice and has to cope with problems such as shortage of equipment and lack of good quality seed and herbicide. \r\n\r\nThis will be Molobaly's first year of working with myAgro to improve her profitability and benefit from the services offered by the field partner.  This year she plans to buy seed and fertilizer to increase the harvest of peanuts from her 0.0625 hectares of land.  She grows peanuts as they are a good source of food for families (often prepared as a sauce), and also a profitable thing to sell at the market.\r\n\r\nMolobaly will use her profits to expand her business and start raising animals.  In the future, she also hopes to be able to build a house for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1880838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seed and fertilizer to grow peanuts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fiana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-18T07:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-17T07:20:03Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Molobaly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussoni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samadie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seydou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bourama","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soumaila","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doumbia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samadie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doumbia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koumare","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koumare","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":543500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":543500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":543500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":554605.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401607}],"funded_date":"2015-05-18T12:25:32Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Ryder","image":1886035}},{"id":884488,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is married and she works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a rice retailing business in the Philippines and earns additional income from farming sugarcane and her general store businesses.

She is requesting a loan to cover her education costs and this is her story:\r\n\r\nHi, my name is Yenifer.  I am 19 and live in Licey, Hoya Grande, in the countryside of La Vega in the Dominican Republic.  I am originally from Cayetano Germosen in the province of Espaillat, but I grew up in Licey, Hoya Grande where my mother is from.  I have a brother who lives with me.  I am not married but I have a son who I love very much.  I struggle for him and my family.  I only have my mother now since my dad passed away when I was nine months old.\r\n\r\nWith all my heart I want to study medicine at the UCATECI.  I wish to help people like myself to get ahead by caring for their health through my knowledge.  I have not begun my education yet but I hope to choose the right subjects for my future development and interest.\r\n\r\nI am in need of a loan because neither my mother nor I have the resources to pay for my education.  My desire to study makes me determined to meet my goals, not only for myself but also for my family and everyone who needs my help.  I want to be good at what I do and that is my motivation.\r\n\r\nIf I do not receive this help I cannot get the education I want because I cannot afford the cost of the study program.  This loan will change my life, my future, my everything.... I truly need it.\r\n\r\nMy academic goals are to go beyond mere thinking, by demonstrating that \"You can do something if you really want to\".  After I finish my education I want to help people with low incomes and become more supportive and humble with those who need me.\r\n\r\nI want to help and go where no one has gone before, to be accepted and loved, and always to contribute my knowledge.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":7525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1878411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He separated from his wife but still fulfills his roles and duties as a father of three children between 3 and 12 years old. To provide for his family, Charles practices dairy, poultry, livestock, horticultural and lumber farming. He has over 4,000 trees on his 5-acre piece of land!\r\n\r\nCharles faces a big transportation challenge posed by the remoteness of his farm. He has to travel many kilometers to access the nearest market. This makes transportation of farm produce cumbersome and expensive to say the least.\r\n\r\nCharles is seeking a KES 60,000 to buy an Indian motorcycle custom-made for poor farmers living in hardship areas.

L\u2019ancrage de la tradition familiale dans la pratique agricole, source principale de revenu et de l\u2019autosuffisance alimentaire du foyer, mais aussi l'agriculture lui permet d'assurer l'autosufficance pour sa famille, ont incit\u00e9 Nianamba \u00e0 exercer cette activit\u00e9 depuis maintenant 50 ans.

She is standing next to a woman who is wearing a red t-shirt.  Nianamba is a member of a group of twenty-six farmers who all work with the field partner, myAgro.  The group all live and work in the village of Sanankoro-Djitoumou, south-east of Bamako, in Mali.\r\n\r\nNianamba is 60 years old and mother to three children aged between twenty-five and thirty-three years old.  One of her children still attends school.  Agriculture is the primary source of income for Nianamba's family,she often says that you continue learning in agriculture until your death.  Through this business she is able to provide enough food for her family.  Nianamba has been working in this business for fifty years.  She grows peanuts and has to cope with problems such as lack of rain, shortage of equipment and lack of high quality fertilizer.\r\n\r\nThis will be Nianamba's second year of working with myAgro to improve her profitability and benefit from the services offered by the field partner.  This year she plans to buy fertilizer to increase the harvest of peanuts from her 0.125 hectares of land.  She grows peanuts as they are a good source of food for families (often prepared as a sauce), and also a profitable thing to sell at the market.\r\n\r\nNianamba will use her profits to expand her business and begin raising either sheep or goats.  She says that the world does not stay the same, it is constantly changing.  In the future, she hopes to be able to cover the education costs of her children and provide for all the food needs of her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1880849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer to grow peanuts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sanankoro Djitoumou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-18T07:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-17T07:40:06Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nianamba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nahawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dodo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lassina","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elyzabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seydou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Fotigui","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Wah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Modibo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lamine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":347500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":347500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":347500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":350277.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401608}],"funded_date":"2015-05-18T12:46:07Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Ryder","image":1886035}},{"id":884497,"name":"Aracelie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aracelie works hard to support her family.

Es el primer  pr\u00e9stamo que ha recibido de FUDECOSUR. \u00c9l no hab\u00eda tenido antes otros pr\u00e9stamos en bancos eshtatales, pero FUDECOSUR le ha brindado el pr\u00e9stamo con mayores facilidades y la tasa de intereses mucho m\u00e1s baja.","en":"Marcos Vinicio is 24 years old and lives with his parents and siblings, who are his greatest priority. With the loan, he plans to purchase good quality bean seeds which adapt well to the conditions of the area and fertilizers and other products to apply them to the crop and to the development of the crop. In addition, he will pay labor costs to prepare the land and do soil conservation work such as contour cultivation and also applying the products and assisting the crop once it is developed, and in this way assure himself of doing good work. What he plans to do is to take advantage of the good conditions that the zone has for this crop, and also to implement his various years of experience in dealing with basic grains, in addition to being able to purchase the best products and of the best quality so that his crops develop well and healthily and also produce a fitting harvest, and to have in the short term a significant harvest. With the income of the harvest that he hopes to get, he wants to use it for his family's well-being and education and to achieve some family goals and continue investing more in his crops. This is his first loan that he has gotten from FUDECOSUR. He has never had other loans in state banks before, but FUDECOSUR has offered him a loan with better terms and a much lower interest rate. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1878698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to plant beans.

However, crop failure is still a sad reality caused by lack of water dry seasons. \r\n\r\nBenson seeks approach to dealing with crop failure problem by introducing irrigation on his farm. Introducing irrigation is a big step for rural smallholder farmers because it requires heavy investment on acquiring parts, transporting them to the farm and setting them up, a challenge Benson is willing and ready to take. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to purchase an irrigation kit. Benson will spend the loan amount to buy a water tank and pipes.  \r\nThis loan will help ensure that Benson's farm stays moist throughout the year and the crops stay green, strong and healthy.

He owns a small piece of land which he utilizes by keeping sheep and growing food crops and trees. To make extra income, Patrick is planning to venture into cereal trading business. \r\n\r\nThe way cereal trade works is: a trader will aggregate cereal produce in bulk from farmers during harvesting period, when the circulation is high and price is low;then the traders will store, process, package, transport and sell to final consumers when the circulation is low and prices are higher. The difference in buying price and selling price is the traders gross income.

She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Nyamira, which is in the Nyanza region of Kenya. Gladys is happily married and is blessed with three lovely children. For the past 5 years, she has been involved in mixed farming and she grows maize and vegetables. She also has dairy cows. Gladys has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with a challenge of delivering the produce in a timely manner to the market. \r\n\r\nThis challenge has not made her give up and she states: \u201cI have to do something for my family\u201c. Gladys joined Juhudi Kilimo which is a micro finance institution that assists aspiring women like herself. \r\n\r\nShe requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike and a posho mill. Gladys is from a remote village that has poor roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) which require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Gladys to achieve her dream and reach her goals. \r\n\r\nGladys village has no electric posho mill and through this loan she will be able to grind maize and other cereals for her neighbours and also for the entire village which in turn will bring her income. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Gladys feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women to gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of this loan are astronomical because Gladys will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering produce to the market and also she will get income through the posho mill business. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. Her income will increase. Gladys is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work. Gladys will use the loan to improve her living conditions and assure her children and grandchildren of a secure future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":478.45,"image":{"id":1876335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a motorbike and a posho mill for the future welfare of her business and her family","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-18T12:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-17T12:10:02Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.47,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":180000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":7741.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":7967.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":8200.56},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":8440.22},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":8686.89},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":8940.76},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":9202.06},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":9470.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":9747.78},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10032.65},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10325.86},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10627.63},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10938.22},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":11257.89},{"due_date":"2016-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":11586.97},{"due_date":"2016-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":11925.53},{"due_date":"2016-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":12274.06},{"due_date":"2016-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":12632.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.7},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.37},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.13},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.97},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.89},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.9},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.18},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.46},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.83},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.31},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.88},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.56},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.06,"local_amount":8816.25,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8869.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378706},{"amount":77.72,"local_amount":7363.35,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:16Z","rounded_local_amount":7408.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588423},{"amount":93.38,"local_amount":8891.11,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":8945.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.47,"payment_id":711506700},{"amount":63.47,"local_amount":6012.49,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":6049.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023529},{"amount":150.35,"local_amount":14243.68,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:07Z","rounded_local_amount":14330.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111680}],"funded_date":"2015-06-10T20:53:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":886094,"name":"Sharqiya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sharqiya is 35 years old and a married woman, who has two  children.

station- forced to travel by high prices back home. In one of the buses, a young woman named Lynn sleeps huddled up in her blanket and awaits the opening of shops. Soon there is a noisy discussion, as fellow Zimbabweans who fled the economic hardship, enquire about the situation back home. Some of the vendors and shopkeepers know Lynn as their regular customer who buys an assortment of goods to resale back home in Harare.\r\n\r\nLynn is a law student at a local University who runs a flea market business in one of the busy suburbs of  Harare. She demonstrates sharp business skills by building a solid relationship with her customers. At times, she imports some products from China and delivers them door to door, in order to know her customers and provide a distinguished service. \r\n\r\nThe 23-year-old woman is a member of Phumulani (which means \u201cRest\u201d in Ndebele, a Zimbabwean dialect). Their focus is to grow their businesses and supply a potentially large market with their products. Lynn hopes that a loan from Kiva will help her import unique products from China, which are in demand and also help their group expand their businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1869843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase her stock of imported clothes and household goods for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-05-18T14:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-17T14:00:05Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lynn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blessing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nabeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esnath","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":208.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":208.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665235575},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":208.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681541971},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":208.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696747227},{"amount":208.01,"local_amount":208.01,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":208.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711678908},{"amount":208.65,"local_amount":208.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":208.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731183036},{"amount":208.35,"local_amount":208.35,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":208.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752271182}],"funded_date":"2015-05-19T17:15:59Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T18:51:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":886228,"name":"Zvart","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zvart lives in Panik village with her 91-years-old and elderly retired father-in-law.

years ago Elizabeth started farming on a small inherited piece of land in Shamatia, a remote village in the Ndaragwa area of Kenya. Today, this humble mother of two children sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. \r\n\r\nAlthough she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding.

Sabina is a hardworking and honest smallholder farmer who hails from the Nkubu area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nFrom the wonderful Kiva lenders she is seeking a loan worth 30,000 KES to buy seedlings and grow her horticulture business. \r\n\r\nHorticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to give Sabina access to a loan that will aid her in growing her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increasing employment opportunities and bringing about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Sabina\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":124.44,"image":{"id":1881304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seedlings and grow her horticulture farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-18T15:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-17T15:50:06Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.34},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.96},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.48,"local_amount":2444.72,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2550.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378729},{"amount":22.32,"local_amount":2060.48,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2149.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588450},{"amount":24.7,"local_amount":2279.76,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2378.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506734},{"amount":50.94,"local_amount":4702.35,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4905.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023555}],"funded_date":"2015-05-19T04:15:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":885219,"name":"Lyh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lyh is 44 years old and married with four children.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

They are all of Miskita ethnicit and are from the city of Bilwi, in the municipality of Puerto Cabezas.  These are enterprising women who struggle each day to grow their small businesses. They sell consumer staples, vegetables, and second-hand clothing.  They formed a communal bank 9 months ago to obtain loans with a group guarantee from Pana Pana.  With their first loan from Pana Pana, financed through Kiva, they were able to increase their inventories.  For example, Reyna Nohemi was able to stock up her business with fruits, vegetables, cheese, curds, and cooked beans.\r\n\r\nCristina is a member of this group, called \"Negociantes.\"  She is a friendly 55 year-old woman who is a single mother with 4 children.  Three of her children are grown, and the youngest is 17 years old but does not study because he has psychomotor problems.

Dorcas is seeking a loan to purchase modern farming implements. She realized that she is working increasingly longer and harder on her farm. The farm work women in the area are currently doing was previously done by males. Women have been forced to take over as their husbands migrate to find wage labor in urban areas. Therefore, the tools women use are of great importance for improving productivity and yields, and reducing time and physical effort. There are health implications as well from using poor traditional tools. The increased income from the use of better tools will help her meet business-related expenses.
