culture. The group is entering its third cycle with Namaste.  These five women have successfully completed two cycles with Namaste during which time they have made much progress and are ready to start a third cycle during which they can grow their businesses even more.  The name of their group comes from the fact that they believe that as long as hope lives in their hearts they will have the strength to do what is necessary to achieve their objectives. One of the women has a small store; one buys and sells firewood; three others sell traditional clothing and various food items.\nDo\u00f1a Olga sells traditional skirts and chocolates on the street.  She is 28 years old with a second grade education.  She is married and has a four-year old daughter.  Her husband has a job and they both contribute to the household. Her long-term dream is to use her profits to have a kitchen in which she can make her chocolates.  She will invest her loan money to buy a supply of blouses and t-shirts, both of which are requested by her clients. She is very grateful to Namaste for what she has learned and the tools she has been given for improving her business.  Namaste provides group classes in financial literacy and a Business Advisor to help her develop and follow a business plan. During the previous two cycles she has attended all the classes and worked diligently with her Business Advisor.\nHer current monthly net profit is 1253 Guatemalan Quetzales working 175 hours.  By the end of this nine-month cycle she hopes to have a net profit of Q2378. To achieve this increase she will be selling the new products she will buy with her loan, up her work hours to 200 each month, and follow the continuing advice of her Business Advisor.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2041.67,"image":{"id":1866510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy a supply of blouses and t-shirts, both of which are requested by her clients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Antonio, Suchitepequez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2015-05-18T21:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-17T21:10:08Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tiburcia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raymunda Catarina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":583.34,"local_amount":4444.44,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4456.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681351667},{"amount":291.67,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2228.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696562056},{"amount":291.67,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2228.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711477246},{"amount":408.35,"local_amount":3111.27,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-26T13:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3120.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730996061},{"amount":466.64,"local_amount":3555.39,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-26T13:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3565.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752084248}],"funded_date":"2015-06-15T01:38:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":883382,"name":"Ana Ruth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana es madre soltera y tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a sus 3 hijos de 12, 17 y 16 a\u00f1os de edad, adem\u00e1s viven con ellos dos t\u00edos.

She has two children, ages 9 and 21.  her business is the sale of cheese.  She is innovative, independent, patient, friendly, responsible and hardworking.  \r\n\r\nHer business developed in Jorochito, characterized by its rolling hills covered by tropical vegetation.  It has rich forestry and wildlife.  There is good agriculture there.  It has a warm tropical climate which is humid.  The temperature is approximately 30 degrees centigrade all year.  \r\n\r\nEloysa has a dark complexion with brown eyes and long black hair which she braids.  She is short with a robust complexion.  Her native tongue is guarani which she speak at home and she also speaks Spanish in public and while working.  (She is standing, far right.) She shares her life with her husband who works in construction.  They live in their own room, made of brick and mortar with a corrugated iron roof.  They have electricity and well water.  \r\n\r\nHer desire to better herself brought her to lead a group of people in various businesses such as:  soft drink sales, tire shop, egg sales, oven sales, fruit sales, diaper sales and pants sales.  They are asking for the loan to better their businesses.  \r\n\r\nHer business is the sale of cheese.  She purchases cheese wholesale from local producers to sell retail, by unit and by weight.  She does this every day of the week, walking and pushing a two wheel card full of cheese and a scale.  \"Cheese is a food that many cannot resist eating.  It is delicious to all ages, it is high in protein, equivalent to meat,\" she comments.  \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is the great demand year round.  The disadvantage is the lack of capital to purchase wholesale.  Her dream is to have a large store where she can sell cheese wholesale.  She hope to be able to purchase a variety of cheeses to increase her offerings and generate better sales.  \r\n\r\nThis is the first sequence of loans for the institution in the year that they have been developing this activity.  For these motives Eloysa is asking for a loan to purchase the varieties of cheese wholesale to increase her sales an open a large store.

Su negocio lo desarrolla en la zona \u2018Pacajes Caluyo\u2019 donde los jueves y domingo desde las 08.00 hasta las 19.00 al menos siete calles son ocupadas por los comerciantes, cerca de 45 asociaciones de comerciantes que cuentan con una autorizaci\u00f3n para vender en las calzadas y aceras. De clima frio y seco con una temperatura que var\u00eda durante el d\u00eda entre -1\/12 grados cent\u00edgrados.\nPacesa es de tez morena, ojos pardos, cabello negro largo lo usa trenzado, baja estatura, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica robusta, su forma de vestir es tradicional (sombrero, manta y pollera), su lengua materna es el Aymar\u00e1 que habla en familia y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y por el negocio que realiza.

Su negocio es la venta de empanadas del tipo \u2018llauchas\u2019; estas empanadas se caracterizan por estar rellenas de una masa gelatinosa a base de queso y se acostumbra a comerlas a primera hora de la ma\u00f1ana y calientes. Son aproximadamente las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana y ella ya se encuentra en la calle empujando su carrito de 2 ruedas donde se encuentran 4 canastas cubiertas y envueltas en papel para que no se enfr\u00ede el contenido que son las llauchas y que los clientes acostumbran a comerlas calientes, llega a su puesto de venta y espera pacientemente a que los clientes lleguen, pocas horas despu\u00e9s se acaba toda su comida. \u201cempec\u00e9 como vendedora, luego aprend\u00ed a hornear la receta y me dedique a vender mi propia producci\u00f3n\u2026\u201d comenta.

Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 21 a\u00f1os que se dedica a esta actividad. \nEs por esos motivos que Pacesa solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de insumos de cocina para la elaboraci\u00f3n de llauchas para abrir una tienda de empanadas.\n","en":"Pacesa is 48 years old, single, with one son aged 12 and one daughter aged 10. Her business is selling empanadas.\n\nShe is a good mother, entrepreneurial, independent, steadfast, patient, responsible, and very hardworking. She does business in the 'Pacajes Caluyo' area, where on Thursday and Sunday from 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM there are at least seven streets filled with vendors, nearly 45 traders associations authourized to sell in the streets and on the sidewalks. The climate is cold and dry, and the temperature varies during the day from -1 to 12 degrees Celsius.\n\nPacesa has a dark complexion and brown eyes. She wears her long black hair in a braid and is of short stature with a robust physique. Her style of dressing is traditional (a hat, shawl, and skirt) and her native language is Aymara, which she speaks with her family. She speaks Spanish in general situations and in her work.  She shares her life with her children, who are in school. They all live in a room that belongs to the family, made of brick and cememnt with a corrugated metal roof, that has drinking water, electricity and sewage disposal. Her business is selling 'llaucha' empanadas; these are empanadas filled with a gelatinous cheese-based mixture, which are normally eaten hot at the beginning of the morning. \n\nAt about 7 in the morning, Pacesa can already be found in the street, pushing her two-wheeled cart. Inside are four baskets, covered and wrapped in paper so that their contents, the llaucha empanadas, won't get cold and the customers can eat them hot. She arrives at her spot and waits patiently for the customers to arrive, and a few short hours later, all of the food has been finished. \"I started as a seller, and later learned to bake the recipe and started selling my own cooking...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she has regular clients who are used to eating her empanadas every day. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy supplies to increase her wares. Her dream is to open a store and sell all kinds of empanadas. She wants to invest in the purchase of cooking supplies like flour, milk, eggs, yeast, cheese, etc. so she can increase her production and reach more clients. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 21 years that she has been doing this work.\n\nThese are the reasons that Pacesa is requesting a loan to buy cooking supplies for making llaucha empanadas in order to open an empanada store."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":442.49,"image":{"id":1872829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cooking supplies for making llaucha empanadas in order to open an empanada store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-05-18T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-17T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pacesa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":384.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":480.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":510.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":508.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":560.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":577.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":590.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":631.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":650.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":678.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":712.51},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":714.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.73},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.41},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.14},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.19},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.33,"local_amount":391.49,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":395.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046675},{"amount":69.32,"local_amount":473.47,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":478.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344501},{"amount":74.79,"local_amount":510.76,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":516.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554713},{"amount":74.35,"local_amount":507.79,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:30Z","rounded_local_amount":513.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468801},{"amount":82.14,"local_amount":560.92,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":566.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296638},{"amount":84.56,"local_amount":577.5,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:02Z","rounded_local_amount":583.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076829}],"funded_date":"2015-05-21T20:12:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Meravi","image":1279777}},{"id":886245,"name":"Gemalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gemalyn is grateful that she was granted a 25000 PHP loan which she used to purchase various grocery items and products needed in her general store.

Jose will invest their loan in raising and fattening lambs; Tomasa and Alejandra will invest in their flower shop, and Alicia will invest in selling footwear. \nAlicia is a person who is very appreciated in her community because of her positive attitude and for being a very hardworking woman, everyone calls her Ali. She has three children with her partner Damian, they are still in school. \nAs an active, enterprising woman, right now she is running three businesses: selling clothing, selling shoes, and a beauty salon. Her daughter helps her with the businesses while she spends most of her time working as a stylist, and in that way she can attend to all of her activities. \nIt was selling footwear that allowed Ali to start the other businesses, and little by little, with her earnings and efforts, she developed her beauty salon. Finally, she was able to take a course in professional styling, which resulted in the beauty salon. \nTo continue moving ahead, Ali would like to invest the loan in footwear, especially boots for the cold season. Her greatest dream is that her children will complete professional degree programs. \n*The photo was taken next to the gazebo in the town square where the four members are from. Ali is wearing a black sweater.

Two of her children are students of a local school. She is a woman of strong determination and perseverance, through which she has achieved success in her small milk selling business. <br \/><br \/>Tultuli's husband, 44-year-old Shiben, is engaged in a spice-selling business. His income is not adequate, so the family survives on Tultuli's small scale business of rearing cows and selling milk. Out of this income, Tultuli spends the lion's share in her family's household expenses compulsorily towards emergencies and her children's education expenses, and can save only a small amount. But the amount is not sufficient to face the growing inflation and to adequately cover the needs of the family. <br \/><br \/>So to improve their financial and living situation, Tultuli wants to increase the earning potential of her milk selling business. She seeks a loan from BJS (a Kiva partner) to buy a new cow, which will allow her to sell more milk and cow dung manure. The loan will help her to take the necessary steps towards ensuring that they can provide well enough for their children's education and better future. Later on she dreams of purchasing more cows.

She chose to study graphic design because she really likes everything having to do with graphic arts.  She is currently in the second semester of her studies.  She still has two years and two months to go in order to finish.  She studies almost 60 hours a week between theory classes and practicums.  Therefore, she is very tired when she gets home.\r\n\r\nUpon finishing her degree, she feels she will benefit financially because she will be working at what she has always liked.  She plans to work for an important graphic company, or perhaps she will set up her own business in order to support her family in this way.\r\n\r\nHer parents work occasionally, which does not allow them to have a fixed income.  This puts the continuation of her studies in jeopardy.  Her sister also works in order to be able to support her family.  However, her income is minimal and only allows them to pay for their necessities.\r\n\r\nThe difficult situation that she is experiencing is what brought her to request an educational loan in order to be able to continue with her education.  That is why she is seeking Kiva\u2019s support so that they will give her the chance to become an excellent graphic designer as she has always dreamed of doing.  She dreams of successfully completing her degree and further specializing in order to work in an efficient way for an important company.\r\n\r\nLastly, Liliana wishes to express the following, \u201cI am very grateful because, thanks to the support that you have given me, I will be able to be a professional and fulfill my dreams.

He has been associated with cultivation for many years. So, he acquired lots of experience in farming. Amina also assists her husband in the field work. Earlier, they used to grow different types of vegetables and crops in different seasons. But now they thought of growing maize on their productive land. <br \/><br \/>Throughout the world, particularly in developing countries, the diet of populations is based on the consumption of a cereal grain, usually maize. These types of basic foods are full of nutrition and also have an international value. So, nowadays maize is very much in demand in markets. <br \/><br \/>So, they want to cultivate maize and sell it directly to the market shops, but because of lack of financial inputs, they cannot start this maize cultivation. For that reason, Amina applied for a loan from Kiva's field partner BJS to buy agricultural supplies such as seeds, manure, pesticides, etc. to cultivate maize. <br \/><br \/>Amina wants to thank BJS and Kiva for their financial support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1882596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy seeds, pesticides, and other agricultural supplies to start maize cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Falakata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2015-05-19T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-18T00:50:04Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-05-19T11:49:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":886491,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn is a married woman with four children.

Her family consists of three members: she and her husband with their only son. Both Prabhati and her husband are illiterate and can sign their names only. They live in Dakshin Parengerpar village in Falakata of West Bengal. Though they could not have the opportunity to receive education, they want to provide quality education to their only son. He is in grade 11 now.<br \/><br \/>At present, Prabhati's husband deals with a cow dung manure business. Cow dung is used as farm manure by the cultivators in their village. He does not have any cows, so he purchases bulk cow dung from village cow owners and then stores the cow dung in a pit in the ground to avoid any damage or loss. Then he supplies this to his customers as per their demand. After managing the household work, Prabhati also assists her husband in this business. <br \/><br \/>According to Prabhati, in the context of the present market situation, the income from the business is hand-to-mouth for her family, so it is very difficult to think of the future development. Although there is a potential market for her husband's business, finance was a hindrance for them. So, she applied for a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) for the development of the business.

He and his wife have raised two children.  Omurbek has a college degree; he is a zootechnician.  His wife works as a librarian.  In order to provide an income for his family, Omurbek is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, having started 20 years ago when he bought his first livestock. Thanks to his very hard work, he now has four horses, six cows and 50 sheep on his farm.  He also grows wheat and clover for resale on four hectares of leased land.  He makes a monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS).  In order to further grow his farming business, he has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 65,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep for fattening.

They are both in their late 40\u2019s and reside in a mountain village with beautiful God-created scenery (fresh air, a river in the middle of the village, lots of wild trees and wild animals as well). There used to be some coal mining long ago under the communist era that at the moment is out of function.  <br \/><br \/>The couple are parents to two boys, 21 and 18 years old and Teuta is the village nurse, whereas Petrit works for a construction company. The house they live in is not theirs but they do not pay rent for it. It is out of shape though. When I, the writer, visited them with the loan officer, I was shocked to see how they lived in it. Too tiny, no amenities, and no kitchen and no washroom either and it seemed that it could collapse anytime.

This can be proved by the quantity of her customers that visit her often at the salon. \r\n\r\nSince she is the only employed person in her family, it is very hard for her to work all day long and cover all the needs alone. This loan she asks as in her workplace she plans to start the sale of cosmetics and perfumes, as an additional source of income. So the loan will be useful for her, as she wants to buy cosmetics and perfumes for sale and also some new equipment for her hairdressing activities.

This charismatic woman has worked in stores and warehouses belonging to her family since she was a child. She has inherited the tradition of this work from them. <br \/><br \/>With some savings she opened her own business in the Nuevo Esperanza seeing that the area had no stores, an opportunity she took advantage of in order to return to this business. Her timetable is from 6 am until 8 pm daily. Her neighbors can buy their food such as rice, oil, eggs, milk powder, flour, pasta, biscuits, canned products, soft drinks, detergent, soap, deodorant, sanitary napkins and other basic household items and she offers them easy payments. She makes her purchases at wholesale warehouses and depots who have confidence in her and she can pay in cash or on credit. <br \/><br \/>At this time she is applying for a loan from Kiva, the first loan she has had from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to stock her business with food like rice, sugar, eggs, milk powder, flour, pasta, biscuits and soft drinks and invest in a cooler.
