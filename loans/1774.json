A family tradition for agriculture - the main source of income and food security for the family - has led Fanta to work in the sector for the last ten years. She grows peanuts on her plot, but as a farmer she has to cope with problems such as a lack of labour.\r\nFanta is into her first season with my Agro, having registered due to the payment system. This year she is making payments to buy a myAgro seed and fertiliser package for growing peanuts, in order to increase the yield on her 625m2 piece of land. Fanta has been growing peanuts for ten years for its crop yield and its marketability.\r\nFanta is planning to be able to trade with her increased yield and higher income. Finally, she hopes to be able to build a home for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1881633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"pour s'offrir un paquet de semences OPV et d'engrais pour la culture d'arachide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sanankorobougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-19T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-18T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Astan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Debi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kounandi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doumbia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":193500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":193500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":193500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":202295.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401619}],"funded_date":"2015-05-19T17:03:30Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alistair Assheton","image":1674519}},{"id":884006,"name":"Neymie Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo solidaria Neymie est\u00e1 integrado por tres mujeres emprendedoras que Solicitan por segundo ciclo el financiamiento en ADIM, el grupo est\u00e1 coordinado por la se\u00f1ora Mariela de 33 a\u00f1os de edad, casada y madre de tres hijos, por los que trabaja d\u00eda a d\u00eda para darles un futuro mejor, se dedica a la venta de ropa y joyer\u00eda de plata desde hace ocho a\u00f1os, con el cr\u00e9dito anterior logro mejorar su casa, una de sus metas es aumentar el negocio, por lo que solicita el cr\u00e9dito para la compra de Blusas, pantalones, chores y faldas, la segunda socia es paulina de 32 a\u00f1os de edad propietaria de una pulper\u00eda en su domicilio y la tercer socia es do\u00f1a Quinnette de 36 a\u00f1os de edad quien se dedica a la venta de ropa nueva desde hace cinco a\u00f1os.","en":"The solidarity group Neymie is integrated by 3 entrepreneurial women who are requesting a second financing cycle in ADIM.

Anna and her family have suffered many setbacks related to health issues which resulted in financial distress for the family.  A few years ago, Anna underwent a surgery that did not go as planned and she was ultimately left with chronic pain that she will have to endure for the rest of her life. That same year, Anna had another life-threatening condition that left her in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for days. Through these difficult times, Anna was resilient and kept a positive attitude during her recovery; however, her husband who had been her emotional and financial support also became critically ill shortly after she was released from the hospital. These series of events caused severe financial damage and called for sacrifices, which include giving up the family car to be able to pay for their living expenses. Despite a turbulent time, the family has worked hard to recover from these setbacks, and they have paid off much of the medical debt incurred during the time of Anna and her husband\u2019s illnesses. Anna was inspired by her son to pursue her dream of helping special needs children obtain assistance through a non-profit program she created. She hopes to one day open a school for special needs children so that they will be able to receive care and education tailored to their needs. \n\nDue to her multiple medical issues, Anna\u2019s credit has been damaged, and this is preventing her from obtaining financing.  Their current air conditioner contains mold and is malfunctioning.

Sadly, Ernestine\u2019s husband lost his life while serving our country twenty nine years ago. This has greatly affected Ernestine as well as her children who were forced to grow up without their father. Over the years, as a single mother, Ernestine has raised and set a positive example for their children through her determination and strength. Ernestine has always managed to run her household smoothly, but she has recently experienced a few unforeseen setbacks. When Ernestine\u2019s mother passed away, Ernestine had to use every penny she had saved in order to pay for her final expenses. Ernestine was able to recover from this setback, but two months ago Ernestine\u2019s daughter was forced to move back home due to a disability. Ernestine\u2019s limited credit history has hindered her from being able to make repairs to her home, and she is currently in desperate need of a new air conditioner to replace her broken unit. Ernestine wishes to make her home more comfortable and healthy for her disabled daughter and the rest of her children as the summer heat has arrived. She does not want her children to suffer through Florida\u2019s hot summer months without a working air conditioner. Not only will Ernestine and her children improve the livability of their home by installing a high efficiency air conditioner, but Ernestine will also build a positive credit history as she repays her

He speaks with an even tone, which is impressive, and he easily wins the trust of others. \r\n\r\nDue to his behavior and tone, he has built up very good relations with his customers. His general store is very famous in the town, and that is the reason his business runs well. Due to good relations his sales have increased a lot, but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand. Therefore, Farzana has requested a loan for her husband, so that he can buy more stock of wheat, rice, flour, pulses, soaps, shampoo, detergents, biscuits etc. \r\n\r\nFrazana hopes that her husband will utilize the loan in a positive way.

Victor is tan, has short black hair, and black eyes, is short and skinny.  His native tongue is Aymar\u00e1, which is spoken where he is from, but he also speaks Spanish in public and for business.  He lives with his family who works in agriculture. They live in a house that they own built of adobe with a corrugated roof, which has electricity and well water.\r\n\r\nHe has a business raising dairy cows to make milk and cheese. He spends his time visiting livestock fairs and purchasing dairy cows. \"My primary job is making and selling cheese as well as running a neighborhood store.\" The advantage of his business is that he is able to work in both activities, the downside is the weather as in some seasons the grain harvests are scarce. \r\n\r\nThe reason why he is seeking this loan is because of the low milk production during the winter, which reduces his cheese production and his income. His dream is to have a large cheese factory with many varieties of cheese. He hopes to expand his business by purchasing a dairy cow to produce artisanal cheeses, and by purchasing groceries for his neighborhood store.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with the institution in the 30 years that he has worked in this business.

More than 1,000 people gather to enjoy it. At the heart of this village, the group El Rosario was formed. It was named in honor of one of the members.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group have different activities: Eunice and Juana sell shoes on a catalogue, Olga sells traditional snacks, Maria del Rosario sells honey and handbags, Blanca sells cosmetics, and Elia sells clothes. Also, Antonieta is the manager of a nutrition club and Eustorgia is the manager of a small restaurant.\r\n\r\nEustorgia Margarita is better known as Mago. She is a single mother of four children, all of them adults. Her children were her main motivation to open the restaurant. \u201cIt is not easy to have four children and not find a job. They are the reason why I started this business.\u201d In the beginning, it was difficult for her to start this business, since there was a lot of competition. However, after twenty years, hers is the last tavern still open.\r\n\r\nMago opens her small restaurant Monday to Sunday, from 09:00 am until 10:00 pm. She sells, among other things, complete meals, snacks, juices, smoothies and water flavored with natural fruits. She is kind to the clients and her food is delicious; these are the reasons why her business continues to be successful. With the profits she has made, Mago has been able to get ahead with her family. Now that her children help her economically, she continues working, since having her own business makes her feel free and economically independent.\r\n\r\nThis time, Mago has requested a loan to buy sandals and shoes to start a new business and make better use of some empty space she has in her restaurant. Mago is planning to run these two businesses without slowing down the pace. With a smile on her face, Mago says: \u201cThank you for believing in us and for giving us the possibility of receiving a loan to continue with our activities.\u201d\r\n\r\n* This picture was taken in Mago\u2019s restaurant.

She has four children and lives in a neighbourhood of the municipality of Gracias, Lempira.  She has cultivated corn, beans, and coffee for 16 years. Her coffee crop generates the greatest income. She sells it in grain form. It is depulped and dried in the zone where she lives. She has decided to request a new loan of 6,000 lempiras in a group. She will invest this loan in the payment of labourers and the purchase of manure to fertilize her coffee farm. This will improve production. Her plan is to have a good family patrimony so that they can live well and she will grow as a coffee producer.\nHer group is called Rancho Grande. It is made up of three women who work in agriculture, cultivating coffee, corn, and beans. They live in the same community.

","en":"In the regions and villages of the Republic of Tajikistand, the main type of business is livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. There are no factories and few means of transport in the regions. There are lots of plants, trees, fresh air and great weather for agriculture. \r\n\r\nParvina is from the Gissar region. She is 19 years old and married. She does not yet have children. Parvina works with field crop cultivation in the region. She is young; however she is talented and hardworking. \r\n\r\nThis year Parvina sowed onions. She is happy when she can get a rich and high quality harvest. Parvina would like people to eat healthy and high quality crop. Mineral fertilizers help get a healthy and high quality harvest. \r\n\r\nParvina decided to process the land with mineral fertilizers.

She will also use the banana leaves in feeding her animals, which will result in increased milk production. \r\n\r\nThe money will help her manage to pay the high costs of inputs that have given her sleepless nights in the past.

Her husband is a turner by profession. He works over a lathe machine and manufactures and renews the spare parts of vehicles such as motorbikes, motor cars and auto rickshaws. He renews the interior parts of vehicle engines, such as renewing the turbine and radiators. He has been doing this business for many years and up to now his business has been very steady. Due to continuously working on the lathe machine, some important parts have been tearing off and urgently need to be replaced. Without the replacement of parts, the whole mechanism of the lathe machine is negatively affected.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a poor person and does not have sufficient cash in hand to buy spare parts to fix the lathe machine or buy cutting tools. Therefore, Shazia has requested a loan for her husband so that he can fix the lathe machine and buy cutting tools to work over the lathe machine. Shazia hopes that this loan will prove productive for the business as well as for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":315.4,"image":{"id":1883960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machine

Then they thought the agricultural sector could be the best way to contribute to the development of a country, and particularly to the community of Acul-du-Nord. Through their dynamism, they have a contract to deliver seedlings to USAID, in the AVANSE program. The business has now hires three employees.\r\n\r\nTheir goal is to produce nurseries in order to facilitate farmers and people in the community to continue with planting activities.

Her native language is Aymar\u00e1 which is spoken in the area, and she speaks Spanish as general culture and in her job. She shares her life with her son, who attends school. They live in their own house, built with brick and cement, with corrugated iron roof, drinking water, electricity and sewerage. Her business is making weaved fabrics in alpaca and vicuna, a job she does with her son. She takes care of the weaving which consists of converting the pieces of fabric from wool into thread in a craftmanship way. Her son helps with the weaving because it is a simpler job. \u201cI started my business when I was very young by selling wool and helping other people with fabrics. My first weaving were 2 blankets. I sold them and started to increase my capital until I had my set customers...\", she comments. The advantage of her business is that her son helps her with hand labor; the disadvantage is the lack of money to buy wool. Her dream is to have a bigger workshop and to export her fabrics. She wants to buy alpaca and vicuna wool at wholesale prices. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 20 years she has been working in this job. These are the reasons why Martha is requesting a loan to buy various types of wool at wholesale prices in order to open a bigger workshop and export her fabrics.

This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 17 years she is working in this job.

He lives with his parents and pensioner grandmother. The family members earn a living with a  small agribusiness. Particularly, they are engaged in pig breeding, in cultivating agricultural land and harvesting nuts. They get a small income from selling agricultural products at the local market. For increasing the family's living condition and more effectively meet the daily costs, Zurab decided to start dairy farming. \r\n\r\nHe wants to purchase cattle and requested a loan among local financial institutions. His loan request was approved in the frame of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start up credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. The family members will raise them and, after 12 months, will start milking. They will start production of cheese and yogurt for selling and for family-use also.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the new business initiative, implemented with the assistance of Kiva, the family's income will significantly increase and Zurab will make his bit to the family's welfare.

a 40 year-old married woman, lives in village Dzveli Abasha. She has a husband, three children and a pensioner grandmother. The family has very poor living conditions, as they don't have any source of significant income for financial stability. They require financial support to get rid of poverty and live in a normal condition. Gulnazi and her husband get income from a small agricultural activity. They take care of pigs and chickens and sell them locally. However the income is really small for a 6-member family to cover even basic needs. She wants to purchase cattle and has requested a loan among local financial institutions. \r\n\r\nHer loan request was approved in the frames of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-ups and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers,\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nGulnazi will place the purchased calves in an old cattle-shed located in the family yard. She will raise them, and after 12 months, will start milking them. Gulnazi will start production of cheese and she will sell it at the open market. As a result of the new business initiative, implemented with the assistance of Kiva, the family's income will significantly increase and they will live in better conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":106.69,"image":{"id":1884168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle and start dairy-farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Dzveli Abasha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2015-05-20T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-19T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnazi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":24,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":38.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":41.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":41.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":42.91},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":45.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":45.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":48.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":49.02},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":54},{"due_date":"2016-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2016-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":56.68},{"due_date":"2016-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":57.87},{"due_date":"2016-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":60.39},{"due_date":"2016-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":61.83},{"due_date":"2016-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63.9},{"due_date":"2016-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":66.42},{"due_date":"2016-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":68.26},{"due_date":"2016-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":70.78},{"due_date":"2017-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2017-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.16},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.07},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.45},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.16},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.62},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.69},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.8},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.32},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.42},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.05},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.96},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.06},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.86},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.97},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.9},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.79,"local_amount":72.66,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":74.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681391135},{"amount":18.09,"local_amount":41.35,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:06:04Z","rounded_local_amount":42.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696601433},{"amount":18.16,"local_amount":41.52,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":42.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711520776},{"amount":18.77,"local_amount":42.91,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":44.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731036594},{"amount":19.88,"local_amount":45.43,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:56:13Z","rounded_local_amount":46.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752125441}],"funded_date":"2015-06-09T07:28:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":884086,"name":"Gerson Efrain","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gerson es un joven de 22 a\u00f1os, naci\u00f3 en La Paz \u2013 Bolivia, por motivos familiares recientes decidi\u00f3 irse a vivir a la ciudad de Cochabamba.

Assitan is a 65-year-old mother to two children, aged 35 and 42 years old, neither of whom are currently receiving an education. Adherence to the family farming tradition, which is her main source of revenue and food sufficiency, is what pushed Assitan to carry out this activity for the past 50 years. She grows peanuts, corn, millet, rice and vegetables on her plot of land, but she must face up to many difficulties, such as a lack of rainfall, farming equipment and quality fertiliser. Assitan is starting her first year with myAgro. She signed up in order to increase her crop yield through the services offered by myAgro. This year, Assitan has taken out a loan in order to purchase a packet of myAgro OPV seeds and fertiliser for growing peanuts in order to increase her crop yield over her 0.0625-hectare plot. Assitan has been growing peanuts for 50 years due to its value as a daily foodstuff, as it can be directly eaten by the family and is used as a base sauce for many dishes. It also brings in a good price at market. With the increase in her yield and her revenue, Assitan plans to start raising livestock and going into retail. She also hopes to be able to ensure her family's food sufficiency.

The area has a hot and very humid tropical climate, with a temperature that varies throughout the day between 18-35 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nLeidy is dark-sinned, with brown eyes, long black hair that she ties back, short stature, and thin physique. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed that she speaks with family and she speaks Spanish in general settings and for her business (she is sitting to the right holding a backpack and with her son, dressed in a white shirt and blue pants). She shares her life with her husband, who works as a constructor, and with her children who are not yet old enough for school. They live in their own room built from bricks and cement, with a tin roof and which has drinking water, electricity and sewerage. \r\n\r\nHer desire to excel led her to form a group of people with businesses such as: an auto shop, selling second-hand clothing, selling natural health products, air conditioner repair, selling fruit, selling food and selling imitation jewelry, in order to ask for a loan and improve their businesses. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling empanadas and pacumutos (kebabs). The empanada is a ball of bread, stuffed with a mixture called \"jigote\", and baked or fried. The stuffing can include red or white meats and vegetables. The pacumutu is a food that consists of various types of meats interlaced with vegetables, cut into cubs and skewered on a wooden stick or wire to roast on coals or on the grill. Both foods are very traditional. \"I started my business because of the need to work and take care of my children. Little by little the earnings improve and the business needs to grow...\" she says. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that the sales are reliable and daily. The disadvantage is the lack of work materials such as a grill and other utensils. Her dream is to open a restaurant of traditional foods. She wants to extend her business through buying a grill to increase her menu and improve her sales. This is the 1st sequence of loans with the institution in 4 years that she has been working this business. It is for those reasons that Leidy is asking for a loan to buy a grill to open a stall selling traditional food.

She started baking for family and friends, and then word spread and she began to get requests for paid orders. From there, her business took off. Through word of mouth, repeat customers, and social networking, she has created a successful startup business. <br \/><br \/>Now, at 20 years old, Jessica wants to move her business to a storefront in Belmar, NJ: JB Couture Cupcakes. She hopes that a storefront will allow her to more easily cater to her loyal customer base, while being more accessible to the local residents of Monmouth County. <br \/><br \/>She has a strong backing of community support. She held a successful Kickstarter campaign, which raised $5,840, and has had multiple commercial kitchen appliances donated to her from community members as well. This loan of $1,150 will be used to purchase the remaining equipment she needs for her new storefront.<br \/><br \/>From Jessica: \"I plan for JB Couture Cupcakes to be an interactive cupcake experience where the customer will create their own cupcake. A menu will list the type of cupcake, buttercream, filling, toppings, and sprinkles that the customer will be able to choose. Once the customer picks the flavors and toppings they crave, I will create the cupcake before their eyes. I will also have a seating area and benches so the customers can enjoy their cupcakes in style just steps away from the beach.
