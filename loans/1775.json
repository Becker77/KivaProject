For that she needs some capital. Ajitan has taken a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BJS to purchase more wood in bulk to be able to supply more.

Su sue\u00f1o es terminar de construir su casa. \u00c9l desea realizar la conexi\u00f3n de agua potable para su ba\u00f1o, cocina y lavander\u00eda; y dejar de usar su pozo, para brindarle a su familia mayor comodidad y mejores condiciones de salud. Esta es la 2 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 3 a\u00f1os que est\u00e1 construyendo su casa.\nEs por esos motivos que Ismael solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la conexi\u00f3n de agua potable en su cocina, ba\u00f1o y lavander\u00eda para brindarle a su familia mejores condiciones de salud.\n","en":"Ismael, 24, lives with his spouse, doesn\u2019t have children, and works as a driver.\r\nHe is business-minded, dedicated to his work, affable, ready to help, responsible and very hard-working. He works in Sacaba, a rural area in the high valleys, where the climate is sunny and warm, some 13 kilometres from the city.\r\nIsmael has brown skin, brown eyes, a short stature, short black hair, and is of medium build. His mother tongue is Quechua, which is spoken locally; he learned Spanish by hearing people speak it and by speaking with his customers. He shares his life with his partner, who sells food. They live in a house made of brick and cement that is not quite finished yet. They have electricity and well water, the latter extracted with a pump. Ismael is a taxi driver. He lives in a rural area close to the city. People in this locality have wells and they used to get fresh water from the river as well. However, the water from the river is not fit for human consumption anymore, so the people have been relying exclusively on wells for years. Ismael wants to connect to the city's water grid so as to improve sanitary conditions at his house. Though Ismael's house is located conveniently closed to recently-built municipal water pipes, he lacks the funds needed to connect to the grid. His dream is to finish building his house. He wants to have running potable water in the bathroom, in the kitchen, and in the washroom. He longs to be rid of the well so that his family can enjoy modern amenities and a better standard of living. Ismael has been building his house for three years and this is his second loan with the field partner.\r\nThus, Ismael asks for a loan to have running potable water in the kitchen, in the bathroom, and in the washroom. His goal is to provide his family with healthier living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1880720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She has two children, ages 2 and 4, and works as a hairdresser and manicurist.  She is a good mother and an enterprising, optimistic, generous, friendly, responsible and very hardworking woman. Her business is in the \u201cMutualista\u201d area, which is the region with the highest rate of economic growth in the past few years, mainly respresented by its agricultural and forestry production.\r\n\r\nBeing from a subtropical climate, with a temperature that varies daily between 21-35\u00baC (70-95\u00baF), Damari is dark skinned, has brown eyes and long black hair which she wears tied back. She is short and of average build. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks among family. She has a general knowledge of Spanish and uses it in her business. (In the photo, she is the second from the right, wearing a grey shirt, white pants, and carrying a brown purse.)\r\n\r\nShe lives her life together with her life partner who works as a vendor, and with their two children who are not yet of school age. They live in their own room made of brick and cement, with a sheet metal roof and a cement floor. The room has potable water, electricity, and is connected to the sewage system. \r\n\r\nHer dreams of overcoming her hardships led her to lead a bank of people whose businesses include: flower sales, turnover pastry sales, sheet-making, feminine accessory sales, food sales, meat and chicken sales, and a bakery. The group requests loans to improve their businesses. \r\nShe is employed as a hairdresser and manicurist in a beauty salon. Her schedule is from 9 in the morning till 5 in the afternoon from Tuesday to Sunday. She states that she started her job as an assistant and later become a hairdresser and then a manicurist.  The advantage of her job is that she has knowledge of the business, but the disadvantage is the lack of money to become independent and open her own beauty salon. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to open her own business, for which she wants to purchase furniture and hairdressing equipment. This is the first loan cycle with the financial institution in the two years she has been working in the salon. It is for this reason that Damari is requesting a loan to purchase hairdressing equipment to become independent and open her own business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3714.78,"image":{"id":1880751,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

He has therefore decided to buy his own vehicle and transport his own clients. \r\n\r\nWith this goal in mind, Elguja requested a loan from local financial institutions. After several unsuccessful attempts to receive credit, he applied to MFO Credo, which has a joint initiative with Kiva. They offer a start-up loan program that offers a chance to people who don't have access to local credit products for starting or restarting businesses. \r\n\r\nWith his loan funds, Elguja will purchase a second-hand minibus and will start his own enterprise as a bus driver. He will have regular customers and expects a significant increase in his income. \r\n\r\nElguja relies on the goodwill of his Kiva lenders, and he highly appreciates your support.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

One member resigned from the membership and decided to continue to manage the pigs business with her own money. She had enough profit from the last loan. She was replaced by a new member. Having been successful with maintaining and fattening piglets, Ketut used this period of the loan to purchase four types of local pigs and they will be maintained for 2 months.

Ida Ayu, the leader of the group, purchased superior feed for her pigs with her loan funds, and she sold all her pigs at a profit to a major buyer. She now has two more sows. With her profits, and with the help of this new loan from MUK, she plans to purchase local piglets and feed. With the overall increase in household income, she has better supported the daily needs of her family, and she has started a savings fund for her family's use in the case of emergencies. \r\n\r\nThe Sinar Dewi group applied for a second loan, with five members receiving a total loan of 5,000 IDR. Having been successful with her pig business, Ida Ayu will be using most of her portion of the loan to purchase four types of local pigs to raise for two months before making a profit by preparing and selling pork barbeque. The remainder of the loan will be used to buy feed for her pigs. The price of pig feed is currently very expensive, but she remains optimistic about her business going forward. With the increased profits she expects as a result of her loan investment, she plans to make essential repairs and renovations to her home.

Together, the family can earn around $28 per day. \r\n\r\nSon would like to build a house for his married daughter but he doesn\u2019t have enough money to buy lumber and zinc sheets, so he takes out a loan.

They are studying in school. Her husband is an entrepreneur from a farming family and is involved in agriculture. They live their own kaccha house (straw and mud-made house) in a small village called Dalimpur in the district of Alipurduar.\r\n\r\nDolo works hard every day, from the early morning. Their main activity and source of income is in the planting and cultivation of paddy rice. One of the challenges they come across in the maintenance and support of their crops is the high prices of the farm inputs. Because those items are expensive, the income with which she is left is sometimes too low to help as it should.

When a customer orders, Eli will submit the order via SMS and, within 5-10 days, the product will be delivered to the customer. With Mapan, Eli believes that her community will be able to have access to higher quality products with better prices. \r\n\r\nAs seen in the photo, Eli is the one who is standing in her own stall.

She has running water, electricity and a sewer system.  \r\n\r\nShe works extracting stones from the river to be used for construction.  This material is used for coating, delineating roads, terraces, corridors, fountains, waterfalls, and to cover trees. She extracts these stones by hand. She states \"I learned this trade from my parents who work extracting sand. I got to know their clients and I branched out on my own.\" The upside of her business is that her customers are regular. The downside is a lack of money to repair her machinery. Her dream is to purchase a sand truck. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to repair the motor of her sand washing machine in order to continue working.

She adapted some space where she exhibits the merchandise, blouses, jeans and skirts, in showcases and mannequins. She sells these among her neighbors and friends, whom she offers at affordable prices and facilities in payment. She buys in the city of Medell\u00edn in the department of Antioquia. It is called the fashion capital for being one of the cities that promotes the most the textile and sewing business in Colombia, and she has been able to enjoy a novel and fashionable assortment which promotes sales. Currently, she is requesting a credikiva, the first loan she does to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to invest in pants and blouses of the new collection. Wuendy has progress goals, among them to buy a house and her own store. Her main challenge is to give her customers more clothes on credit in order to increase her earnings.

She is happily married, and together with her handsome husband, they are blessed with a lovely family. For the past 25 years Jane has been involved in mixed farming. Jane has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good-quality dairy cow. \r\n\r\nDairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices have been going up in the recent past, so Jane, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she knows that she will get not only milk from the cow but also manure, and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling her milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also be selling to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nJane said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural-based loans, and their interest rate is both low and on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Jane hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to add value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products.

She is happily married to Protasio, who adds additional income to support their family. They are blessed with one lovely child. \r\n\r\nRael is a mother dedicated to her work. At age 30, she spends every day of the week, Monday through Sunday, on her mixed farm, working tirelessly. Rael is one of the most hardworking and dedicated women on Planet Earth. \r\n\r\nFor the past six years she has been engaged in mixed farming, and through selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops she has earned a decent income. Like many farmers in her village, she also plants trees on her farm to complement the region's natural forests. \r\n\r\nAlthough Rael makes profits selling her farm produce at the market, the biggest challenge she faces is lack of water to irrigate her farm and water for home consumption. Rael comes from an area where there is no water connection and she is always forced to walk for a long distance for this \u201cprecious commodity.\" Rael faces challenges carrying water on her back because of her failing health. \r\n\r\nRael is seeking a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the farmers in Kenya depend on rain-fed agriculture but Rael wants to change that notion and start irrigation farming. Through the loan, she intends to harvest rain water (which always goes to waste) and store it in the tank. She intends to buy pipes that will be used to pump water from the river directly to her farm. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Rael will be saved the trouble of walking a long distance in search of water, and she will have enough water for home consumption. Irrigating her farm will boost productivity since water is an important requirement in the germination of crops. Rael is very excited about this project and hopes her dream will be achieved through the loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders. Increased productivity means increased income and this will translate to improved living standards. \r\n\r\nShe will use the additional income to improve and secure the future of her children. Rael\u2019s hope for the future is to live a fulfilling

She is 25 years old with four young children. Her eldest is six and her youngest is only six months. \r\n\r\nMary Joy works hard on her farm even while looking after the needs of her small children. Her farming business started five years ago.

He has a property in which he grows coffee and basic grains.  In his community there's no electricity so in the coffee picking season they wake up very early to make the food for the pickers and they have to use lanterns and flashlights to be able to see and at night while they are taking out the coffee pulp it's the same situation as well as when he has to go take care of his kid at night.  \r\nThis is why he's requesting a loan to buy a solar energy system so that they can work and take care of their daily chores more comfortably.  Luis mentions that he's been able to buy his things with a lot of effort and the solar panel will be another one of those articles that will be of great help for his home and for work.

His parents decided it was very dangerous so they stopped sending him to school. Instead he started work in the fields with his father. Nowadays he and his siblings work the land that was left to them by their father. They grow coffee, cocoa, and basic grains.\r\n\r\nVicente notes that it was his parents who taught him to be a good, hardworking and honest person. He works well with his neighbors and the organizations who visit the area. \r\n\r\nIn his community there is no electricity so Vicente is seeking a loan to buy a solar system. It would bring many benefits to all members of the household; he has nieces and nephews who attend school and need light at night so they can do their homework. As well, during the coffee harvest the family has to get up early and make food for the workers. At the moment they use candles and flashlights when they have to work in the dark extracting the beans.

In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. \r\n\r\nThe main challenge that Joyce faces is that her cows stray to her neighbour's compound.

Su negocio lo realiza en la localidad \u2018El Torno\u2019 caracterizado por el comercio de productos agr\u00edcolas como, frutas, verduras, carne, etc., al por mayor y en grandes cantidades, donde acuden los distribuidores mayoristas a comprar por camionada las frutas y verduras que despu\u00e9s repartir\u00e1n por toda la ciudad. De clima sub tropical con una temperatura que var\u00eda durante el d\u00eda entre 21-35 grados centigrados.\nSonia es de tez morena, ojos pardos, cabello negro largo lo usa amarrado por detr\u00e1s, baja estatura, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica delgada, su lengua materna es el guaran\u00ed que se habla en el lugar y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y debido al comercio en la ciudad (al centro, viste calza roja y blusa azul). Su vida la realiza junto a su pareja que trabaja en agricultura y con sus hijos; el mayor estudia en la escuela, los 3 menores a\u00fan no se encuentran ene dad escolar. Viven en una casa propia construida de ladrillo y cemento con techo de calamina y piso de tierra que cuenta con energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y agua de pozo no cuenta con alcantarillado. La necesidad por ampliar su negocio la llev\u00f3 a formar una banca de personas con negocios como; venta de refrescos hervidos, venta de helados artesanales, venta de pollo frito, preparaci\u00f3n de tierra para la siembra, venta de yuca, comercio de semillas y venta de alimento para animales de granja, para solicita un pr\u00e9stamo y mejorar sus actividades. Su negocio es la venta de frutas de temporada por mayor, los productores del campo llegan hasta su lugar de venta a entregarle grandes cantidades de frutas que ella almacena y vende al por mayor. \u201cinici\u00e9 mi negocio vendiendo mi propia producci\u00f3n, luego me hicieron pedidos y el negocio se fue estabilizando\u2026\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que la venta es por mayor, la desventaja es la falta de dinero para aumentar la oferta. Su sue\u00f1o es ampliar su negocio elaborando \u2018mermeladas de papaya\u2019, ella piensa que ser\u00e1 un negocio pr\u00f3spero porque sus clientes le exigen el producto y antes de producir ya cuenta con varios pedidos. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 2 a\u00f1os que desarrolla esta actividad. \nEs por esos motivos que Sonia solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la fabricaci\u00f3n de mermelada de papaya para incursionar en el rubro y cumplir con los pedidos pendientes.\n","en":"Sonia is 30 years old and lives with her partner and four children, ages 3, 5, 7 and 7-months.  Her business is selling fruit wholesale.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, enterprising, independent, consistent, determined, responsible and very hard-working.  Her business is set up in \"El Torno\" which is known for its commerce of farm products such as fruit, vegetables, meet, etc. wholesale and in bulk.  Wholesale dealers buy fruit and vegetables by the truck-load which they deliver throughout the entire city.  The climate is sub-tropical with an average temperature of between 21-35 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nSonia has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair which she wears tied back, is short in height and has a slim physique.  Her mother tongue is Guarani which she speaks locally and she speaks Spanish for general purposes and because of the commerce in the city.  (She is the one in the middle wearing red pants and a blue blouse).  She lives with her partner who works in agriculture and their children.  The eldest attends school and the youngest three are not old enough yet.  They live in their own brick and concrete house which has a metal sheeting roof and dirt floor.  It has electricity and well water, but there is no sewage system.\r\n\r\nThe need to expand her business is what motivated her to set up a bank group that includes activities such as soft drink sales, artisan ice creams, fried chicken, land preparation for planting, yucca sales, seed sales and animal feed sales to request a loan and improve members' businesses.\r\n\r\nSonia's business is selling seasonal fruit wholesale.  Farmers deliver large quantities of fruit to her which she stores and sells wholesale.  \"I started out selling my own production and then I took orders and the business started stabilizing...\" she says.  The advantage of her business is that she sells wholesale.  The disadvantage is the lack of money to increase her stock.  Her dream is to grow her business by making \"papaya jam\".  She believes it would be a good business because there is a high demand for the product, so she already has several orders.  This is her first loan through the institution in the two years she has been in business.  Sonia is requesting the loan to get started in the papapa jam business and fill pending orders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4981.11,"image":{"id":1880909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To make papaya jam to fill pending orders.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-05-21T08:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-20T08:00:02Z","loan_amount":5800,"lender_count":153,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Venancia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Romulo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oshin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elismar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":5800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4397.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4557.18},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4723.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4894.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5073.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5257.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5449.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5647.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":660.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":684.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":709.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":735.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":790.14},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":818.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1298.37,"local_amount":8954.3,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":8971.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344540},{"amount":684.84,"local_amount":4723.05,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4732.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554751},{"amount":709.77,"local_amount":4894.98,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4904.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468836},{"amount":1497.99,"local_amount":10330.97,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":10350.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296669},{"amount":790.14,"local_amount":5449.2,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:14Z","rounded_local_amount":5459.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076847}],"funded_date":"2015-06-17T15:15:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":887700,"name":"Edna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edna is a businesswoman and proud mother to her children who are now entering college.

Each Tajik household has a traditional [clay] oven known as \u201ctandyr.\u201d Women bake aromatic flatbread for their families using a traditional national recipe. The aroma of a freshly baked flatbread is mouth-watering. In families with small children, special small flatbread is baked. Children are expected to eat this special bread, which, according to tradition, brings good luck for their future.  Tajik people value every crumb of bread. Our Lyuba also used to help her mother bake flat bread as a child. Her mother taught her baking. When Lyuba was young she enjoyed baking small flatbeads for herself and her brothers and worked hard at it. \r\n\r\nAfter getting married, Lyuba decided to help contribute to the household budget, and started baking flatbread.
