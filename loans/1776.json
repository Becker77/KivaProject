To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Bomet area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and that she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going child."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":84.41,"image":{"id":1885239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry to meet local demand and improve her living conditions","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bomet","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-21T14:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-20T14:50:05Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.58,"local_amount":1473.95,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1595.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378743},{"amount":15.39,"local_amount":1368.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1480.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588462},{"amount":17.61,"local_amount":1565.42,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1694.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506750},{"amount":16.69,"local_amount":1483.56,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1605.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023568},{"amount":18.14,"local_amount":1611.96,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1744.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111722}],"funded_date":"2015-05-23T13:02:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":887771,"name":"Alaa' Al-Deen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alaa' Al-Deen is a 20-year-old single man from Nablus City.

Meet Josephine, a 45-year-old mother who is so humble, honest and a very hardworking mother on this planet Earth. Josephine really adores her family and will always do anything good so that they never go to bed with hungry stomachs. Josephine hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya. Josephine never got the opportunity to advance her education and get a white collar job but this did not kill her dream of wanting to succeed in life. Josephine started farming and has been doing farming for the past six years. Throughout those years, she has gathered so much experience and all the farming techniques are at her fingertips. \r\n\r\nJosephine practices mixed farming on her farm and through the profits.  She has managed to take care of her family's needs and give her children a good education because she believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success\u201d. Josephine is a mother who is very enterprising. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan of KES 50,000 to start horticulture farming on her farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, Josephine wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits. Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva to help aspiring women like Josephine to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. \r\n\r\nJosephine hopes that through the loan, she will improve her living conditions. Josephine's dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year, she will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. Through this, she will be able to assure her children a secure future and uninterrupted learning because she will be able to pay tuition fees on time. Josephine is not a selfish woman and will also want to impact positively on society. That is why she will employ people to work for her on her horticulture farm, thus having an impact on society."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":177.43,"image":{"id":1885273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming which will create jobs locally","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-21T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-20T15:20:04Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.17},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.46},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.78},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.15},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.56},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":177.43,"local_amount":16897.94,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":17067.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588464}],"funded_date":"2015-05-27T14:34:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":884921,"name":"El Eucalipto Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201c El Eucalipto\u201d, conformado por 2 mujeres y 1 var\u00f3n dedicados a diferentes negocios, pero con una sola raz\u00f3n, seguir creciendo y ayudando a sus familias.

She lives in a rural area. Saodat has reared animals ever since her childhood. Thanks to this business she was able to pay for her studies and get a higher education. Now Saodat works as an accountant in an organisation, but she never gave up her own business and continues to expand it. Indeed her business is her main source of income. At the present time Saodat has decided to renovate her house and insulate it. But because of the renovation work she does not have sufficient money to insulate the house and so she has decided to apply to Arvand with this problem for support. She wants to buy and install vinyl windows and insulate the walls and ceiling with the money."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1886237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to insulate her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

Bashorat graduated from university, but for the first ten years she was unable to work because she was raising small children. Now Bashorat works in a Civil Registry Office. She has a small salary, so she also works at home as a seamstress. Her husband is a taxi driver. Bashorat understands that working and earning money is very difficult at the present time. She wants to provide a bright future for her children. Bashorat has applied to MDO Arvand to get a loan to buy vinyl doors to insulate her house. The winter this year was very cold. Because of this almost all the family was ill all winter. So Bashorat decided to buy vinyl windows and doors to protect her family from the cold. But she does not have all the money for this. Bashorat hopes that MDO Arvand will support her and provide the required sum.

She is 28 years old. She studied well in school. After finishing school she enrolled in a teacher training college. She studied there for three years but she did not complete her higher education. Shahnoza got married and gave birth to two children. She is a caring mother and wife. Shahnoza's husband works as a carpenter. He supports the family on his own, but his salary cannot completely provide for all of the family's expenses. Shahnoza would like to get a job in order to help her husband, but unfortunately she has not found a well-paying job because she has an incomplete education. She has decided to continue her university studies and now she is studying in her final year. Since Shahnoza wants to expand her horizons further she can learn a lot through the Internet. She needs a notebook computer to do this, so she has had to apply to MDO Arvand for a loan. She expresses her gratitude to MDO Arvand for its support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.59,"image":{"id":1880446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to buy a notebook computer to help her study.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-05-21T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-20T17:30:03Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shahnoza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":45.26},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":45.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":45.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":47.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":47.82},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":51.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":51.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":52.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":54.68},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":56.63},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":59.55},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":60.4},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":62.06},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":65.18},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":67.68},{"due_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":65.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.05},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.37},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.12},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.57},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.91},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.93},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.57},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.86},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.2},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.41},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.84},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":7.92,"local_amount":45.26,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":49.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681394793},{"amount":7.98,"local_amount":45.58,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-29T12:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":50.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696605106},{"amount":8.05,"local_amount":45.98,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-19T12:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711524612},{"amount":8.27,"local_amount":47.25,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":51.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731040456},{"amount":8.37,"local_amount":47.82,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":52.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755520125}],"funded_date":"2015-05-21T18:33:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":887863,"name":"Gidion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gidion is 52 years old, father of ten children and lives in Bundibugyo, Uganda.

University (MERU). This is her story: \r\n\r\n1.What do you study at Maharishi Institute? Which classes you enjoy most?\r\nI am studying towards a Bachelor of Arts degree in Management. The classes which I enjoy the most are Marketing Management, Business Law and Ethics, and Career Strategies to name a few. However, I would say all my classes have been pleasant and I have learned and grown with each one of them.\r\n\r\n2.What are your goals after graduating from the Institute? Please be specific: In which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\nI am fascinated by property, design and organizing. Therefore, my five-year plan includes working as an events coordinator, consulting in marketing and advertising and owning properties in Bedworth, part of which I will later develop into communes.\r\n\r\n3.Tell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married? Do you have children?\r\nI was born and briefly raised in Sharpville until my parents divorced.  After, my sister and I moved quite until recent settlement in Soweto. \r\n\r\n4.What do you like to do in your spare time?\r\nI like to read motivational books and watch movies. \r\n\r\n5.How will a Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: Will there be significant changes?\r\nIt will supplement my transport and help me cover other living expenses, especially given that my mother is the sole breadwinner taking care of my siblings, her son, a grandmother, my father, and me. My lifestyle will improve because I will have more time to focus on my studies and time to network in order to secure my future. This is opposed to the stress and worry that I am usually used to.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":16.87,"image":{"id":1884272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is her story: \r\n\r\n1. What do you study at Maharishi Institute? Which classes you enjoy most?\r\nI am studying towards a bachelor of business administration. I enjoy human resource management and marketing class, I actually fell in love with those two classes.  It must have been because I got to understand what was taught in them. They are my best classes so far.\r\n\r\n2. What are your goals after graduating from the Institute? Please be specific: In which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\nAfter graduating I would love to work in the marketing department or human resource department within a company. I would love to work in Johannesburg, which is near my family and also the business city of South Africa. I do not like travelling but I could always make an exception when my job requires me to.\r\n\r\n3. Tell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married? Do you have children?\r\nI was born in a village called Tlagameng at the North West province of South Africa. Both my parents are unemployed. I am the first-born and have a younger sister. I am currently staying with my two aunts who do not have a steady job. We live from the rent of my older aunt\u2019s house. Therefore this means that for us to live or survive the occupants of the rented out house has to pay, and if they fail or delay to do so then it becomes a problem. My other aunt is also trying to make a living out of selling beauty products and income will depend on how many people bought the products.\r\n\r\n4. What do you like to do in your spare time?\r\nIn my spare time I like reading novels.  I enjoy reading a lot. I also enjoy singing and dancing. At other times, I spend my time in the kitchen, trying out some new recipes.\r\n\r\n5. How will a Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: will there be significant changes?\r\nThe Kiva loan will change my life in a positive way.  I will use the money for transport purpose. This will have a great impact in my studies. I will never miss a class because of not having transport money to come to school. The significant change will be that I will always be at school unlike before where I used to miss class due to lack of transport money.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":16.87,"image":{"id":1884218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is her story:\r\n\r\n1. What do you study at Maharishi Institute? Which classes do you enjoy most?\r\n\r\n\"I am doing a BA in Business. Classes that I enjoy the most are Marketing, Leadership, Statistics and Algebra. The reason why I enjoyed them most  is because I believe I was born as a leader, and when I did a leadership course, it really showed me a way forward. I enjoy marketing because I have confidence to speak in public and sell a product. I enjoy statistics and algebra because I have always loved math.\"\r\n\r\n2. What are your goals after graduating from the Institute? Please be specific: In which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\n\r\n\"My goals are to work and raise capital to start up my own business. I am looking into logistics and property investment. To start, I would like to work in a finance department. I have traveled my whole life, ever since I was a kid, so I would definitely like to travel. I adapt easily everywhere I go, and the cities I would like to work in are Johannesburg and Cape Town, but really anywhere would fit me perfectly.\"\r\n\r\n3. Tell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married? Do you have children?\r\n\r\n\"I was born in the Eastern Cape in a town called Matatiele. I have two sisters; unfortunately, the second born passed away. My parents were married, but unfortunately my father also passed away before my sister. He was a breadwinner at home and my mother was a housewife. When my father passed away, life changed for us. We went from going to school wearing shoes and having something to eat to going barefoot and having absolutely nothing in the stomach. We are living on a social grant and there is no other income. I am not married.\"\r\n\r\n4. What do you like to do in your spare time?\r\n\r\n\"Most of the time I spend is on books; I love writing and reading novels and my studies. These are the things that keep me away from the bad things that I see other people my age doing. I also enjoy traveling, dancing and watching movies once in a while. I also love spending time with my family and friends.\"\r\n\r\n5. How will a Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: will there be significant changes?\r\n\r\n\"A Kiva loan will change my life in many ways. I will be able to pay the Maharishi fees and be able to maintain myself. I will buy books that will help build me forward, so that I can be just like anyone. It will help my studies and allow me to get anything that is helpful to finance my studies. Yes, there will be huge significant changes once I start receiving a Kiva loan.\""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":16.87,"image":{"id":1885318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

The house is equipped with running water, electricity and a sewage system. \r\n\r\nShe sells seasonal fruit, such as bananas, oranges, watermelons, melons, mandarins, papayas etc. which she does from a permanent stall during the day every day of the week. \"I began my business with very little money, as a street seller helping my mother...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she has a permanent stall which continuously welcomes customers; the disadvantage is the lack of a storage space. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to sell wholesale, and to have some storage. She wishes to buy seasonal fruit wholesale for her customers and improve her sales.

This is Esita. She is the head teacher of Mpigi Central Primary School, a mixed school in the urban area of Mpigi with 500 students. Mpigi Central School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. \r\n\r\nThe school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 liter tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nMpigi Central School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Esita ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children who fall sick from water-borne diseases, as well as increasing the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":410,"image":{"id":1885474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

Joseph is 22 years old and was asked the following questions by a staff member of the Institute:  This is his story: \r\n1.\tWhat do you study at the Maharishi Institute? Which classes do you enjoy the most?\r\nI\u2019m currently doing my BBA in business administration. It would have to be my financial classes that I like the most. I love elementary algebra and human resource management because I love working with people.\r\n2.\tWhat are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? Please be specific: in which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\nI\u2019m on the verge of starting my own business in construction. I\u2019m really flexible, so I\u2019m prepared to work anywhere because I\u2019m so hungry for success. In terms of sector, I would prefer to work close to Johannesburg, but I believe in no limits so I can work in any city.\r\n3.\tTell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children?\r\nI was born in the small town called Geluksdal in the East Rand, I have one sibling, my younger brother. My mother works as a pre-school teacher and my father is unemployed. I do not have any children and am not married. I\u2019m the oldest and my younger brother is finishing high school next year. Although we are not rich, I was brought up on good morals and my parents believe in hard work and patience.\r\n4.\tWhat do you like to do in your spare time?\r\nI do a lot of community work. I\u2019m a church member and I have a passion for music. I sing in the church choir. I love reading, especially the business bulletin novels, which is how I practice my speech.\r\n5.\tHow will a Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: will there be significant changes?\r\nI use a lot of money for transport. This loan will help cover my transport and get to school on time because the transport I\u2019m using now is not up to standard.  It will also be a weight lifted off my mother\u2019s shoulder."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":16.87,"image":{"id":1884189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She lives with her parents and three siblings (two brothers and one sister). Her father works sporadically as a bricklayer and her mother is a housewife that looks after her younger siblings, as she is the eldest.  \r\n\r\nShe is studying for a degree in Dressmaking and Design. She still has 2 years left until she finishes. She is very interested in her degree as it will lead her into a good job with the possibility of decent wages. For this reason, obtaining her degree would help her to a great extent as she would be able to help her parents with the raising and schooling of her younger siblings. She would like to specialise as a dressmaker. \r\n\r\nBefore asking for this loan she used to collect money from the tips given to her by her relatives and from her father's job in order to pay monthly for her tuition fees, which amounted to large sums of money. However, due to fact that the family has been going through difficult times, she feels that in order to save her dreams from being shattered, it is necessary to ask KIVA for some support so that she can carry on with her studies. \r\n\r\nLiz wants to say to everyone at KIVA: \"Thank you very much for the support that you provide youngsters like myself who want to move their lives forward but cannot accomplish their dreams due to financial difficulties.

After managing the household work, she assists her husband in agricultural work. <br \/><br \/>The source of income for their family is agribusiness, which her husband has been doing for many years. With much work and sacrifice, he mainly grows vegetables, which are in much demand in the region. To cope with the growing price of essential daily commodities, they need to cultivate more crops to generate more income. They have decided to cultivate cucumbers on their farmland, as the crop has a high demand in the present market. Due to the shortage of capital, they are unable to do this. So, Aparna is asking for financial help from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to buy fertilizers and herbicides to cultivate cucumbers on their farm. <br \/><br \/>Her goal is to strengthen her family\u2019s economy. She hopes the loan will help her to grow her agribusiness, which will ultimately help in generating more income.

He studies at the public university located in the city that is the seat of the government and the political-administrative capital.

The climate is cold and dry with a temperature that varies between 1-17 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n\r\nGabriel has a dark complexion, brown eyes, short black hair, short stature, and a medium physique. His mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1 which he speaks with his family. He speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for business. He lives in the home of his working parents and with his working older brother. They live in their own home built out of brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof, wood floor, and with access to drinking water, electricity, and a sewage system.\r\n\r\nHe is majoring in history and is in his 2nd year out of 5. His most notable qualities are his love of reading, enthusiasm for past events, and passion for understanding the events that shaped periods in history. He tells us \"I study and work. I distribute my time between both occupations and I feel happy with my achievements.\" Parallel to his studies, he works as a cameraman filming events like parties, birthdays, baptisms, etc. He conducts this business mostly during the weekend in the evenings which allows him to study the rest of the time. The advantage of his two occupations is that the schedules do not conflict with one another, but the disadvantage is the lack of money to buy a laptop for both. His dream is to finish his studies and pursue his professional career. He wishes to purchase a laptop in order to accomplish both occupations. \r\n\r\nThis is the first sequence of loans with the institution in the 5 years he has been working and the 2 years that he has been going to school. It is for these reasons that Gabriel is requesting a loan to buy a laptop to edit films and to finish his

Her business is pastry-making. She is enterprising, independent, persevering, active, responsible and very hardworking. She does business in the southern part of the city, characterized by the protected \"Espejillos\" area, which is known for its natural beauty, diversity of species and optimal conditions for the practice of extreme sports and is a mandatory part of the ecological tourist route. The climate is subtropical with daytime temperatures between 21 and 35 degrees Celsius. \r\n\r\nCristina is dark-complexioned with brown eyes and long black hair which she wears tied back. She is of short stature with a robust physique and her maternal language is Guaran\u00ed, which is spoken in the area. She speaks Spanish because of the general culture and due to commerce in the city. She lives her life with her partner who works as a hauler. Her children are independent and do not live with her. They live in their own house constructed of brick and cement with a tin roof, a cement floor, and electricity and well water, but no sewage. \r\n\r\nHer business is the production and sale of cakes. She buys flour, eggs, yeast, vanilla extract and other ingredients in order to produce cakes daily. She then sells them as a street vendor to different repeat and casual customers. She says \"I began my business baking cookies, and switched to cakes, which are familiar and equally popular.\" An advantage of her business is that it's customary to eat a piece of cake anytime of day accompanied by any cold or hot beverage. The disadvantage is the shortage of flour and the malfunction of her oven, which after constant use, has broken. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a cake shop where she can exhibit various types of cakes. She wishes to expand her business with the purchase of an industrial oven and wholesale flour. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in five years of doing this work.

They live in a rented house built out of brick and cement, with a corrugated metal roof and wooden floors. It has running water, electricity and, gas, and sewage. Her business is selling wool clothing such as gloves, hats, baby clothes, scarves, wool socks, etc. She sells these items on the street visiting fairs, and businesses around the area, everyday during the day. The advantage of her business is that, due to the cold climate, she has steady sales throughout the year. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to invest in a variety of products. Her dream is to have her daughter produce the clothing that they sell, so that her daughter can have her own business. She would like to buy wool wholesale to knit clothing such as scarves and gloves. This is the second loan with the institution in 5 years of working in this activity.

He had many brothers and sisters, and he was the eldest in the family. At 18 years old Pirmahmad got married and remained living with his parents. Now he has a large family: a wife, five children, and parents. Pirmahmad is a crop farmer. He grows nuts and sells them at the market. He also rears animals. He has four cows. Pirmahmad's wife milks the cows and puts the milk up for sale. Pirmahmad works by the sweat of his brow to provide for his family and ensure they do not go hungry.

She lives with her spouse and has no children. Her business is selling traditional food.  \r\n\r\nShe is enterprising, independent, stable, attentive, responsible and very hardworking. She runs her business in the southern part of the city. Once a year, close to a thousand artisans meet there for the \u2018la Alasita\u2019 festival, where all kinds of things are sold in miniature. The idea is that the miniature thing will materialize and become reality. It has a sub-tropical, warm and very humid climate with a temperature that varies in the day between 21-35 degrees celsius.\r\n\r\nGladys has dark skin, brown eyes, long black hair that she wears braided back, short stature, and a medium build. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks at home, and she speaks Spanish in the general culture and in her business. She lives her life with her spouse, who works as a plumber. They live in a rented room built of brick and cement with a sheet metal roof and a cement floor. It has electricity and well water, but no sewage hookup. The need to improve her business led to her joining some micro-business owners and forming a bank of people with businesses such as: selling vegetables, selling fruit, selling breakfasts, a locksmith shop, selling cleaning items, selling second hand clothing, a tire repair workshop, and selling dairy products. They did this in order to ask for a loan and generate more income. Her business is selling traditional food such as: sopa de remojado (bone soup), majao encapao (ground, dried meat, boiled plantains and rice), rice and cheese (rice, milk and cheese), and more. \u201cI learned to cook from my family heritage. I worked as an assistant and I went off on my own\u2026\u201d she remarks. The advantage of the business is that is has regular customers. The disadvantage is that she doesn't have enough capital to buy produce and ingredients such as pasta, rice, oil, meats, potatoes, etc. Her dream is to open a restaurant. She wants to buy produce and ingredients wholesale to sell traditional food. This is her 8th loan cycle with the institution during the 8 years that she has been doing this activity.  \r\n\r\nThese are the reasons that Gladys is asking for a loan to buy cooking ingredients wholesale in order to open a traditional food restaurant.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3525,"image":{"id":1881792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cooking ingredients wholesale in order to open a traditional food restaurant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-05-22T10:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-21T10:30:02Z","loan_amount":3525,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asunta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha Rossio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Freddy                  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kenia Ysabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1864.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1836.07},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1869.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1903.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1992.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2009.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2045.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.09},{"due_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2121.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2159.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2198.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":273.85},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":274.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.51},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":292.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.49},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":305.95},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.52},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":818.1,"local_amount":5570.08,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5604.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046707},{"amount":561.09,"local_amount":3820.16,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3843.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344545},{"amount":587.7,"local_amount":4001.31,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4025.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554756},{"amount":917.96,"local_amount":6249.95,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6288.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468841},{"amount":640.15,"local_amount":4358.5,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4385.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296674}],"funded_date":"2015-05-22T20:52:59Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":885636,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125.01,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy sugar, beans, eggs, oil, rice, coffee, bread, flour, etc., for her business.

She is married and the mother of seven children. She was born in a rural village and was accustomed to work since childhood. When the other children were playing in the sandbox, Zebormo helped her mother milk cows and take it to the market to sell. When the other children went to the seaside, Zebormo helped her father gather the harvest. \r\n\r\nAt the age of 17, Zebormo got married and started her adult life. Her husband was not able to provide for the family alone, and therefore Zebormo decided to start earning money too. She started working with livestock breeding. Currently she has three cows in her herd. She loves her work very much, and she loves to work in the open air. \r\n\r\nZebormo has seven children, and the youngest one is five months old.
