He is married and a young father of two children. He grew up in a working class family and has known life's difficulties since his childhood. Olimjon completed nine years of school then enrolled in a technical college and studied plumbing skills. Olimjon got married at 18 years of age. Now he has two wonderful children. Olimjon's wife does not have an education, and so she is not able to get a good job. Because of this, in addition to working as a plumber Olimjon began rearing animals. Now he has ten sheep in his flock. Every day Olimjon tends to his flock in the fields. When Olimjon has fattened up the sheep, he sells them and buys young ones in their place. That is how his business goes. Currently Olimjon wants to buy feed for his livestock but he does not have enough money. He has therefore applied to MDO Arvand to receive a loan.

She lives with her partner and has a 4-year-old son. She works selling different products. Carla is an optimistic, energetic, compromised, generous, kind, responsible and hardworking woman. She works as a street vendor in different areas, such as \u201cLa Ceja\u201d and \u201cFeria 16 de Julio\u201d, which are commercial areas located in the eastern side of the city. There are different administrative and commercial buildings, as well as social organizations in this area. The city has cold weather, with temperatures that range between 0 and 12 \u00b0C [32-54 \u00b0F].\r\n\r\nCarla has a dark complexion and brown eyes, and wears glasses. She wears her long black hair tied in the back. She is short and thin. Her mother tongue is Quechua, which is spoken by locals. However, she mainly speaks Spanish at work. She lives together with her husband, who works as a salesman, and her son, who is not yet of school age. They rent a room built with bricks and cement, with a metal roof and wooden floor. It is served with drinking water, electricity, natural gas and sewage.\r\n\r\nCarla sells different products, such as pots, diapers, and beverages. She works as a street vendor and pushes a cart to transport and sell her products. Every once in a while, she and her husband travel to the borders with Peru or Argentina in search for innovative and easy-to-sell products. \u201cI travel regularly with my partner and my son to bring seasonal products. We sell them and then travel again,\u201d she says. The advantage of having this business is that she can take care of her son and work at the same time. The disadvantage is the lack of money to buy more products and fulfill the customers\u2019 needs. Her dream is to open a store and sell products in bulk.\r\n\r\nCarla would like to expand her business by buying seasonal products in bulk, such as jackets, wine, and dried fruits, which are highly-demanded products. This is the first loan she receives from the institution, but she has been in business for two years.\r\n\r\nThis is why Carla is requesting a loan to buy seasonal products and use the profits to pay

\n","en":"Kurbongul is a young \u2018business lady\u2019 starting her first undertaking. She is 27 years old, divorced, with two small children. \r\n\r\nKurbongul wants to breed cattle. Despite her young age and limited experience, she is not afraid of starting her own business. There is a reason to that. Since most of residents in the region of Shahrituz are raising livestock, Kurbongul relies on the opportunity to turn to them for advice at any time. Kurbongul\u2019s parents were also involved in raising livestock, but only for their personal needs.

Her two elder brothers work in a local department store, her elder sister works in party needs store, and her younger brother is in high school.

","en":"Jamshed is an honest and well-mannered man.  He was born in 1977.  Today he is married and the father of three children (one son and two daughters).  His son is a university student.  His daughters are still young: they are 4 and 2 years old.  Jamshed's wife is involved in agriculture and works in their district.

He belongs to a family of nine. His father died in Febuary 2015, and his mother is a housewife. Benjie is the second to the youngest of six siblings. Four of them are already married. His elder sister is a pre-school teacher. <br \/><br \/>Before, Benjie was working at Panasiatic as a reliever janitor for five months, but he stopped because he wanted to undergo training in Bagosphere. Their total monthly family income of PHP 8,000 ($180) is barely enough for them. This motivates Benjie to find means to help the family have more income. That\u2019s why he braved the selection process of Bagosphere and successfully passed it to qualify for the two-month training program that could lead to a call center job. <br \/><br \/>Apart from helping his family, Benjie also dreams to become a successful call center agent and to have a better income, so he can uplift his family from poverty.

with her spouse and four children. Her husband has been running his own tailoring shop in the local market for 15 years. Her husband is solely responsible to fulfill the needs of entire family.\r\n\r\nRukhsana's husband needs to buy different types of tailoring accessories e.g. pieces of cloth, laces, needles, and sewing machine accessories. But due to some financial constraints, her husband is not in a suitable condition to buy these items for his business purpose. Therefore, Rukhsana has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

The disadvantage is his lack of kitchen equipment to increase his food offerings. His dream is to have a large and full-size restaurant. He wants to purchase a rotisserie oven to cook chicken. A rotisserie oven is used to roast food, usually making it rotate in front of, below, or above the heat source. This is his first sequence of loans with the institution in his 3 years of business.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Sergio is requesting a loan to purchase a rotisserie oven to open a restaurant, and use the earnings to cover his son's expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1881918,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a rotisserie oven to open a restaurant, and use the earnings to cover his son's expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-05-22T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-21T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1091.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1088.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1134.94},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1177.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1229.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1276.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.41},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.06},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":159.94,"local_amount":1092.26,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046708},{"amount":159.4,"local_amount":1088.56,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1091.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344547},{"amount":166.18,"local_amount":1134.92,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554758},{"amount":172.5,"local_amount":1178.03,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1181.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468843},{"amount":180.1,"local_amount":1229.93,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1233.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296676},{"amount":186.88,"local_amount":1276.3,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1280.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076851}],"funded_date":"2015-05-27T05:35:23Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Frank","image":null}},{"id":888384,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is 46 years old and married with two children.\r\n\r\nJosephine works hard to provide for her family.

","en":"Moussokoro, who is holding the banner of N'Gasene in the photo, is a member of a group of nine farmers registered with myAgro. They live and work in the village of N'Gouraba in the southeast of Bamako, Mali. Moussokoro, aged 45, is the mother of eight children aged between 10 and 30 years, of whom five are presently enrolled in school. \r\n\r\nThe fact that the family's tradition is anchored in agriculture, the principle source of income and food self-sufficiency for the household, as well as being married to a farmer, moved Moussokoro to practice this activity for 30 years now. Moussokoro grows peanuts and rice on her plot but as a farmer she is faced with difficulties such as the lack of rain and of agricultural supplies. She is beginning her second year with myAgro, and she re-registered because of the system of payment and the high quality seeds and fertilizer. \r\n\r\nThis year Moussokoro is making payments to buy a myAgro package of OPV (openly pollinated variety) seeds and fertilizer to grow peanuts so as to increase the yield on her plot of 0.0625 hectare. Moussokoro has been growing peanuts for 20 years now for their commercial value, since peanuts are a foodstuff she sells at the market.

Violet, a mother of one, has overcome this challenge and has been practicing mixed farming for the past two years. \r\n\r\nViolet, an ever-smiling farmer, has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans that farming is for the older generation. She passionately loves dairy farming and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. Violet's primary source of income has been selling eggs, crops, and milk. She also has a posho mill business to supplement her meager income.\r\n\r\nViolet wakes up early and milks her cows. The humble mom has been selling milk to her neighbors and the local market. She is known for having the best quality milk and through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. Currently, she has more demand than she can supply. \r\n\r\nViolet is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients. A dairy cow will produce between 10 and 20 liters of milk daily. This will allow her to satisfy the demand for her milk. Violet attended training sessions and learned financial management skills through Kiva's field partner, Juhudi Kilimo.

For 10 years now, he has been a farmer. On his land lot of 20 ha Alisher grows all sorts of grapes. He loves his work and takes good care of the land and harvest. His wife helps Alisher with everything. \r\n\r\nAlisher takes all of his harvest to the market for sale. The produce grown with loving care sells very well.

In school she was a very good student. However as a result of lack of funds in her family, she was not able to enter a higher education institute. \r\n\r\nAfter marriage, she realised that in a market economy, she should not sit back twiddling her thumbs and wasting the money which her husband earns. She is a very hardworking and diligent woman. Together with her husband, she fattens up and cares for livestock. She and her husband have been in this business for 5 years. \r\n\r\nThis year, she wants to increase the number of livestock. However, at the same time Tuhtajona has financial difficulties. Thus she has turned to MDO Arvand for a loan. Upon receiving the loan, she plans to buy cattle and feed.

In African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive, hobby for women.

Lucy is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming. This is a big deal for her. She is very excited to start growing different varieties of crops for commercial purposes.

Milking and feeding her own cow is the most enjoyable part for her of farming. She is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in her village. Milk, poultry and vegetables are very perishable, and these products require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that she faces is delivering to the market on time. \n\nKitale area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Susan is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Farmers like Susan will use the motorbike to transport passengers and farm goods to and from the market. They are suited for areas with poor road networks which are inaccessible by cars.

education \u2013 these are just some of the things going around Josphat\u2019s mind. Josphat is a 33-year-old, smallholder farmer based in Kericho, which is a small agricultural center near the famous Rift valley. He owns a small piece of land together with his lovely wife, and they have been blessed with a lovely family. On the land, they have kept dairy cattle and grown vegetables for 7 years. Their main income sources are milk, sheep farming and crops. They recently ventured into a small personal business, or side hustle, as they like to put it. \r\n\r\nFrom Kiva lenders, Josphat is seeking a loan worth KES 20,000 to buy seedlings and grow his horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector.\r\n\r\n It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to afford Josphat access to a loan that will aid him to grow his horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Josphat\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":87.8,"image":{"id":1878002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seedlings and expand his horticulture farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-22T23:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-21T23:50:08Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josphat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.38,"local_amount":3145.22,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3389.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506709},{"amount":52.42,"local_amount":4659.79,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5022.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111687}],"funded_date":"2015-05-23T11:16:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":880945,"name":"Kenneth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kenneth is a small dairy and poultry farmer dying to get his hands on the horticultural market.

","en":"Dilnoza is a joyful woman, born into a working family. She is 28 years old and a single mother. After her divorce from her husband, the raising of their child fell on Dilnoza's shoulders. Dilnoza is courageous, and she surmounts all difficulties in life by way of her strong character. In order to raise her child properly, she began to look for work, but she could not find a suitable job because she did not have a diploma.

Introducing Evangeline, a charismatic woman who is 25 years old and full of energy. She hails from the Nkubu area of Kenya, an area with good and favourable weather patterns that support farming. She is the mother of four children who are under her care from her marriage. \n\nEvangeline completed her secondary school education thanks to the financial support and effort of her parents, but never advanced. This never killed the spirit she has for succeeding in life. Evangeline has been farming for the past five years and through mixed farming, she has been able to take care of her family. She loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of her cows Mutune (from a person's name). \n\nAlthough Evangeline passionately loves farming, she faces the challenge of water shortages. Most of the rainwater goes to waste, which is why she is seeking a loan to buy a water tank. Evangeline comes from an area where there is no piped water. Therefore this water tank will assist her to harvest water during the rainy seasons and also store water for home consumption. Harvested water will assist Evangeline to irrigate her farm, ensuring that there is a constant production of crops. \n\nThis loan will turn around the life of Evangeline, as she will no longer have to walk for long distances in search of water, thus saving her time. Also through the loan she plans to build a modern dairy unit that will prevent her cows from being exposed to harsh weather conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":238.06,"image":{"id":1885298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a water tank and build a modern dairy unit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-23T00:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-22T00:40:06Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evangeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.53},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.7},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.32},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.32,"local_amount":4831,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4873.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378745},{"amount":42.91,"local_amount":4118.97,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4155.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588465},{"amount":48.51,"local_amount":4657.25,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4698.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506752},{"amount":49.79,"local_amount":4779.76,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4822.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023570},{"amount":46.53,"local_amount":4467.1,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4506.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111724}],"funded_date":"2015-06-09T18:23:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tom D"}},{"id":887679,"name":"Annah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"With children to raise, water to fetch, and food to cook, Annah has little time to make money to provide financial support for her family.

It is a big help to most when there are food stalls along the roads where they can eat without going home to just cook. This is the reason why Isabel has chosen to manage a food stall. Since food is always in demand, she earns a good profit from this. \r\n\r\nHowever, Isabel still wants to expand her business. She is asking a loan worth PHP 9 000. She will use this to buy more raw ingredients needed for the food she sells from her food stall. She wants to drive to you her sincerest thanks for your goodness and generosity by now. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she wants her family to progress and improve as well as her current business. She prays that her family will always be free from diseases. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is comprised of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1885247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more raw ingredients needed for her food stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-05-23T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-22T01:20:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2006.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665017982},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2675.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314409},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3344.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523106},{"amount":45,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2006.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433535}],"funded_date":"2015-05-23T01:45:03Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Richard Neuman","image":null}},{"id":888525,"name":"Elvie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvie is 33 years old, married and has three children.

Her challenges are lack of rainfall and quality fertilizers as well as access to the market.\r\n\r\nAraba is starting her first year with myAgro. She signed up because of its installment plan to pay for quality fertilizers. This time Araba is making payments for a pack of myAgro OPV [Open Polinated Variety] seeds and fertilizers to increase the yield of peanuts on her field of 0.0625 ha [0.15 acres].

Her business is baking traditional bread.  She is a good mother, independent, content, happy, joyful, responsible and very hard-working.  She operates her business in a market in the Southern zone of the city, characterized by its location on the banks of a beautiful waterway, its traditional walks on the weekends, its rustic buildings with regional materials where you can eat traditional food and play some sports, and its subtropical climate with temperatures ranging from 21-35 degrees Celsius during the whole year.

Her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks with her family and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and the business she operates.  She shares her life with her husband who works as a chauffeur and with her baby who is nursing.  They live in a rented room made of bricks and cement with a corrugated tin roof and a ceramic tile floor that has services like running water, electricity, and sewage.  Her business is preparing and selling a variety of breads: rice bread (rice flour base), corn bread (corn flour base), milk bread (milk base), meat empanadas (thin dough filled with beef or chicken and vegetables), wheat bizcochos (hard balls of wheat flour) and others.  She operates her business in a room of her home that is set up as a bakery, and sells her bread on foot to different stores and places of business.  \"I started my business in this place, and with the help of my husband, we divide responsibilities and take care of our baby,\" she comments.  The advantage of her business is that she interacts daily with customers and the disadvantage is the lack of flour so that she can bake in greater quantities and attract more customers.

They live in a house owned by the family. It is made of brick and cement with a tin roof and wood floors, and has drinking water, electricity, gas and sewerage. \r\n\r\nHis business is selling bags, which he works every day of the week during the day. He works through visiting neighborhood shops, clothing stores, all types of businesses, to deliver and sell the bags. These bags are used to transport or protect all types of materials. \"I began my business with a minimum amount of money. I was changing the products. I have clients that ask me for all types of bags...\" he says. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of his business is that his products can be used for almost anything. The disadvantage is the lack of money to buy the products at wholesale price. His dream is to open a retail store for plastic containers. He wants to achieve buying the synthetic bags at wholesale. This is the 1st sequence of loans with the institution in 20 years that he has been doing this job. It is for these reasons that Santiago is asking for a loan to buy synthetic bags and plastic containers to open a retail store.
