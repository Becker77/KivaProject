Although she makes profits through milk selling, her cows are not producing maximum output of milk. She is kindly requesting for a loan to buy a chaff cutter. A chaff cutter is a mechanical device that is used in cutting hay into smaller pieces before being mixed with other forages for better feeding of the cow.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

This is Benon. He is the Director of Studies at Kagote Seed Secondary School, a mixed school in the rural area of Kabarole with 420 students. Kagote School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Kagote School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

Up until now, she has been raising lambs at home for sale. Khabiba's husband helps her in her work.\r\nKhabiba is 53 years old, and has one 25 year-old son. Her son is married and has children.

The school does not currently have consistent access to clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system would therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. \r\n\r\nDavid is requesting a loan for the Margherita School to cover the cost of installing an maintaining two UV water filtration systems to provide clean drinking water for students. The loan will enable the school to purchase treatment systems with two 450 liter tanks that which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. Margherita School will repay its loan from its school fees, which are collected each term. David ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":506.29,"image":{"id":1886434,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for students","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kasese","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-05-23T12:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-22T12:30:04Z","loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.03,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margherita School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6070000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":31,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":758800},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":758800},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":758800},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":758800},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":758800},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":758800},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":758800},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":758400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":253.14},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.14},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.14},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":253.14},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.14},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.14},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":253.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":235.98,"local_amount":758800,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:34:16Z","rounded_local_amount":759417.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.17,"payment_id":696580915},{"amount":249.28,"local_amount":758800,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":759417.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.86,"payment_id":755507208}],"funded_date":"2015-05-23T17:15:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":888713,"name":"Benson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benson is a sales agent working for iSmart Kenya, an organization with a mission to create jobs for youth and women in slums.

She runs the household efficiently and manages to save a small amount each week.\r\n\r\nNow she is seeking the loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to purchase the dairy cow so that she can develop her milk-selling business.

Becoming a Mary Kay consultant served as a perfect solution for Maria and helped to fuel her own entrepreneurial aspirations.\r\n \r\nMaria is now the proud owner of Guapi Sales, operating out of Carrollton, Texas.  She will be offering Mary Kay products and make-up consulting. She currently employs one full-time employee and plans to hire one part-time worker later this year. \r\n\r\nShe came to LiftFund seeking support for both marketing and inventory. With her loan, Maria will be able to push more products and build marketing pieces such as signage, business cards and flyers for her new business.

in Oceanside, CA, that offers innovative fitness classes such as pole fitness, yoga, aerial arts, calisthenics, partner yoga, and personal training. Andrea is the owner of Darkside Fitness and her passion in life has always been helping others. She discovered dancing as a child and competed and performed in a variety of dance types such as ballet, tap, jazz, and pointe. As an adult, she began seeking a form of dance she could get back into as she had enjoyed it so much as a child. Although she has never worked as an exotic dancer, she appreciates pole as a sensual form of art and enjoys empowering women and men through fitness and dance. \r\n\r\nAndrea began performing in 2012, teaching pole and yoga in 2013, and competing in 2014. She enjoyed teaching at a local studio, but saw an opportunity to open her own studio and reach more men and women, make classes more affordable, and provide a variety of classes that would decrease risk for injury and improve overall well-being. As an occupational therapist of 9 years and a personal trainer, Andrea believes in a holistic approach to fitness and incorporates a combination of strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular training into her fitness classes.\r\n\r\nStarting this business has been challenging for Andrea for a number of reasons. Although she has had a great career for 9 years and has been working very hard, she has run into quite a bit of bad luck financially. Just a few of the things that she has had to overcome over the past few years include owning a house in Atlanta that had the roof destroyed by a hurricane, having the house later vandalized with over $30,000 worth of damage, having renters in the house that caused over $5,000 worth of damage, and most recently, a ruptured appendix that cost her over $13,000.\r\n\r\nThe money from this loan will be used for fitness equipment such as fitness poles, aerial silks, aerial hoops, calisthenics equipment, yoga equipment, and safety equipment. Without this loan, there is no way Andrea would be able to afford this equipment which will help many people achieve their personal fitness goals \u2013 thanks to Kiva for helping her make that happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":726.62,"image":{"id":1880732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Kiva

Since she was five years old, she wanted nothing more than to not only be a dancer but to own a dance school. Growing up, dancing was the one thing in life she looked forward to in her week. She came from a not so great home; they had very little money. Toni decided very young that she would put in whatever work was needed to achieve her dream. \r\n\r\nElite is now approaching its third year and it still sometimes feels like a dream. Toni calls it the \u201cmiracle dance studio\u201d because without some work of God, it would have never happened. Dreams are being lived and built here. Toni\u2019s students are her most precious part of Elite. There is nothing better than helping and watching them achieve everything they want as well.\r\n\r\nLike any business the financial part can often hold a strain. Toni started this business with nothing of her own, but with the help of organizations like VEDC she has been able to push through. Each year things look up and this loan will help her make it through those dreaded summer months of almost no income. Toni appreciates all that Kiva does. What happens at Elite every day is amazing, and Toni herself, her staff, and her students thank you.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":771.64,"image":{"id":1879782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Kiva

La preparaci\u00f3n consiste en calentar una olla o sart\u00e9n para esparcir el ma\u00edz, hasta que explote, \u201cvendo a la hora del recreo y salida en los colegios cercanos, ya llevo varios a\u00f1os en el rubro\u2026\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que cuenta con clientes continuos, la desventaja es la \u00e9poca de vacaciones escolares donde las ventas bajan. Su sue\u00f1o es abrir una tienda de granos y semillas, ella desea realizar la compra de un carrito pipoquero y heladero para cambiar el que tiene que ya est\u00e1 desgastado. Esta es la 2 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 10 a\u00f1os que desarrolla esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Sofia solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de un carrito pipoquero y heladero para reemplazar el que tiene y con los beneficios abrir una tienda de granos.\n","en":"54-year-old Sofia is married and has three children aged 12, 14 and 16. She has a business selling popcorn and ice cream. She is a good mother and is optimistic, attentive, dependable, likeable, responsible and very hard working. She runs her business in the 'plan 3000' area which is the area of greatest growth in the city. The people who live there are mainly from other cities. It has a warm sub-tropical climate with a temperature which varies between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade during the day. \r\n\r\nSofia is dark-skinned with brown eyes and long black hair which she wears in a plait. She is short and slim and wears traditional dress (hat, shawl and full skirt). Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks within the family and for general and work purposes she speaks Spanish. In the photo she is standing first on the right, wearing a pink blouse and blue apron. She shares her life with her husband who works as a builder and her children who are at school. They live in their own accommodation built from bricks and cement with a corrugated metal roof and earth floor which has running water, electricity and sewerage. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling 'pipocas' or popcorn, which is made from corn. The preparation involves heating a saucepan or frying pan of corn until it explodes. Sofia says 'I sell during breaks and at the end of the school day at nearby schools and have been doing this for several years'. The benefit of her business is that she has a continuous supply of customers but the disadvantage is that her sales go down during the school holidays. Her dream is to open a shop selling grains and seeds. She wants to buy a cart for selling popcorn and ice cream to replace the one she has which is worn out. This is her second loan cycle with the institution in the 10 years she has been running this business. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons Sofia is asking for a loan to buy a popcorn\/ice cream cart to replace the one she has and to open a shop selling grains with the profits she makes."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3523.31,"image":{"id":1882034,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cart for selling popcorn and ice cream to replace the one she has and with the profits open a shop selling grain.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-05-23T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-22T15:30:03Z","loan_amount":4100,"lender_count":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Constantina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Eusebi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pablo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3171.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3178.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3293.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3413.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3537.85},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3800.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3938.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":464.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465.35},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":482.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":499.85},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518.04},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":536.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":556.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":576.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":929.79,"local_amount":6349.79,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":6369.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344550},{"amount":482.29,"local_amount":3293.7,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3303.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554761},{"amount":1017.89,"local_amount":6951.44,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6972.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468846},{"amount":536.9,"local_amount":3666.63,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3677.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296679},{"amount":556.44,"local_amount":3800.09,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3811.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076854}],"funded_date":"2015-06-21T15:42:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":888860,"name":"Lulibeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lulibeth is 40 years old and married with one child.

Three of the children are in school.\r\n\r\nAwa has worked in farming now for 17 years, because it has been a family tradition, and it is a principle source of income and a food supply for her family. Awa grows groundnuts and okra on her piece of land, but must face many difficulties, especially the lack of farming materials and quality fertilizer. \r\n\r\nAwa has started her first year with myAgro and joined because of the possibility of increasing her yields from myAgo services and the positive reputation myAgro has in the neighboring villages. This year Awa will make payments to buy myAgro OPV seeds and fertilizer to grow groundnuts and increase her yields on her 0.125 hectare of land.\r\n\r\nIt has now been 10 years since Awa has been growing groundnuts for their nutritional value--they can be directly consumed by the family and used as a sauce base.  They also have a commercial value, because they can be sold at the market.\r\n\r\nWith an increase in yields and earnings, Awa plans to buy agricultural materials and work in commerce. \r\n\r\nAwa mentioned that, \"I want to build a big shop to conduct commerce in.\" Finally, she hopes to also be able to cover her children's school fees.

Three of the children are in school.\r\n\r\nKorotim has worked in farming for 10 years now, because it is a family tradition, it provides a principal source of revenue, it provides food for the household, and also because she is married to another farmer. Korotim grows corn and millet on her piece of land, but she faces difficulties, especially a lack of farming materials and quality fertilizer.\r\n\r\nKorotim has started her first year with myAgro and joined because of the payment system they have and the possibility of increasing her yields from the myAgro searches. This year, she will make payments to buy myAgro fertilizer to grow groundnuts and increase her yield on her 0.125 hectare of land.\r\n\r\nIt has been 10 years since Korotim started growing corn for its profitability. With an increase in yields and earnings, Korotim plans to work in commerce.

She is 33 and lives in the Bohtar region. She is a responsible and hospitable woman who is pleasant to talk to. She lives with her husband and two children aged seven and four. Her husband is currently working in Russia so he can earn money to feed his family. Nigina works sewing women's clothing to order, a business she has had for more than four years. \r\n\r\nNigina is looking for a loan because she wants to finish home renovations. She has been able to renovate only one room. The remaining rooms in her home remain unrenovated and Nigina wants to take out a loan so she can finish them. She intends to use the loan amount to purchase building materials, as well as to buy a new sewing machine, because her current one has gotten old. \r\n\r\nNigina has lived in an old house for many years and saved money for years to pay for renovations. She was very upset to learn that she didn't have enough to cover the costs of the renovations and her only option is to take out a loan.

She is 42 years old and has four children of which one is in College and one in High School and the rest are not of school age yet. She is married to Segio, a security guard. The couple work hard to provide for the needs of their family.\r\n\r\nMaricel has been selling fruits and vegetables for six years already. She buys her veggies and fruits from a wholesaler on a farm and sells them by the kilo. She already has regular customers in the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 800 in sales every day. \r\n\r\nMaricel is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan to purchase more quantities of vegetables and fruits to sell. She will use the loan to pay for veggies such as cabbage, string beans, eggplant, squash, potatoes, carrots and fruits like bananas and pineapples.  Veggies and fruits are already a staple in Filipino households to make more nutritious and delicious dishes. She is thanking God and you in advance for the good return on her investment and the financial help that will be extended to her for it will surely help cover their daily sustenance and pay for her children's schooling.\r\n\r\nMaricel hopes to sustain and grow her business. She prays for God to allow her family to prosper and have a happy and quiet life.

She is still continuing the business because it provides a good income due to her loyal customers. Someday, she will have a legacy to leave to her children. Remedios wants to expand her rice production so that her customers will be served well and she will be able to supply more sacks in the market.

It requires more maintenance charges on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nDue to insufficient financial means, her husband is unable to do the maintenance on his taxi. Therefore Naseem has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan Naseem's husband can afford the maintenance cost easily. And provide the better transport facilities to earn a profitable income. Naseem  also plans to make savings with the profit amount of her husband's income to meet her family's needs in future.\r\nNaseem is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":118.85,"image":{"id":1886887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Job

It is important that her van is always in good running condition for safety and for efficient service. Her earnings from her transport service will definitely help sustain her family's daily needs and the educational expenses of her children.

She prays for God's travelling mercies for all the trips of her van service. She dreams to see all of her children become professionals someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is single and has an 8-year-old son and a 5-year-old daughter. Her business is transportation.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, entrepreneurial, optimistic, persistent, responsible, and very hard-working. She operates her business in the Sacaba area, a rural area characterized by being the collection center for agricultural products such as fruits, vegetables, meats, etc., and for its ecotouristic and educational parks, as an alternative to the urban and traditional [parks]. It has a mild climate throughout the year, with a temperature that varies during the day between 7 and 23 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nHeidy has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair that she ties in the style of a pony tail, short stature, and a thin physical build. Her maternal language is Quechua, which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish for general culture and for her business. She shares her life with her children. Her son is in school. Her daughter is not yet of school age. They live in a house inherited from her family that is made of bricks and cement with a tile roof and dirt floor. It has electricity and potable water provided by an electrical pump. There is no sewer system. \r\n\r\nHer business is transportation. Two years ago she bought a vehicle that a driver operates, and he pays her a daily rent. The vehicle serves as a taxi and goes through the rural zones of the areas, where the roads are dirt. The zone where she lives recently gained access to a potable water connection. \"My vehicle gives me an income. The rest of the time I use it doing seasonal business, and recently, after many years, we are going to be able to have access to potable water, \" she comments. The advantage of her business is that transportation has great demand in the area, because the distances are long. The problem is the lack of money for the connection to potable water. Her dream is to have potable water in her home. She wants to make the connection to potable water in her kitchen, bathroom, and laundry so that her children can grow up healthy and strong. This is her first loan with the institution in the two years that she has had this business.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Heidy is applying for a loan for the potable water connection in her

He successfully serviced his first loan of KES 65,000 and now he is applying for the second.  He is extremely likely to repay on time, and in regular installments, as no major risks were identified during borrower appraisal.

Grace has been farming for the past 40 years. Through these years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. <br \/><br \/>Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Grace is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. <br \/><br \/>Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals for resale. Kenya's Nyamira area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Grace could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. <br \/><br \/>Accessing funds has been a challenge for Grace, but she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. <br \/><br \/>Grace believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable a permanent change in her life and increase her business.

Trash is not actively separated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials.
