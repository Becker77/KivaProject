She is single and has two sons, aged 2 and 4, and a daughter who is 6 years old. Her business is selling cement. \r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, enterprising, dependable, optimistic, generous, responsible and very hard-working. She operates her business in an area called \u2018Sacaba,\u2019 which is known as the \"capital of chicharr\u00f3n [fried pork].\" Here, cooks and customers come together to enjoy the traditional cuisine of the valley. It has a temperate climate throughout the year, with daytime temperatures varying between 7 and 23 degrees Centigrade.\r\n\r\nJanett has brown skin, dark eyes and long black hair which she wears tied behind her. She is short in stature and has a medium build. Her mother tongue is Quechua, which is spoken in the area, and she also speaks Spanish due to the general culture and the business she carries out. She shares her life with her children; the older one is in school, and the younger ones are not yet of school age. \r\n\r\nThey live in a room that is owned by the family, built of brick and cement with a roof of metal sheeting and an earthen floor. The home has an electrical connection and well water supplied with a pump. There is no sewer connection. The water in the area comes from the river or from wells. Recently, water connections have become available to some villagers. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling cement. Earlier, homes were built from adobe, and cement was too expensive for the villagers. Now there are some brick factories nearby, so that the demand for cement has grown. \"I noticed that there was beginning to be demand for cement, and I started my business delivering the bags to the construction sites,\" she comments. The advantage of her business is that demand is growing, but her disadvantage is the lack of a water connection for her family with small children. Her dream is to have piped-in water in her home, so she can have running water in her kitchen, bathroom and laundry area, and so that her family can stop drinking dirty well water. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan sequence with the institution within the two years that she has been doing this work. For these reasons, Janett is requesting a loan to pay for a drinking water connection for her kitchen, bathroom and laundry area, so that her family can stop drinking dirty well water. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1882881,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to pay for a drinking water connection for her kitchen, bathroom and laundry area, so that her family can stop drinking dirty well water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-05-24T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-23T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janett","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10499,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":524.07},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":492.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":502.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":519.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":512.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":551.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":546.73},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":553.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":578.65},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":570.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":604.94},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":613.4},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":622.88},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":631.13},{"due_date":"2016-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":650.41},{"due_date":"2016-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":660.53},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":674.53},{"due_date":"2016-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":689.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.41},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.42},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.05},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.87},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.1},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.48},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.47},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.94},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.98},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":76.12,"local_amount":524.07,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":525.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046713},{"amount":71.48,"local_amount":492.12,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":493.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344553},{"amount":73,"local_amount":502.54,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":504.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554763},{"amount":75.43,"local_amount":519.32,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":521.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468849},{"amount":1228.97,"local_amount":8460.95,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":8491.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296682}],"funded_date":"2015-05-25T15:17:42Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":889247,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is 24 years old and has a baby girl who is only eight months old.

Her mother along with her step-father worked all their lives in this business and have branches in different places in Chocont\u00e1 y Gachancip\u00e1, They sold her the branch that she currently manages. <br \/><br \/>She offers tire sales, tire repairs and accessories in her shop. Her business is located on the main road and has easy access for those who have a problem with one of their tires. Once their tire is repaired they have to pay for the service. During the rather long timetable from 6 am until 10 pm the owners of vehicles like trucks, buses, cars and motorcycles can get their repairs done. <br \/><br \/>Currently she is requesting a loan from Kiva, her first loan she had had from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to have the necessary money to buy spare parts. Diana is the mother of a two year old daughter for whom she wants to provide well-being and a good education. Her goal is to buy tires of different brands."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1882059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy spare parts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-05-24T15:21:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-23T15:21:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":81.61,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79417},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87800},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90434},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93147},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95941},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98819},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101784},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104837},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107982},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111222},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114558},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117995},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121535},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125181},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128937},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132805},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136789},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150817}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.31},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.26},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.56},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.89},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.27},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.69},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.15},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.65},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.2},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.8},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.44},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.14},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.06,"local_amount":79417,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:55:19Z","rounded_local_amount":80681.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.69,"payment_id":681350577},{"amount":32.89,"local_amount":87800,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":89197.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.42,"payment_id":696560837},{"amount":67.8,"local_amount":183581,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":186503.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.22,"payment_id":711475564},{"amount":634.64,"local_amount":1649202,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:25:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1675457.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":66.28,"payment_id":730994429}],"funded_date":"2015-06-22T12:31:51Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T14:25:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":889266,"name":"Lourdes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lourdes is 54 years old and married with one child.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

With charisma and smiles, she knows how to farm and sell her farm produce. She is a smallholder farmer in the Kitale area of Kenya. In the past twelve years, she has bred more than five dairy cows, developed her farm, and planted and sold a variety of crop. She says the secret to her success is thinking of farming as a way to make money, not just as a traditional way of life \u2013 adopting new technologies and methods, crop diversification, record-keeping and good planning also help. \r\n\r\nCaroline was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming. Through her dairy cow, she is able to get between 10-15 liters a day, and this helps her support her family. Caroline also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements and that is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, she will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques; using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. Caroline is visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year.

Fanta is beginning her second year with myAgro, and she re-registered because of the high-quality seeds and fertilizer. This year Fanta is making payments to purchase a myAgro package of fertilizer for growing peanuts so as to increase her yield on her plot of 0.25 hectare. Fanta has been cultivating peanuts for 10 years now, for their commercial value, since peanuts are a foodstuff she sells at the market, and also for their productive and commercial value. With the increase in her yield and her income, Fanta plans to raise livestock. Finally, Fanta would also like to build a house for her family.

Dramane is entering his second year with myAgro and renewed his affiliation because of the payment system and training in agricultural techniques, and the prospects of increasing crop yields through services offered by myAgro.\r\n\r\nThis year Dramane is making payments to buy a bag of myAgro fertilizer to cultivate maize, so he can increase crop yields on his one hectare parcel (2.44 acres). For the past 15 years Dramane has been cultivating maize for its food crop value, crop yields and market profitability.\r\n\r\nWith increased yields and income Dramane plans to raise livestock and buy agricultural equipment.

Aged 49, Debi is the mother of four children, of whom two are presently in school. Agriculture permits her to ensure self-sufficiency for her family, but the love of agriculture moved Debi to work in this field for 30 years now. \r\n\r\nDebi grows peanuts and rice on her plot but as a farmer she has to face difficulties such as lack of rain, of high-quality fertilizer, and of herbicides. Debi is beginning her second year with myAgro and she re-registered because of the system of payment and the high-quality seeds. This year Debi is making payments to purchase a myAgro package of fertilizer for growing peanuts so as to increase the yield on her plot of 0.25 hectare. \r\n\r\nDebi has been cultivating peanuts for 10 years now for their value as a foodstuff, explaining that peanuts are directly edible for the family and are used as a base for sauces in cooking. They also have a commercial value, since peanuts are a foodstuff she sells at the market. With the increase in her yield and her income, Debi plans to raise livestock and be able to do small-scale commerce. Finally, Debi also hopes to cover the school fees of her children as well as  ensuring food self-sufficiency for her family.

He is married to Yolanda, with whom he has four children who are dependent on him. One of his children in is high school while the others are in elementary school. Gerardo's dream is to be able to provide his children with and education so that they have opportunities that he never had. Gerardo's income depends totally on his organic coffee production, which he sells through COCAFCAL, an organization he belongs to. Gerardo is getting his land ready to replant after they were damaged by the mushroom blight from 2012-2013. \r\n\r\nGerardo has produced coffee for as long as he can remember. First, he did so with his father and later he starting growing his own crops. \"The production of coffee is what has fed us throughout our lives,\" says Gerardo. This region has the best conditions to produce special coffees (with unique flavors and aromas), a characteristic that Gerardo takes advantage of with the technical support of COCAFCAL in order to be able to enjoy a secure market and the best prices for his coffee. \r\n\r\nGerardo is requesting a loan in order to renovate 0.75 hectares of land and maintain the 0.75 hectares that he has already planted (which is shown in the photograph). Gerardo's plants are not yet producing fruit (coffee begins production at two years old). With this loan, he will be able to buy a nursery to sow plants, and organic supplies and fertilizers, and to pay laborers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1882900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy organic coffee plants, organic fertilizers, and other organic ingredients necessary to plant coffee on his land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Pedro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":448,"posted_date":"2015-05-24T16:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-23T16:50:11Z","loan_amount":6400,"lender_count":223,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jerardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":140000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":62,"loan_amount":6400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2018-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":39936.12},{"due_date":"2019-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":46325.9},{"due_date":"2020-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":53737.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1825.65},{"due_date":"2019-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2117.76},{"due_date":"2020-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2456.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-06-19T22:02:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Craven","image":1668972}},{"id":889319,"name":"Saida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This young girls name is Saida.

Meet Ruth, 31 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Nyamaiya, a remote village in Nyamira, Kenya. She is happily married and is blessed with 5 adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last 14 years and has gained a great deal of experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Nyamira area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high.\r\n\r\nLike many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the high demand. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nBeing a smallholder farmer accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved and that she will be able to buy more poultry.

The family tradition is anchored in agricultural practice, the main source of income and food self-sufficiency of the home, which prompted Adama to practice this activity over the past 32 years.\r\n\r\nAdama cultivates maize and rice on his plot of land, but as a farmer must face difficulties such as the lack of rain, agricultural equipment, and high-quality seeds. Adama is entering his first year with myAgro and became affiliated because of the payment system, the training in agricultural techniques, and access to the marketplace.\r\n\r\nThis year Adama is making payments to buy a bag of myAgro seeds and fertilizer to cultivate maize, so he can increase crop yields on his 0.25 hectare parcel (0.62 acres). For the past 12 years Adama has been cultivating maize for its food crop value and also for its market value, as maize is a food product he sells at the market.\r\n\r\nWith increased yields and income Adama plans to become a merchant and buy agricultural equipment. Finally Adama also hopes to cover the children's school fees as well as ensure his family's nutritional self-sufficiency.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1883012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy a package of seeds and fertilizer to cultivate maize and increase his parcel's agricultural productivity","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Tiakadougou-dialakoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-24T17:30:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-23T17:30:19Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doumbia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doumbia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dramane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maramadje","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bahawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanaba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bakary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lassine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salif","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bakary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nianamba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Sali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Niakale","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Karim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":751000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":751000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1325,"local_amount":751000,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":762061.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401652}],"funded_date":"2015-05-25T02:22:45Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":889341,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The person in the photo is Joseph, 53 years old; he is married and has a family of six children.

Maimouna is starting her first year with myAgro and registered because of the perspective of increasing her yield through the services proposed by myAgro. \r\n\r\nThis year, Maimouna is making payments to purchase a myAgro package of OPV (openly pollinated variety) seeds and fertilizer to grow peanuts so as to increase her yield on her plot of 0.0625 hectares. Maimouna has been growing peanuts for 20 years now for their value as a foodstuff, explaining that peanuts are directly edible by the family and are used as a basic sauce in cooking, and also for their commercial value since she sells peanuts at the market. \r\n\r\nWith the increase in her yield and her income, Maimouna is planning to buy fertilizer and pesticides.

Her business is in the \"benefit society\" area, a very sought-after place for people who want to have any kind of store or business; it has the Benefit Society Market, which is heavily trafficked by buyers from all over the city.  The climate is subtropical with a temperature that varies during the day between 21-35 degrees centigrade.  \r\n\r\nWilgermine has olive skin, dark, almond-shaped eyes, long, black hair tied back; she is short and has a thin build; her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish in general and because of her work (she is seated, wearing a floral top and a blue skirt).  She shares her life with her husband, who works as a salaried employee, and her children, who are in school; they live in house the family owns that is made of brick and cement, with a sheet metal roof and tiled floor and that has electricity, potable water, and plumbing.  Because of her drive to better herself she started a bank with people who have businesses, such as selling dairy products, selling traditional food, selling floral arrangements, selling chicken, selling empanadas, selling costume jewelry and selling tires to request loans and improve their businesses.  Her business is selling natural health products, such as to energize and rejuvenate the body, stimulate the immune system, develop resistance to illness, improve blood circulation, etc.  \"I started my business after a relative fell gravely ill; I found the most effective medicines and offered them to other sick people,\" she tells us.  In tandem with this business she works as a private accountant, doing all kinds of balancing requested by her clients.  The advantage of her business is that the market is big and product is effective; the disadvantage is the lack of money to stock her business with merchandise.  Her dream is to open a distribution center; she wants to buy natural medicine products to stock her business.  This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the two years she has had her business. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Wilgermine is requesting  loan to buy natural medicines for health to open a distribution center.

She is a member of a group of four farmers who live and work in the village of Tinkele in the southeast of Bamako and who are registered with myAgro. Aminata is 35 and has seven children between the ages of five and 24 of whom six attend school at the present time. Farming is firmly integrated into the family traditions, it is the principal source of income and enables the family to be self-sufficient for their food and also for their income. These are the reasons why Aminata has been in this profession for 20 years now. Aminata grows peanuts on her plot of land, but as a farmer she must cope with difficulties such as drought and lack of agricultural materials. This is Aminata's first year with myAgro. She registered with them because of the payment system and the quality of their fertiliser. She was also convinced by the arguments of the myAgro's agents about their method. This year Aminata will buy a packet of myAgro fertiliser for the cultivation of peanuts in order to improve the yield on her plot of 0.125 hectares.

He enjoys resolving mathematical problems, he likes understanding flow charts, and he has a helpful character, \"I study and I work, my activities don't intersect and I try to give the best of myself in both cases...\" he said.\r\n\r\nParallel to his studies, he works selling cellular telephones in his fixed post. The advantage of his occupation is that the hours don't intersect with each other, the disadvantage is the lack of money to pay fees for the whole year to finish quickly. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to be a professional, to find a good job, and he would like to pay the fees for his program in advance to receive a discount. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in the 2 years he has dedicated to professional studies. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor this reason David is asking for a loan to pay the university fees, to finish his professional program quickly and to work in his field of study. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":481.54,"image":{"id":1883075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay university fees, to finish his professional career quickly and to work in his field of study.

This is Bintou's second year with myAgro. She registered with them again because of the quality of their seeds and fertiliser. This year Bintou will buy a packet of myAgro fertiliser to grow peanuts in order to improve the yield on her plot of 0.125 hectares. Bintou has been growing peanuts for 36 years, as it has commercial value, it is a product that she sells at the market.

The group members live and work in the village of Bagnakoro, to the Southeast of Bamako in Mali. Modibo is 42 years old and has 12 children, 10 of whom are attending school. Modibo has been engaged in farm work for 32 years now. Farming has been the traditional occupation of his family and the main source of income and food for the household. Modibo grows peanuts, corn and cotton on his field. His challenge is having insufficient land to cultivate. \r\n\r\nThis is Modibo's second year with myAgro. He has renewed his membership because of an installment plan allowing him to obtain quality seeds and fertilizers. This year Modibo is making payments on a pack of myAgro fertilizers needed to increase the yield of corn on his field of 1 ha [2.5 acres]. Modibo has been growing corn for 32 years due to its commercial value and market demand. With the increase of his crop yield and his revenues, Modibo plans to start raising livestock.

from the right and pointing his thumb up in the photo. The other farmers in the group are Aji, Ima and Aran. They are standing in front of a cow house. Anto has a family with two children. All of them live in a small village in Bantul, Jogjakarta, Indonesia.\r\n\r\nAnto has been running a small-scale vegetable farming and have a few cows to be fattened to resale. His business is going well. He also works as a hamlet-chief for his village and he was concerned to see many poor farmers there. However, he was troubled to see a high price of non-renewable cooking gas and also the cow dung was wasted without further processing, which is polluted the water in his village.\r\n\r\nAfter socialized by Yayasan Rumah Energi (YRE) and Bina Energy Mandiri Persada, CV (a local business enterprise \u2013 biogas construction partner of YRE) about Household Biogas (BIRU) program, Anto saw that biogas is a good solution of his problem. He saw an opportunity to reduce his dependence on non- renewable cooking gas. In addition, he also wants to use bio-slurry (biogas residue) as organic fertilizer for his plants. Thereafter, Anto invited three of his friends above to form a farmer group. He is keen to purchase a bio digester, but he does not have sufficient capital for it. A loan from Kiva will help him and other farmer group members to make it possible.\r\n\r\nHe have an optimism that if he can build bio digester, he can use the bio-gas for cooking, and bio-slurry (biogas residue) as fertilizer for his plantation. He also want to share the remaining bio-slurry to his  neighbors. He hopes that in the future, he can invite the whole farmers in his village to use biogas and create his village as an energy and food self-sufficient village. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":89.59,"image":{"id":1885964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion","Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To build bio-digesters facility and utilize the biogas residues as organic fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bantul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":423,"posted_date":"2015-05-25T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-24T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aran","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aji","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":14000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2016-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2016-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2017-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2017-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2017-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2017-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2017-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583333},{"due_date":"2017-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583335},{"due_date":"2017-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583336},{"due_date":"2017-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583336}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.8,"local_amount":583333,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T18:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":588871.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731207058},{"amount":44.79,"local_amount":583333,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:34:10Z","rounded_local_amount":588871.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752294645}],"funded_date":"2015-05-28T01:40:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":889455,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John, who is 42 years old, is married to Eunice and supports 5 members in the family.

She is a member of a group of 18 farmers registered with myAgro, who live and work in the village of Bekossokoro, located south-east of Bamako, Mali. Mamine is 43 years old and the mother of ten children, ages 1 to 15.  Seven of her children go to school. \r\n\r\nThe family tradition is anchored in agricultural practice, which constitutes the main source of income and provides food self-sufficiency for the family.  For this reason, Mamine decided to become a farmer 15 years ago.  She now grows groundnut, rice and market vegetables on her plot of land but, like all farmers, she is faced with difficulties such as the lack of rain, the lack of agricultural supplies and of high-quality fertilizers.  Mamine is starting her first year with myAgro.  She decided to join because of the payment system, the high-quality seeds and high-quality fertilizers that she could purchase.  This year, she is making payments to purchase a myAgro package of OPV (openly pollinated variety) seeds and some fertilizer to grow maize and groundnut in order to increase her yield on her 0.5 hectare plot of land.\r\n\r\nMamine has been growing groundnut for 15 years now for its food production qualities.

She is a member of a group of 7 farmers registered with myAgro, who live and work in the village of M'Piela, located south-east of Bamako, Mali. Bintou is 50 years old and the mother of seven children, three of whom currently attend school.\r\n\r\nThe family tradition is anchored in agricultural practice, which constitutes the main source of income and provides food self-sufficiency for the family. For this reason, Bintou decided to become a farmer two years ago and she now grows groundnut on her plot of land. Like all farmers, however, she is faced with difficulties such as the lack of rain, the lack of high-quality fertilizers and herbicides. Bintou is starting her second year with myAgro. She decided to join again this year because of the high-quality seeds and high-quality fertilizers that she can purchase. This year, she is making payments to purchase a myAgro package of OPV (openly pollinated variety) seeds and some fertilizer to grow groundnut in order to increase her yield on her 0.0625 hectare plot of land.\r\n\r\nBintou has been growing groundnut for two years now for its nutritional value, since groundnut can be directly consumed by the family and is used as a staple sauce in many dishes.

Eight determined and hard-working women in the community have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Golondrinas\u201d or \u201cThe Swallows\u201d. The ladies began their Trust Bank two years ago and have invested their loans into various commercial endeavors including the sale of candles, beans, corn and vegetables. They are on their third loan cycle with Friendship Bridge and Kiva.\r\n\r\nThe Treasurer of the Trust Bank is 30 year old Ana who is married with two children. Ana began to work making candles when she was only 14 years old and now that she has more responsibilities, she has taken the business to a higher level. With her income, she is able to help her husband to keep the household afloat. With her new loan, she plans to purchase wax, wick material and other supplies. Her candles are in demand in the community and she wants to have plenty of inventory on hand.\r\n\r\nAna and her friends in the Trust Bank learn to value and empower themselves in the monthly educational trainings at their meetings. Through role playing, pictures and games, a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares useful information with the women about effective business practices, health, hygiene and self-esteem, as well as women\u2019s rights, goals and dreams. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of education and loans \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. Quite simply, it is very effective.\r\n\r\nKiva lenders play an important role for these women in providing capital for the loans. The ladies are most appreciative.
