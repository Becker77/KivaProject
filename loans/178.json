En tiempos de cosecha busca el apoyo de los jornaleros para que lo  apoyen en la extracci\u00f3n de los frutos. Sus frutos que mayor retabilidad le dan, son los granos de cacao y las hojas de coca, por lo que las empresas acopiadoras le remuneran muy bien por cada kilogramo. El problema de su trabajo radica en no poder combatir con los insectos quienes se encargan de da\u00f1ar los frutos de las plantas.

They have 4 children, who are their happiness.  They live in their own home in Manitea Alta.  Leoncio is a hard-working farmer who works with great effort to grow coffee, cacao and coca leaves, which he has done for the past 18 years through his own effort.  At harvest time he counts on the help of day laborers to bring the fruit crop in.  The crops which he gains most profit from are cacao and coca, as companies buy at good prices for each kilogram of produce.  A problem he faces is not being able to control insect pests that attack his fruit crop.  But his first priority is to buy more land to increase his production.  This is his 3rd loal from MFP, and he is ready to repay promptly, so as to be able to continue to have access to credit in the future.  He participates actively as a member of his communal lender. With 2,500 nuevos soles, he will buy coffee plants, to later graft them in order to produce fruit in a shorter time span.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":984099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-19T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leoncio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2558.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455483}],"funded_date":"2012-01-20T01:31:52Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matthew Cassetta","image":260079}},{"id":656714,"name":"Vida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"After graduating from middle school, Vida decided to set up a shop selling cosmetics and used children\u2019s wear in Abura, Cape Coast.

in 1977, Cecilia M. is married to Jonathan Suh and is a mother of 5 children. Her source of motivation is from difficulties she has faced, especially poor health which has resulted in a surgical operation on her leg. This further compounded the situation and the consequences include inability to educate her children even in primary school.\r\nEncouraged by GHAPE borrowers Cecilia became a member of GHAPE and received a loan of $40 in 2003 and since then has proven her ability to receive, invest and repay loans up to the amount of $400. From previous loans she provided her community with fresh food. She is very proud of her achievements especially her success in owning and managing her own business. With profits from these loans, she has been paying children\u2019s school fees. \r\nGiven a loan of $600, Cecilia plans to continue in the same line of business of selling water fufu and Eru and crop cultivation. Water-fufu is made out of fermented cassava. It is palatable with okra and Eru. Eru is green vegetables prepared with smoked fresh  cow skin. When crayfish is added to it and a few magi cubes, even passers-by smell it and saliva is generated. Water fufu and Eru was once a highly appreciated traditional dish in the south west province of Cameroon but today it is widely eaten by most Cameroonians. Her intention is to use the profit to continue to educate her children and take care of her health. Cecilia plans to repay her loan during the loan term."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":54123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"purchase of foodstuffs, hire labor, buy wood, transport expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Nkwen Market, NW.

Chinigul is an extremely hard-working and energetic woman. She is 47 years old. She is married and the loving mother of two children. <P>\r\n\r\nChinigul started her own business because her husband\u2019s salary was not enough for their family expenses. For more than 10 years, she has operated a store where she sells women\u2019s clothing and men\u2019s shirts. Her store is well known, and people love to visit because it's clean, tidy, and run by someone who is very kind and thoughtful. <P>\r\n\r\nChinigul hopes that her store will keep growing so that she can maintain a comfortable life for her family especially for her two children. To make that possible, she has applied for a new loan that she will use to buy more clothing to sell. With this purpose in mind,  Chinigul is requesting 2500 Somoni for a term of 9 months. She promises to repay the loan on time and thanks everyone supporting her.  <P>\r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With previous loans, she succeeded in providing her community with cooked food for their social activities. \n\nThis will be her third loan from GHAPE; she joined GHAPE in 2007. She has been quite successful in the past with her business due to her location in mile 11 Bambui, the quality of her food, and her reasonable prices. She has a strong customer base and is confident that she will be able to increase her sales. \n \nThe part of the profits from this loan will be used for the school fees of her children; the other part will be used to expand the business. Mary does not foresee a problem with her loan repayments. She intends to start repayment in the fourth month after taking the loan. \n\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

Her business is a small store where she sells a variety of products, which she started several years ago with money from her job as a cook.  She had invested in cosmetics and clothing, but later decided to create her store for which she has been investing in stock with the funding provided by the institution.    \r\n\r\nTo improve her store, her house is made of concrete although it still lacks a ground floor.  However, what she wants is to do is raise the roof a little more, since it is rather low and generates a lot of heat. For this reason, there is the need to put up walls in better condition.  For this, she will purchase blocks, cement, iron, wood, nails, and will began to do the work.  She is pleased that through these loans she is obtaining a better roof.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carrie Ting, Kiva

There are 11 members of the group; they took the name from a football team in their community where all the members meet each weekend.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Se\u00f1ora Rosa Amelia A. L, better known in the group as 'Rosi'. She was the group's treasurer for some time. Rosi tells us that she has 4 children - 7, 6, 2, and 3 months old. Her husband has worked as a chauffeur for 2 years in a transport company, where he drives from the Toluca terminal to the municipality of Xonocatlan. Rosi will use this loan to invest in the sale of cosmetics to her family and acquaintances. These loans allow her to obtain a better quality of life. As she has only studied up to primary school, her goal is that her children can one day study and be professionals and not have to abandon their studies, which is very common in this zone. \r\n\r\nAnother member of this group is Se\u00f1ora Rosa Mar\u00eda V\u00e1zquez G, who also works selling cosmetics. She has 4 children, only one of whom depends on her, and her daughter is se\u00f1ora Rosa Amelia V\u00e1zquez  G. She is seeking a loan to stock her business with cosmetics, which she sells to her acquaintances. Her major source of income is obtained in the company where she works, working with colleagues for a company called 'Mundo Dulce' (Sweet World), producing sweets. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT: Mar\u00eda Dolores C.

She is 41 years old and didn't finish her basic education through lack of financial resources as she had to work from a young age to help support her family.  Antonia sells products through catalogs.  She will use her loan to buy perfumes and cosmetics from catalogs (Jafra, Avon, Fuller).  She sells her products from house to house.  The products she sells most of are: perfumes, creams, utensils, make-up sets, lipsticks, eye liners, blusher, etc.  She has been in her business for 10 years.  At the beginning, her business was difficult because she had to supplement her income washing for other people or selling other types of products such as fruit and vegetables since initially her catalog sales were very low.  However, she gradually increased her number of customers and started committing herself solely to selling perfume and other items through catalogs.  She tells us that at the beginning necessity forced her to increase her sales as she was left alone with her children and she had to earn more to get them ahead in life.\r\n\r\nAntonia currently continues to make her sales from house to house but she has a good customer base and her income is secure each week.  She only works within her neighborhood.  She walks from house to house offering her products for sale.  This business activity is very important for her because it is how she makes her income to support her family.  The part of her work she enjoys the most is showing her catalogs to her customers and persuading them to buy her products.  She feels proud to be making the income she currently makes.  Thanks to her business, she has been able to get her children ahead in life without neglecting them.  She personally serves her customers who are young people and adults who buy her products and she is pleased that her business is well known by the people in her community.  Sometimes her children help her to deliver her orders.  One of the problems that Antonia has faced in her business is people who ask to buy on credit and then don't make their repayments on time.  For example, when there are graduation ceremonies or people are celebrating 'D\u00eda de los Muertos' (Day of the Dead), they delay their payments because they use the money for other expenses.  However, they pay her back bit by bit and she recovers the money she has invested.    Another challenge she has faced in her business is the competition from other people who make catalog sales but she already has a customer base tnanks to her good customer service.  She normally uses the money she makes to feed her family and to cover her children's school expenses.  In the future, she plans to set up a display window and display her products in her home.\r\n\r\nAntonia is single and has 4 children: 19 year-old Constantino who works, 16 year-old Agust\u00edn who works, 13 year-old Leonardo who is in high school and 22 year-old Patricia who is married.  Her children also help her in her business, delivering her orders.  Antonia would like to use the profits from her business and her Kiva loans to put a new roof on her house and to extend it, building two more rooms.  Her dream is for her business to remain stable and to increase it so that she has a well-established business.  She feels happy to be receiving this loan because it will enable her to achieve her goals and increase her sales.  Antonia would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"Thank you for putting your trust in me and I hope not to let you down.  I hope that you will continue helping more people who need it\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":681020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy Jafra, Avon and Fuller products and Estrella perfumes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SAN JUAN AHUEHUEYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-03T20:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia Romana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3061.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430787},{"amount":165,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2041.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850046},{"amount":165,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2041.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292319},{"amount":165,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2041.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160584},{"amount":82.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1020.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233492}],"funded_date":"2011-01-07T03:18:49Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":266888,"name":"Ekua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ekua N. is a single parent taking care of one child.

single. She is raising a teenage son on her own. Nataliya lives in Nikopol. She sells children\u2019s shoes. She has been in this business for 15 years. She says selling children\u2019s shoes is good because there is not much competition. However, this business too has its difficulties; for example, often part of her stock remains unclaimed and unsold. Nevertheless, Nataliya does not give up and spares no effort in developing her business. At the moment she has  stocked goods worth over 100,000  UAH.\r\n\r\nNataliya offers quality wares for every budget and taste, which means her wares are in demand  and she has loyal customers.

La esposa de un hermano le ense\u00f1\u00f3 a elaborar dulces de chocolate y Nora Elena vio una gran oportunidad de negocio, por lo que empez\u00f3 a elaborar los chocolates y a buscar venderlo por las tiendas de su sector. Al principio Nora Elena tuvo que superar grandes adversidades como la de conseguir un proveedor de calidad y de buenos precios, pero a Nora Elena no la aplac\u00f3 nada y consigui\u00f3 un excelente proveedor con excelentes precios. Ahora, Nora Elena comercializa sus productos por las tiendas de su sector y a algunos particulares les vende unas cantidades peque\u00f1as, a tal punto que a Nora Elena le hacen m\u00e1s pedidos de los que puede producir. Es por esto que Nora Elena comprar\u00e1 m\u00e1s moldes y m\u00e1s materia prima para la producci\u00f3n de sus chocolates, sin embargo, actualmente no tiene el capital disponible para ello puesto que sus clientes le pagan a cr\u00e9dito, por lo que Nora Elena aspira a que con un pr\u00e9stamo pueda adquirir los moldes y la materia prima que necesita y su negocio siga creciendo para que genere mas ingresos. \n\nNora Elena tiene un gran sue\u00f1o y es el de tener una gran f\u00e1brica de dulces, y que su hijo de 10 a\u00f1os pueda heredar todo lo que ella con tanto esfuerzo ha buscado. Adem\u00e1s, Nora Elena aspira a generar empleo muy pronto, y contratar a personas de bajos recursos que requieran de unos ingresos, as\u00ed le mejorar\u00e1 la calidad de vida tanto a su hijo como a las dem\u00e1s personas que lo necesiten.\n","en":"The best way to describe Nora Elena is \"entrepreneur.\" Her sister-in-law taught her to make chocolate candies and Nora Elena saw a great business opportunity, so she began to make chocolates and found stores in her area where she could sell them. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning, Nora Elena had to overcome great adversities, such as finding a supplier with quality goods and good prices, but Nora Elena refused to give up, and found an excellent supplier with excellent prices. Now Nora Elena markets her products in the local stores and sells a few to individuals, to the point where Nora Elena has more orders than she can fill. This is why Nora Elena wants to purchase more molds and raw materials for producing her chocolates, however right now she doesn't have the necessary capital for this since her customers pay her on credit. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Nora Elena's goal is to acquire the molds and raw materials she needs, and to continue the growth of her business in order to generate more income. Nora Elena's grand dream is to have a large chocolate factory, and for her 10 year old son to be able to inherit everything she has built through so much effort. In addition, Nora Elena hopes very soon to create jobs, and to hire people of little means who need some income. In this way she will improve her son's quality of life, as well as that of other people who need

He travels to diverse places like a missionary, teaching the Bible.  He does this without neglecting his activities as a farmer and, thanks to the aid of his wife, he can carry out his multiple tasks.  Demetrio travels constantly, but the great majority of the days of the month he spends with his family in his fields.  We find them on the outskirts of his home, extending the coffee crop.  He hopes that the prices of coffee will improve so that he can obtain better profits.  Similarly, he hopes to increase his production and for this, he requests this loan. He will invest in his coffee plantations, so that, with the improvement of his income, he can have the opportunity to offer higher education to his three daughters and also to continue travelling carrying the word of God to the people.  We hope that you can offer him the necessary support to do well.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":213268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To invest in his coffee plantation.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more cosmetics and resell them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T20:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jafelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027595},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613596},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010675},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232961},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664752},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105472},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022617},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867866},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757067},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146179}],"funded_date":"2009-03-10T03:28:30Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Adam Sutcliffe","image":null}},{"id":98067,"name":"Margoth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia MARGOTH;

Mahmud is 24-years old. He is married with two kids. Over the years he has tried various types of activities. Finally, two years ago, he started his business selling cell phones. Mahmud finds this business to be profitable and the generated income allows him to support his family. However, Mahmud thinks that it is overly expensive to purchase the cell phones locally and it would cut expenses considerably if the goods were purchased in China. With this in mind, Mahmud requests a loan of $800 US with a term of nine months. This is his first loan and Mahmud is grateful to all for supporting him. He promises to repay the loan promptly. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n<br>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history. It was a key post along the Silk Road and prominent at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History:\r\n<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

sector of the Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz district 5 minutes from the city of Chiclayo. \r\n\r\nFor 15 years she has had a small place on the exterior of the Model Market of Chiclayo (the main city market) where she sells under garments.  She buys her goods in the city shops that offer these products to her wholesale and sells them every day during the mornings, afternoons, and even at night.  This business has served to support her family during this time.  Thanks to her work effort, her first three children are studying technical careers, while the youngest continues studying at a secondary school.  She gives the best to mover her children forward as she is aware that their future depends on the education she can provide them. \r\n\r\nDora is requesting a 2000 nuevos soles loan that she plans to invest in the purchase of more goods to keep her business and continue to support her children.  Her biggest dream is to obtain a place in the interior of the market so that she can continue offering her products because the current place does not offer her the security she needs to work peacefully.  She has already worked with us previously, showing responsibility and timeliness in her payments, so is considered a good client.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pamela Reynolds, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":383738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase goods to maintain her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ort\u00edz -

Penina is now requesting a loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment.  This will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Penina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

They live in their own wooden house located in the tropical rainforest in the community of Sirenachayocc in the Cusco area. \r\n\r\nAt the age of 20, Edilberta was already a skilled farmer and knew how to care for her cocoa plantations. Nevertheless, there were difficult times for her and her family as there were no buyers in her community because of the constant landslides in the area. As a result she lost her investment.\r\n\r\nThe following two years were spent paying back the money she owed to suppliers and workers. Over time she got her life back on track and returned to farming, but this time she planted coffee. From this moment on, her sales increased, more than in other years, and she already has future orders from her customers. As a result much is demanded of her if she is to fill the orders efficiently.\r\n\r\nGenerally she and her husband do the work, but at harvest time she needs extra hands to speed things up. Normally her products are sold to warehouses in her community. In the future Edilberta plans to buy more land on which to grow citrus fruits and broaden her product base. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Kiva partner MFP and she promises to make the repayments. She is also confident that she will get far with her communal group because it offers many benefits. With the loan she will buy quality supplies and fertilizer  so she can provide appropriate care for her fields of cocoa and coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":549416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies and fertilizer for her cocoa and coffee fields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-08T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edilberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":149.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":161.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":163.07},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":169.02},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":176.57},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":182.8},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":190.2},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":195.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":202.87},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":209.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.02},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.18},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.89},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.03},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.76},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.01},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.69},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.51},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.02,"local_amount":149.58,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":154.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934590},{"amount":58.18,"local_amount":161.13,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":166.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673361},{"amount":58.89,"local_amount":163.07,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":168.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887185},{"amount":61.03,"local_amount":169.02,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:27Z","rounded_local_amount":175.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154197},{"amount":63.76,"local_amount":176.57,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":182.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449506},{"amount":66.01,"local_amount":182.8,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":189.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588186},{"amount":68.69,"local_amount":190.2,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:35Z","rounded_local_amount":196.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724733},{"amount":70.51,"local_amount":195.25,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":202.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462945},{"amount":73.25,"local_amount":202.87,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":210.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886458},{"amount":75.66,"local_amount":209.51,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":216.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326763}],"funded_date":"2010-06-09T08:05:14Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":209537,"name":"Yulita's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yulita E. is from the village of Sibutad.

She has increased the services she is able to offer, including assessing clients and selling beauty products and providing hair cuts to compliment the appearance of women, men and children. She is a woman that lives in Malambo with her three children aged 20 and 25 years old. \r\n\r\nWhen she was 25 years old and still living in Santa Maria she learned to provide beauty services to women, so when she moved to Barranquilla she immediately thought about setting a business to generate an income, a business doing something she enjoys. Fifteen years ago she set up her  \r\nbusiness selling beauty products, door to door, giving hair cuts, dying hair, hair styling for events et. Gradually her clients sought out her advice on the products they should be using to have healthy hair, keeping it the same way as when they left Nuris' shop. She started selling to her clientele beauty products, engaging another source of income. She continued to offer her beauty services. Thanks to the efforts she invested in her business and her husband's efforts, a very hard working person too, she has granted her children to have higher education. They are all enjoying careers now. \r\n\r\nThis is the third loan accessed through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). With her loan she will purchase beauty products such as shampoo, streaks, massage oils, conditioners etc. With previous loans invested she has seen improvement in her profits, and she has improved  \r\nthe quality of their house. She has also increased the services she is able to offer. Her dream is to remodel her beauty shop and carry out some home improvements. Her greatest challenge now is facing rainy days because it becomes difficult for her to provide her services at their clients' homes. The rains come in terrible storms that come almost daily. The rivers swell and the entire city is paralyzed because it is dangerous to go out of the home. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Samwel will invest in livestock rearing and will use the same for loan repayment. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Ng'oli Associates group will each plant  between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nPicture:  \r\nSamwel is pictured with his group members in the photograph.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":891813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs such as seeds and fertilizer at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-10-25T14:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samwel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roseline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Protus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":53900,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":53900,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":54916.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680512}],"funded_date":"2011-10-25T19:42:26Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":352996,"name":"Mariam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariam is married and blessed with 2 young children, both of which are currently enrolled in school.

The businesses are located mainly in the city of El Seybo, a farming community in the northeast of the country.\r\n\r\nLuisa makes her home in a simple structure with her two children. She tells us that her most difficult challenge is to raise her children and educate them, even while she is working and taking income home. Her children are attending school while she is walking around in different communities selling her products. She enjoys being at her home. She sells miscellaneous products like clothes, shoes, underwear and cosmetics. This loan, her 5th, will be used to buy more of these items to sell. \r\n\r\nLuisa has repaid her previous four loans satisfactorily and is taking an important step towards her business\u2019s growth. At the beginning she thought this loan could be good for capital, and now she loves the program and likes to share with all the members.

\u0110\u00e3ng invested all the loans that she received in her metal waste recycling business and chicken farm. Her daily revenue from the waste recycling business brought in 4-5 USD. Her husband and 5 children took care of the chicken farm. When she was approaching the age of 50, the hard labor of the metal waste recycling business started to take its toll on Ms \u0110\u00e3ng's health. So she and her husband had decided to abandon this waste recycling business and concentrate their effort on exploiting a farm. In 2000, she bought 1 acre of land for cultivation and fish farming.

Thi Vy is 36 years old. Before joining the fund, her family's financial situation was difficult because the main source of their income came totally from farming. The first loan with TYM was for 180.00 USD and she invested in her business of selling mats. Since then, the family's income has improved. In the process of shopping, she and her husband notice the production of rubber bands as a new craft, and there is a demand for them in the market. With that thought, they decided to change direction of their business. With the money they have saved combined with a loan from TYM fund, they were able to purchase a rubber band cutting machine. Presently the business is doing very well, with average daily income of 12.00 USD. For this loan, she wishes to borrow 550.00 USD. Average monthly income is 360.00 USD  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Thu Ostrander, Kiva

She began this business in 2005 in the Adidogom\u00e9 district of Lom\u00e9. This business allows her, among other things, to provide for her family. She criss-crosses through many villages and areas in Togo searching for these traditional pearls, which are rare these days. She also supplies herself in Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso. She sells her goods most often to European and American tourists visiting Togo; she has contracts with young salesmen who bring these tourists to her house; she buys the pearls and sets them herself. She currently needs to purchase certain items; it is for this reason that she is seeking a loan through WAGES (one of Kiva's field partners) to buy thread and to order more pearls in bulk.

S.L.M.B Primary school Maroc was built primarily for the purpose of Quranic reading, but later was transformed into English and Arabic learning. Presently, there are 20 teachers in the school and 705 pupils. S.L.M.B always makes good grades in public exams (The National Primary School Examinations-NPSE) and does well in sports. The school has produced a lot of highly qualified and trained professionals in all walks of life who are living and working in and outside of Sierra Leone.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan S.L.M.B is accessing from Kiva through SMT. School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone.

T. (1) is a 61-year-old female living in the town of Thanh Hoa.  Minh is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 08.03.01 Dong Ve (08.03.01 Dong Ve).\n\n\nMinh is married and has no children.  To make a living, Minh works in a family member's business making and selling snacks & other delicacies in the local community.  Minh has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 1,500,000 VND a month from these activities.\n\n\nIn 2010, Minh joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Minh is requesting her first loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  She is requesting a loan of 4,248,000 VND, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Minh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\n\n\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\n\n\n1.  T. T. Nga (2) is a 34-year-old female who is requesting a 4,248,000 VND loan to support her service-based business.\n\n\n2.  B. T. Hang (3) is a 31-year-old female who is requesting a 4,248,000 VND loan to support her service-based business.\n\n\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women:\n\nThe mission of Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province.\n\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\nMinh N.

Most people here farm and raise livestock.\r\n\r\nHere we meet 35 year-old Nora who is married and has three children.  Two of her children are in high school and her youngest is in elementary school.  Nora's husband is a teacher.\r\n\r\nNora sells Esika and Yanbal products (beauty products, perfume and ladies' accessories).  She works three or four days a week.

This is 52-year-old Mwashabani M.. She is married with four children, who are between 22 and 30 years old, and she has one other dependent, her niece. In 2007, Mwashabani established a poultry business, and she now seeks a loan in order to purchase additional chickens to raise and sell. She thanks you for your support.\r\n<p>\r\nRaising \"kuku\" is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. You may ask, \"who or what are 'kuku'\"? Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital, so you can start with one or two and either add to them as the business grows or wait until they multiple naturally! Second, they require little space. Third, they produce eggs when they grow, and the eggs can either be sold (to provide additional income) or eaten (to provide a supplementary source of protein). \r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through sale and leaseback arrangements. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. Accordingly, most women in Tanzania receive poor financial support and, as such, have very little income to provide for their basic needs and services. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. In practice, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women; specifically, in a SELFINA sale and leaseback transaction, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from that client (to provide the client with cash flow) and then leases the equipment back to her so that she can continue to use the

Sancha says that she particularly needs to buy comfortable, affordable sandal-style shoes and more rice, as these are the most popular items in her shop.\r\n\r\nSancha has two daughters, one son and a husband, all of whom help her out in the shop. Sancha says that she and her husband make all of their business decisions together, including the decision to take out a Kiva loan.\r\n\r\nIn the future Sancha hopes that she can continue to expand her business and begin supplying stock to smaller shops in the area. She would like to be able to provide her children with a very good quality education so that they can pursue whichever career they think will make them

The residents engage in agriculture, primarily the cultivation of corn and vegetables.  The area is well-known for its colorful festivals, traditional music, local customs (such as climbing the grease pole), fireworks, and numerous attractions that bring in domestic and foreign tourists.  The Communal Bank consists of members who are related to one another.  They are looking for new ways to be productive and generate income so that their families can have a better quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Flor F. D. is a member of the Vegaspamba Communal Bank.  She lives in the San Joaquin Parrish located on the outskirts of Cuenca.  She is 32 years old and has been separated from her husband for four years as a result of misunderstandings and a lack of communication.  Flor is the mother of seven children ranging in age from 3 to 17.  Her oldest daughter works as a housekeeper in order to help with the household expenses.  The other children are students in either elementary or secondary school.  Only her nine year old son lives with his grandmother in the community of Vegaspamba.  Flor\u2019s house is made only of boards and sheets of zinc.\r\n<p>\r\nFlor is engaged in agriculture, planting all types of vegetables so that she can sell them at the open fair or in the markets of Cuenca.  She has been farming for many years since she learned the trade from her parents.  Her work begins every day at 4am.  On Wednesdays and Saturdays, she travels to the fair.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth cycle working with the Institution.  She used her previous loans to purchase seeds for planting crops.  Flor also received training on how to save money.  With this new loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, she will purchase seeds for growing lettuce, tomatoes, spinach, carrots, broccoli, and other vegetables.  Part of the money will be used to buy school supplies for her children.\r\n<p>\r\nHer goal is to increase her crop output and improve her financial situation so that her children can have a better future.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Rosa D. is also a member of the Vegaspamba Communal Bank and lives in the community of the same name.  She is 57 years old and has been separated for 18 years when her husband abandoned the family.  Rosa has six children, all of whom are married.  Her home is a result of all the hard work she has performed since she was a young woman.  Rosa currently lives with her grandson, who attends school in Vegaspamba.  He is the only person who provides her company.\r\n<p>\r\nRosa produces handmade sweaters.  She took up weaving six years ago when friends from the neighborhood taught her this skill.  Rosa now instructs other women how to start this type of business in their own communities.  The women she teaches produce mainly nylon bags.\r\n<p>\r\nRosa is participating in her fourth cycle with the Foundation.  She says that her previous loans were a great help because they enabled her to maintain her business.  With this new loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, she will purchase bags for her business and some food for household consumption.\r\n<p>\r\nRosa hopes to remain financially stable.\r\n<br

St. Denis Makondo Boarding School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining two UV water filtration systems to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of their budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing two water filtration systems will therefore save the schools money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase two UV water treatment systems with two 450 litre tanks, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nSt. Denis Makondo Boarding School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Julia ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2049593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Masaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"St. Denis Makondo Boarding School","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4348300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":869660},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":869660},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":869660},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":869660},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":869660}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":265},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":3883,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>JOHN B. is an O-level leaver, married with four children.

They live in their own home.  \r\n\r\nFive years ago she had the idea of buying a truck load of coal and selling it.  Ever since, she stocks her main buyers on a weekly basis.  Her buyers are the many small factories that make bricks in her area.  They use it for fuel in their condensation ovens.  During the rainy season, there is not as much demand, which is why it\u2019s important to have a warehouse.  This business has been good so she is constantly buying stone coal and storing it on her home's patio.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Antonia would like to continue working in this field, but she would like to buy in bigger quantities.  This is her first loan with MFP, and she would like to work harmoniously with the other members of the group.  The loan will be very useful to Antonia as she is planning to buy a load of stone coal to stock up.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva

Es el mayor de 3 hermanos, vive en la casa de sus padres apoy\u00e1ndolos en los trabajos agr\u00edcolas. Cuando obtuvo la mayor\u00eda de edad (18 a\u00f1os) se dio cuenta de que ten\u00eda que trabajar duro en las chacras de su padre para ayudar a mejorar la econom\u00eda de su casa, en vista de que les faltaba dinero para cubrir la educaci\u00f3n de sus hermanas menores. Desde entonces se levanta muy temprano para que a las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana ya est\u00e9 trabajando en sus cultivos. Durante los meses de verano inicia su labor removiendo la tierra y prepar\u00e1ndola para las siembras del nuevo a\u00f1o; llegada la temporada de sembrar cava los surcos donde se entierra la papa. Esta din\u00e1mica de trabajo la realiza con el valioso apoyo de su padre, pero para los meses de cosecha su madre y sus hermanas se suman a la faena, recogiendo la papa y seleccion\u00e1ndola por tama\u00f1o para despu\u00e9s enviarla al mercado de la ciudad de Tarma. Esta cosecha le result\u00f3 muy rentable, puesto que vendi\u00f3 cada saco de papa entre 70 a 80 soles, reuniendo dinero para las necesidades de sus hermanas y otra parte para su pr\u00f3xima siembra. Roly est\u00e1 feliz con su trabajo, ama sus cultivos y se siente \u00fatil para su hogar. Este es su cuarto cr\u00e9dito con MFP, durante los 3 ciclos anteriores demostr\u00f3 pagar puntualmente, y en este pr\u00e9stamo reitera su compromiso. Roly es el secretario de su banco comunal, por ello que en cada reuni\u00f3n anota los acuerdos en el libro de actas. El dinero que solicita es para la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos y pesticidas para el follaje de las hojas de sus plantas de papa. ","en":"Roly is 22-years old and single; he is a very noble and hard working young man. He is the eldest of 3 brothers and lives in his parents' house, helping them with farming work. When he came of age (18-years old) he realized he had to work hard on his father's farm to help improve his family's financial situation, considering that they don't have money to cover his younger brothers' schooling. Since then, Roly gets up very early so that by 8:00 a.m. he is already working his crops. \r\n\r\nDuring the summer he starts turning over the soil and preparing it for next season's planting. It is now time to plow the furrows where he will plant potatoes. Roly accomplishes this work with the valuable help of his father, but during the harvest his mother and sisters join him to work on the land, picking the potatoes and sorting them by size to send to the market in Tarma city.\r\n\r\nThis harvest turned out very profitable, since he sold each sack of potatoes at 70 to 80 PEN. He put the money towards meeting the needs of his sisters, also setting aside a portion for the next planting season. Roly is happy with his work; he loves his crops and feels useful in his home. This is his fourth loan with MFP. In his prior loans he demonstrated that he makes his repayments punctually, and in this loan he will again follow through on his commitment. Roly is the secretary of his community bank, so he records minutes for each meeting in the group's log book (Libro de Actas). The money he requests is to buy chemical fertilizers and pesticides for his potato plants.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":343822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fertilizers and pesticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-27T18:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roly","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2520.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717166}],"funded_date":"2009-06-27T22:45:26Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":122691,"name":"Delfina De La Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Delfina naci\u00f3 en agua blanca Jutiapa el 12 de octubre de 1,958 tiene 50 a\u00f1os de edad y 5 hijos 4 varones y una mujer el mayor tiene 30 a\u00f1os y la menor tiene 22 el mayor de sus hijos ya es casado y los menores viven con ella, el esposo de do\u00f1a Delfina se fue al extranjero para poder ayudar con el estudio de sus hijos y les manda remesas hace 8 a\u00f1os inicio su negocio de tortillas con 1 arroba de ma\u00edz y  torteaba con le\u00f1a as\u00ed fue subiendo su ingreso y aumentando clientes, actualmente tortea con 1 quintal de ma\u00edz diario y  utiliza gas propano solicita un pr\u00e9stamo de Q7,000.00, para comprar una estufa industrial y un fog\u00f3n para coser su ma\u00edz y de esa manera generar mas ingresos.","en":"Delfina was born in Agua Blanca Jutiapa on October 12, 1958 and is 50 years old.

Their adult son was already living in South Florida and had started a business.  He employed his father and the two of them took care of the household expenses and Maria\u2019s bills.  \r\n\r\nDespite their support, Maria wanted to contribute to the household finances and keep herself busy. She was always been good at sewing. Two years ago, little by little, she started to develop a small client\u00e8le that used her services for clothing alterations. She was proud of her small business, but her sewing machine started to fail due to overuse.  \r\n\r\nMaria learned about ACCION USA\u2019s lending program and applied for a loan to buy two new sewing machines.  With this loan, Maria was able to invest in her business, and also establish a credit history. She paid her loan off perfectly and would now like a larger loan to make additional investments in her business.  \r\n\r\nA local factory wants to contract for her services, which would proviD. her with consistent work. Another business owner, who currently imports bathing suits, wants Maria to hand-make the swimwear for them. In order to sign these contracts, Maria would need an embroidery machine and a digital sewing machine to create her own designs. She will also need to purchase more inventory to maintain a more sizeable stock. For example, now, if she doesn't have the right color zipper, she has to take the bus downtown, incurring a $4 round-trip fare and more than 2 hours of her time.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Maria works in her quaint, one-bedroom apartment in Miami Beach. She hopes to be able to expand her business so she can rent a modest storefront where her customers can stop by and drop off items that need to be mended.  \r\n\r\nShe is a very friendly person who always has a smile on her face. She loves to visit with people and to get to know her regular customers. In her own space, she can welcome clients and, hopefully, hire a helper, too.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":360243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"An

Kupang District of East Nusa Tenggara. Tunbaun is situated about 23 kilometres from Kupang City. Most of the village community consumes corn and cassava as their staple food. The agricultural products also generate money for their family needs. The agricultural products are sold at Baun Market in the nearest neighboring village and also in Inpres Market in Kupang City. The view surrounding the village is beautiful as many trees and wild flowers grow well in the rainy season. The village seems green.\r\n\r\nKisan A Group is led by Damaris Runisi.  She is a 47 year-old farmer. She is married to a farmer from her village and their marriage has been blessed with three children. They are:\r\n- Devri Runisi, 17 \u2013 who is now working in Jakarta;\r\n- Dance Runisi, 14  \u2013 he did not complete elementary school and spends his days helping his parents on the farm;\r\n- Ayub Runisi, 10, who is in the fourth grade of Elementary School. \r\n\r\nDamaris is a good mother to her children and her life is dedicated to her family. She usually starts her day at five am.  She prepares breakfast for her children and husband and helps Ayub in preparing himself to go to school. Damaris has to walk about one kilometre to reach a spring in order to get water for washing and cooking. Using two buckets, Damaris carries the water on her shoulders. After completing her work at home she goes to the farm to help her husband. They usually spend about six hours on the farm. They plant coconut, betel vine and bananas and sell them in Inpres Market once a week. They also plant peanuts, peas, cassavas and corn in the rainy season. To generate more income, Damaris\u2019 husband also buys vegetables and fruits from other farmers and resells them at the market. Damaris used to own another farm but because of landslide lost her land. As a result, she and her family can only depend on their current farm.\r\n\r\nAs the mother of three children, Damaris is concerned about her family. Her husband is a hard worker but the income he generates is only just enough to support their family needs. This is the reason that motivated Damaris to find another way to support her family. She heard about the TLM cattle fattening program and would like to join it.  Together with other farmers also interested in joining the program, they formed Kisan A Group to apply for the loan. Damaris is requesting a loan of IDR 3,300,000 to buy a calf to fatten over a 12 month period. The other group members are also requesting the same loan. All of them have the same goal:  to improve their lives.\r\n\r\nNote: Melinda was not present when the group picture was taken.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":453516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a calf.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Tunbaun","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T12:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Damaris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Debora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nofri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Septiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fransina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":26400000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":26400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2800,"local_amount":26400000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":26516000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244659039}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T20:15:13Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T11:16:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emina Tudakovic","image":825486}},{"id":168039,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a 45-year-old married mother of four children, all of whom are in school.

Teresa operates a general store, and her husband helps her in her business activities. \r\n\r\nTeresa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 cycle loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teresa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 49,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, and lifted the family's standard of living. Her 11th cycle loan of PHP 29,500 will be used as additional capital to expand her business. Her earnings will help her save up for the future, meet monthly household expenses, and do house repair. Teresa C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Con este dinero compr\u00f3 mercanc\u00eda y le dio m\u00e1s impulso a su   negocio, por lo cual considera que \u201cpagar con puntualidad las cuotas pactadas y no quedar mal es primordial para seguir adelante apoyada por esta organizaci\u00f3n, o por quienes le den la mano\u201d. Su negocio ha sido un pelda\u00f1o importante para su  vida y la de su familia, porque todos han puesto su granito de arena para sacarlo adelante. En el  negocio Gladys vende papeler\u00eda, detalles, ropa de ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as, peque\u00f1os electrodom\u00e9sticos, refrescos, cervezas y con sus ganancias ha logrado ayudar a formar profesionalmente a su hija hasta terminar su carrera de Contadur\u00eda P\u00fablica como tambi\u00e9n a mejorar las condiciones de su vivienda.    Gladys   se siente  muy contenta ella goza  d\u00e1ndole gracias a Dios y a la Fundaci\u00f3n por los beneficio recibidos y la confianza de esta al otorgarle prestamos consecutivos a los largo de 18 a\u00f1os, por su  buen manejo de responsabilidad y sentido de pertenencia.  Gladys considera que a lo largo  de todos estos a\u00f1os, la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo ha sido muy enriquecedora con sus capacitaciones y su apoyo econ\u00f3mico para el crecimiento y el buen manejo del negocio, tanto en la parte espiritual como material, porque esto le ha servido para encontrarse en paz con Dios y expresar agradecimientos a  la fundaci\u00f3n, y a  las personas que de una u otra forma le han colaborado para que los resultados sean positivos. Con los cursos de formaci\u00f3n microempresarial en los que ha participado, aprendi\u00f3 a distinguir entre clientes buenos y malos, as\u00ed como mercanc\u00edas que son m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil de vender y otras no, a ser ordenada con los recaudos y a tener una visi\u00f3n  diferente con respecto a los proveedores, ya que no es muy partidaria de adquirir mercanc\u00edas a cr\u00e9dito, sino comprarlas con el efectivo por lo que manifiesta que le deja un mayor margen de utilidad.\nEn la actualidad ha logrado conformar en sociedad una Cooperativa Multiactiva que se encuentra legalizada en la c\u00e1mara de comercio, producto de los conocimientos adquiridos en el largo recorrido de su carrera como microempresaria, y de los  ofrecidos por la fundaci\u00f3n que han sido muy importante y de  apoyo para alcanzar  sus metas y consolidar este , su proyecto de vida.  \nGladys es una mujer trabajadora y carism\u00e1tica que se desempe\u00f1a como docente en un Hogar Infantil,  ubicado en sur occidente de la ciudad donde se atienden Ni\u00f1os de escasos recursos. De su grupo inicial \u201c Las Kenesianas\u201d la \u00fanica que ha permanecido consecutivamente es   Gladys, porque es persistente y disciplinada, ella es una mujer felizmente realizada y a punto de recibir su  pensi\u00f3n.\nEn la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a su credikiva que es el financiamiento n\u00famero 22 y con el piensa comprar mercanc\u00edas para surtir su negocio en la \u00e9poca mas linda porque concentra a la familia en su hogar con festividades mientras lucen vestidos, calzados, accesorios y perfumes que Gladys vende a cr\u00e9dito y de contado.\nSu desaf\u00edo y meta principal es dedicarse completamente a la cooperativa multiactiva, as\u00ed  como tambi\u00e9n a su familia y a sus nietos, futuros herederos del negocio que con mucha disciplina, esfuerzo y trabajo ha levantado.\n \n\n\n\n","en":"Gladys Narva\u00e9z is a very active and dynamic person who likes business a lot.  This is a characteristic of her ancestors and she learned it almost instinctively.  Gladys is a saleswoman.  Initially she sold merchandise which her work colleagues and employees of other businesses ordered.  She also performed sewing tasks, her speciality being making clothes for little girls.  This period was very difficult for her because her two children were young and her income was very small.  However, one day some friends talked to her about Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she became interested.  Together with three friends, she set up the 'Las Kenesianas' solidarity group and they received their first loan for 60,000 Colombian pesos which was to be repaid over 4 instalments.  With this money, she bought merchandise and it gave her business a boost.  She considers that \u201cpaying your instalments punctually and not making a bad impression is essential if you want to continue to get ahead with the support of this organization or those who are giving you a hand\u201d.  \r\n\r\nGladys' business has been an important stepping stone in her life and that of her family because everybody has done their bit to get her business ahead.  In her business, Gladys sells stationery, notions, boys' and girls' clothing, small domestic appliances, soft drinks, beer and, with her profits, she has managed to help train her daughter professionally until she finished her course in Public Accountancy.  It has also helped her to improve the condition of her home.  Gladys feels very happy.  She gives thanks to God and Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for the benefits which she has received and the trust that the organization has placed in her by giving her consecutive loans for 18 years, for their good management, responsibility and sense of belonging.  Gladys considers that throughout all these years, being a part of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo has been a very enriching experience with their training programs and their financial support.  They have helped her business to grow and helped her to manage it well, both spiritually and materially.  This has helped her to find herself at peace with God and she is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and the people who in one way or another have contributed to her positive results.  Through the small business courses which she has participated in, she has learned to distinguish between good customers and bad customers as well as between goods which are easy to sell and others which are not.  She is now organized in her accounts and has a different view with respect to her providers since she is no longer a fan of acquiring goods on credit, rather she prefers to buy in cash because she says that this gives her a bigger profit margin.\r\n\r\nShe has currently managed to form a Multiactive Cooperative which has been legalized in the Chamber of Commerce.  This is a product of the knowledge which she has acquired throughout her long career as a small businesswoman.  The training she has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo has been very important and has supported her so that she can achieve her goals and consolidate her life's project.\r\n\r\nGladys is a hard-working and charismatic woman who works as a teacher in a child development center located in the south-west of the city where she looks after children whose parents have low economic means.  From her initial 'Las Kenesianas' group, the only one who has remained consecutively is Gladys because she is persistent and disciplined.  She is a woman who feels happily fulfilled and is about to receive her pension.  She is currently applying for her Kiva loan, which is her 22nd loan, and plans to use it to buy merchandise to stock her business in this period of the year which is the most beautiful because she gets her family together in her home and gets to enjoy the festive season while everyone shows off dresses, shoes, accessories and perfumes which Gladys sells on credit and for cash.\r\n\r\nGlady's challenge and main goal is to dedicate herself entirely to the multiactive cooperative as well as to her family and her grandchildren who are the future heirs to her business which she has built up with a lot of discipline, effort and hard work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":656909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy merchandise to stock her business in this most beautiful of seasons when her family gets together in her home to celebrate the festive season whilst they show off dresses , shoes, accessories and perfumes which Gladys sells on credit or for cash","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-12-02T23:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":151936},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":154468},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":157042},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":159660},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":162321},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":165026},{"due_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":167777},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":170573},{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":173416},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":176306},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":179244},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":182231}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.77},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.09},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.45},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.82},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.22},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.64},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.08},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.55},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.04},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.1},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.77,"local_amount":151936,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":153949.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427732},{"amount":81.09,"local_amount":154468,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:38Z","rounded_local_amount":156514.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001154},{"amount":82.45,"local_amount":157042,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":159122.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289165},{"amount":83.82,"local_amount":159660,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":161775.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157307},{"amount":85.22,"local_amount":162321,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:05Z","rounded_local_amount":164471.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230319},{"amount":637.65,"local_amount":1214573,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1230666.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509186}],"funded_date":"2010-12-21T04:08:19Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":258759,"name":"Rosa De Los Angeles","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa de 23 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en El Transito departamento de San Miguel, vive con su t\u00eda quien la creci\u00f3, Rosa est\u00e1 soltera y viven en casa propia.

She lives with her partner, Luis, who operates a sawmill. She lives with her father, mother, three siblings, her daughter, who is three years old, and her partner, all of them comfortably installed in the house of her parents.\r\n\r\nMarlene's business is the sale of soft drinks, which she does in the house of her parents, relying on a refrigerator that she bought with the help of her partner. She began this business on her own initiative, since she could see the economic needs her partner was experiencing and that his income was not sufficient. Now, after five years with her business, she has succeeded in making it grow and in having a larger volume of merchandise in her house. She relies on the help of her mother to tend to the customers only when she is out of the house.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business since it allows her to be at home to tend to and take care of her little child, to whom she wants to be able to offer a better quality of life.

He needs to do this because when the rainy season comes, he wants to protect his family so that he will be able to continue to work and exert himself in order to achieve his greatest dream: to become a great professional."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1312237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to make some improvements to his house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ginder Gilberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.08},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":109.02},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":109.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":117.24},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":122.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":130.73},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":132.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":140.64},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":143.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":149.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":161.12},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":169.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":173.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":181.94},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":187.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":195.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":203.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":209.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.21},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.26},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.59},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":697867,"name":"Juan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan tiene 70 a\u00f1os, es casado con Juaquina y tiene 4 hijos quienes son ya mayores e independientes.
