He is an intelligent, purposeful person who always thinks about his family, since he loves his wife and his children, who are all men like their father. His oldest son resembles him and is also an independent guy who loves his family and is working abroad in order to help provide for them all. \r\n\r\nOrtik works in his region in animal husbandry, having followed in the footsteps of his own father, who also worked in this kind of business. He has been raising cattle on his property for two years already. He buys cattle, fattens them over a certain amount of time and then resells them at the market. \r\n\r\nOrtik is looking for a loan so he can expand his business. He thinks that he has enough experience and it's time to bring the business to a new level. He wants to use the loan amount to buy a few head of cattle.

The ladies share that their businesses have improved with their first loan and they are requesting a second loan that they hope will be funded by Kiva lenders. The majority of the women work creating and selling the beautiful traditional textiles of the area that enjoy great demand, especially from admiring tourists.\r\n\r\nRafaela is a multi-tasking 49 year old member of the Trust Bank. She has two children and as a widow, is the sole breadwinner of the family. She has a traditional textile business and sells colorful blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d as well as tablecloths and napkins. Rafaela has a second business raising animals including chickens and pigs. She is requesting a loan to buy thread and supplies for her textile business so that she has plenty of inventory for her customers. And of course, her animals need feed as well.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that she has not had any formal schooling Rafaela understands the importance of education both for her children and herself. At the monthly meetings of the Trust Bank, the ladies meet with a Friendship Bridge Facilitator who shares pertinent information with the ladies in their own indigenous language about a variety of subjects. They gain valuable business tools learning about budgeting, pricing, accounting, marketing and customer service. The women learn to identify their goals and dreams and begin to understand the steps to make them a reality.

She has two children who inspire her daily to work hard and succeed. She has a small plot of land where she has planted bushes and trees bearing bananas, plantains, papayas, and coffee. Claudia is requesting a loan that she will use to maintain her fruit trees and also purchase necessary items for coffee plantings.\r\n\r\nThe women gather together each month to transact business on their small loans. In addition, they learn about relevant subjects that support them in their personal and business lives. The Facilitator from Friendship Bridge, speaking with the women in their own indigenous language, shares information with them about how to manage their loans and small businesses effectively (budgeting, accounting, marketing, customer service). They also learn how to support their families in a healthy way as they learn about nutrition, good hygiene, the use of medicinal plants and healthy habits. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of education and loans \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\r\n\r\nClaudia and her friends in the Trust Bank are appreciative to Kiva lenders for funding these essential loans.

She is a responsible and loving wife. For 8 years, she has worked at her own business, a beauty salon that she started on her own initiative as an alternative for earning income that will allow her to care for her family's wellbeing. She works every day for 5 hours.   \r\n\r\nShe learned this activity taking classes at a beauty academy and little by little she acquired more knowledge and perfected her techniques. This has allowed her to become known in the area for her quality service. \r\n\r\nRight now, she is asking for help with the loan to buy different tools and materials wholesale (hair treatments, dyes, shampoo, conditioner and more). This way, she will be able to generate direct employment and in addition offer a better service. Her customers will be more comfortable and this will help her improve her sales and her income.  \r\n\r\nWith her perseverance and projects for the future, Diana wants to grow her beauty salon. With it, she can generate more employment opportunities for employment for mothers who head their households. The result will be better well being not only for her family, but she will be contributing towards other people enjoying better living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200.23,"image":{"id":1883148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy different tools and materials wholesale (hair treatments, dyes, shampoo, conditioner, and more).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Rionegro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2015-05-25T14:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-24T14:20:04Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.49,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Paola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.16,"local_amount":151118,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:45:09Z","rounded_local_amount":151717.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.31,"payment_id":681375070},{"amount":57.54,"local_amount":157677,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":158302.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.68,"payment_id":711502437},{"amount":31.15,"local_amount":81919,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":82244.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.26,"payment_id":731020067},{"amount":30.89,"local_amount":86027,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":86368.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.24,"payment_id":752108224}],"funded_date":"2015-06-23T15:21:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":889770,"name":"Tuoi's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"T\u01b0\u01a1i is a woman of the the Kinh ethnicity who has been in the program of M7-MFI\u2019s forerunner since January 2002.

She didn't go to college as she wanted to work in her trade; she sews women's clothing to order.  She has a lot of customers, and the number of her customers is constantly growing.  \r\n\r\nMavjuda learned how to cut and sew clothing 3 years ago.  Currently, her parents are seeking to finish renovating their home to improve the family's living conditions, but they lack the money to buy building materials.  Mavjuda has decided to take out a loan and help her parents obtain the building materials needed to renovate their home.  She hopes that you'll help them acquire these materials and finish renovating their home.  Mavjuda will be grateful for your support.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":146.61,"image":{"id":1889349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"buy building materials to renovate her home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Vahdat","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-05-25T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-24T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mavjuda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":169.82},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":178.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":193.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":197.51},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":200.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":212.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":217.34},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":225.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":232.28},{"due_date":"2016-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":243.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":252.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.57},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.06},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.77},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.02},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.16},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.17,"local_amount":169.82,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":170.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681399999},{"amount":28.57,"local_amount":178.56,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:26:59Z","rounded_local_amount":179.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696610079},{"amount":28.37,"local_amount":177.3,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":178.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711526103},{"amount":30.9,"local_amount":193.12,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":193.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731041870},{"amount":31.6,"local_amount":197.51,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:07:35Z","rounded_local_amount":198.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752130828}],"funded_date":"2015-06-18T17:01:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":889795,"name":"Nicanie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nicanie is 32 years old and married with two children.

His work involves receiving and packing all the finished garments of the factory. Being a minimum wage earner and raising two children, Oscar's income is not enough to provide for his family, which caused him to borrow from money lenders with very high interest rates and who require them to surrender their ATMs as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nTherefore Oscar is asking for your financial assistance to avoid being exploited by loan sharks. He trusts that your good heart will provide him funds to repair and renovate his house to give his family a better shelter. He has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and he had no problem in repaying, since the loan payment is deducted every payday. He is thanking God and you in advance for your great help.\r\n\r\nOscar hopes to give his children a good life and send them to good schools to allow them better opportunities in life. He also wants to be the best receiver and packer to get a promotion and earn a higher income. He meets up with his co-fellowship** members to share stories of his work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services. \r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers conduct weekly fellowship meetings for the factory workers before their work routine to do Bible readings, prayer and discipleship sessions to encourage and inspire them to do their best in life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1887934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay for the renovation of his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-05-25T16:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-24T16:10:09Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":191.68,"local_amount":8333.32,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":8531.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314428},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":4166.66,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4265.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523125},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":4166.66,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4265.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433554},{"amount":95.82,"local_amount":4166.66,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4265.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954498},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":4166.7,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4266,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044468}],"funded_date":"2015-06-14T23:48:53Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":889865,"name":"Shahida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shahida is a 37-year-old woman living in Rawalpindi, Pakistan with her four children.

Dairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk that makes her very proud. \r\n\r\nAlthough she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have a humble time milking and also feeding. A good dairy unit provides a good place where animals can relax and also prevent them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Ruth believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production.

The climate is subtropical with a temperature that varies during the day from 21 to 35 degrees celsius.  \r\n\r\nVictoria is tan, has dark eyes, and long black hair that she keeps tied.  She is short and thin, and her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks at home and with her family, but she also speaks Spanish.

The eldest son is in school and the youngest is still too young for school. They live in a room made of brick and cement with a metal roof and a cement floor. They have electricity and running water.  \r\n\r\nGiven their desires to get ahead, they started a lending group made up of people with businesses such as: hairdressers, food sales, vegetable sales, sewing material sales, bookstores, butcher ships, making baby clothing, and convenience stores. This group allows them to apply for loans and improve their businesses.  \r\n\r\nVictoria's business is selling secondhand clothing such as: pants, turtlenecks, shirts, t-shirts, blouses, sweaters, jackets, etc.  She is in need of stocking her business with a greater variety of clothing so that she can compete in the marketplace.  She also hopes to open another clothing store in a different market. \"My business grows and the customers are consistent, I need to open another store,\" says Victoria. The upside to her business is that her sales are consistent, the downside is that she is lacking the money to open a second location.  Her dream is to open two locations in two markets. She hopes to incest in her used clothing business.  This is her second loan with the institution in the past two years of working in this business.

It has a warm sub-tropical climate with temperatures that vary between 21-35 degrees centigrade during the day. \r\n\r\nMaria has dark skin, dark eyes, long black hair she keeps tied back, is short, has a robust physique, her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks in this place and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for the business she does (she is standing in the center, wearing a light blue t-shirt). She shares her life with her children; the older one is in school and the younger one is not school-aged yet. They live in a room they own built of brick and cement with a roof of metal sheeting and a brick floor which has drinking water, electricity and sewer service. The need to cover her children's expenses brought her to form a bank of people with businesses such as food sales, vegetables sales, second-hand clothing sales, breakfast sales, costume jewelry sales, cosmetic sales, and calling service, to ask for a loan and improve their businesses. Her business is selling food and basic products such as water, bread, sugar, paper, noodles, rice, soft drinks, cookies, cleaning products, etc. in her neighborhood store. Due to the lack of business in the area, there isn't much competition. She does the work independently every day of the week during the day. \"The hot climate of the area makes the food spoil quickly, for this reason they should be kept refrigerated...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she can care for her children, the disadvantage is the distance from her providers to her store. Her dream is to open a wholesale business to do bulk sales. She wants to expand her business, purchasing a refrigerator to keep the food fresh since the warm climate they rot quickly. This is her second loan cycle with the institution in the 10 years she has done this work. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Maria asks for a loan to purchase a refrigerator to keep the food fresh, and with the earnings pay her children's school expenses.

Biba, aged 45, is the mother of three children aged between 17 and 24, of whom two are presently enrolled in school. Agriculture permits her to ensure self-sufficiency for her family and this has motivated her to be involved in this activity for six years now. She explains that agriculture represents \"the future\".  \r\n\r\nBiba cultivates peanuts and maize on her plot but as a farmer, she has to face difficulties such as a lack of rain, of agricultural supplies, and of high-quality fertilizer.  \r\n\r\nBiba is beginning her first year with myAgro and she registered because of the perspective of being able to increase her yield with the services proposed by myAgro and  due to the conviction of myAgro agents concerning the benefits brought by the myAgro method. This year Biba is making payments to buy a myAgro package of OPV (openly pollinated variety) seeds and fertilizer for growing peanuts so as to increase her yields on her plot of 0.0625 hectares. \r\n\r\nBiba has been cultivating peanuts for six years now for their value as a foodstuff, explaining the peanuts are directly edible by the family and are used as a basic sauce in cooking. They also have a commercial value since peanuts are a foodstuff she sells at the market. Biba is planning on the increase in her yield and her income to diversify her crops.

Her business is located in a sales stall outside her house, located in the southern area of the city, where the beaches of the Pira\u00ed River are located. There, are the huts that offer traditional food to eat such as majadito (dried meat), patasca (baked pig's head), and locro (a mix of meats with corn), among others. The flavorful \"horneaos\" are also sold, ideal to accompany coffee in the afternoon. It has a warm sub-tropical climate with a constant temperature of approximately 30 degrees centigrade during the whole year. \r\n\r\nYesica has dark skin, dark eyes, long black hair she keeps tied back, is of medium height, thin physique, her native language is Quechua which she speaks in her family and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for the work she does (she is third from the left, wearing a black top and short blue shorts). She has her life in her parents' house, who work in a business in the market. They live in a house they own, built of wood with a dirt floor which has drinking water, electricity and sewer service. Her desires to improve herself brought her to lead a bank of people with business such as tomato sales, sewing shop, second-hand clothing sales, woven products, fish sales, construction service, and making mattresses, to ask for a loan and improve their businesses. Her business is the sale of traditional drinks from the area such as mocochinchi (made with boiled dried peaches), chicha (prepared with a corn base), som\u00f3 (similar to chicha but includes boiled corn), and more. \"My business continues improving, the previous loan allowed me to start, now I need to improve...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that it has regular customers. The disadvantage is the lack of money to improve the business. Her dream is to have a large food stand where she can offer a variety of traditional food and drinks. She wants to invest in the purchase of tables and chairs to be able to serve more customers. This is her 3rd loan cycle with the institution in the 6 years she has been doing this work. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Yesica asks for a loan to purchase tables and chairs to be able to serve a larger number of customers and improve her sales.

Single and she support her family financially. She is one of the beneficiaries of the employment program of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative.*\r\n\r\nMaricel works as a Clothing Packer. She ensures that items of clothing are packed properly and are ready for distribution. The type of packaging used depends on the type, value, fabric, and destination of the garments. One of the main concerns of factory employees is how to meet the needs of their family. With the increasing cost of living their monthly salary is not enough to adequately provide for their families which forced Marian to borrow from money lenders who charged very high interest rates and surrender her ATM (their salary is credited to her ATM) as her loan collateral. These low income employees sadly have no access to bank loans.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Maricel is asking for your assistance to prevent her from submitting to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying them since the loan payment is deducted every pay day. She will appreciate much your positive response to her request to enable her pay for the construction materials needed to finish building her house. She is thanking God and you in advance for your good heart.\r\n\r\nMaricel meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work. CCT staff and volunteers conduct weekly fellowship meetings for the factory workers before their work routine to do Bible readings, prayer and discipleship sessions to encourage and inspire them to do their best in life and to be the kind of person God wants them to be.\r\n\r\n *The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1888111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay for construction materials to complete construction of her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-05-25T19:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-24T19:20:06Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maricel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1669.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665018001},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1669.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314435},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1669.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523132},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1669.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433561},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1669.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954502},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1669.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044472}],"funded_date":"2015-05-26T01:23:53Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":889964,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna is 48 years old and married with twelve children.

He is dedicated in full to his work. This man only thinks about going forward and delivering good produce. He knows that many people consume his farm products, and because of this, he makes sure his products are pure and of good quality. He is a 43-year-old farmer from Naitiri village, situated in the Rift valley province of Kenya. He lives with his wife and children on a small piece of land where he keeps cows and grows a wide variety of crops. \r\n\r\nFor 10 years, his primary sources of income have been milk,a side hustle business(motorcycle business) and produce. His biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals, to prevent these diseases. Nelson made a decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help him improve his farming activities. \r\n\r\nSometime this month, he applied for a loan to expand his farm. This will enable him to expand his operations to increase the overall output. The additional income from the expansion will go to his children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is increasingly becoming prohibitive to low-income communities, especially in the rural areas. As a result, kids are forced to drop out to start working to contribute their earnings to their families.

She carries great responsibilities. She has one child and she is the main source of income in her household. Her life has been difficult. Nancy has been farming for the past 15 years. Through these years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops, and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Nancy is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals for resale. Kenya's Nandi hills area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Josephine could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Nancy, but she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing.

That thought fills Vincent with enthusiasm and inspiration. Vincent is 30 years old and works tirelessly to raise animals. Through these humble tasks, he aspires to offer all of his children a university education. Vincent learned to do farm work at a young age, thanks to his parents. He has a tiny plot of land -- just under half an acre \u2013 to farm and has always struggled to support his family. \r\n\r\nFor over five years, his income source has been from selling milk, poultry, and vegetables. He supplements the meager income by doing other personal business. Vincent passionately loves dairy farming. Milking and feeding his own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. He is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in his village. Milk, poultry and vegetables are very perishable, and these products require timely delivery to the market. One problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. The Eldoret area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. \r\n\r\nThat is why Vincent is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Farmers like Vincent will use the motorbike to transport passengers and farm goods to and from the market. They are suited for areas with poor road networks which are inaccessible by cars. They are also very cheap to acquire and maintain. Invest in Vincent\u2019s future and you won't regret it. He is full of promise.

San Clemente is known for its beautiful beaches that are visited by many domestic and international tourists. There is a variety of beautiful places to see, and a diverse range of typical food dishes to taste.\r\n\r\nAnd it is here that 40-year-old Mirian lives. She is married and has four children, ages 20, 16, 10, and 8 years old. The eldest is studying at university, the second at high school and the two youngest at primary school. Mirian\u2019s husband is an electrical engineer.\r\n\r\nMirian is a housewife who, in order to earn her own income, makes a living selling Avon and Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and women\u2019s accessories). She recently also began to sell Ieudine products (beauty treatments, cosmetics and more). Mirian sells door-to-door and works almost every day. She also receives customers in her home where she has a few display cases for her products. Mirian sells on credit and collects payments every week.

Meet Abraham, a farmer in Nkubu. Abraham is involved in maize, poultry and dairy farming.

These commercial activities place him in a better position to engage in other agriculture-related businesses, which, in fact, he does. <br \/><br \/>Abraham is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to construct a cow shed. This will help significantly in managing the animals\u2019 health and hygiene. He has been in the farming business for at least 10 years. He has no plans to quit in the future as he finds farming to be both fulfilling and lucrative. However, his biggest challenges are the poor road network and lack of market. The cow shed, constructed through this loan, will later come in handy when Abraham scales up and introduces zero-grazing. The long-term impact is an increase in productivity and improved animal health.

She is married and is one of the beneficiaries of the employment program of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative.* She has been employed in a garment factory in Cavite for nine years already and works as an end line line quality control. Her function is mainly to advise the assembly line supervisor when the number of defects has reached a limit. She also inspects output goods and separates defected goods from acceptable goods.\r\n \r\nOne of the main concerns of factory employees in the Philippines is how to make ends meet. As a minimum wage earner and with the increasing cost of living, Dolores' income is not adequate to provide for their household needs. Sadly these low-income employees do not have access to banks and or other financial institutions, so Dolores resorts to borrowing from money lenders who charge very high interest rates and require her to surrender her ATM (her salary is credited to her ATM acct.) as loan collateral.\r\n\r\nDolores is kindly asking your financial assistance to prevent her from being enslaved to loan sharks. Your help will enable her to redeem her ATM and pay for the graduation fees of her child. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying them since the loan payment is deducted every payday. Aurora aims to give her best in her line of work and hopes for promotion and higher salary.\r\n\r\nShe meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work.  CCT staff and volunteers conduct weekly fellowship meetings for the factory workers before their work routine to do Bible readings, prayer and discipleship sessions to encourage and inspire them to do their best in life and be the kind of person God wants them to be. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1888180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay for her children's graduation fees and redeem her ATM.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-05-25T20:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-24T20:30:10Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:55:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1484.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665018004},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1484.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314438},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1484.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523135},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1484.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433564},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1484.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954505},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.3,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1484.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044475}],"funded_date":"2015-05-26T04:12:35Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":890035,"name":"Yunuke","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yunuke is 60 years old, married, and blessed with five children.

Anar is an IDP (Internally Displaced Persons) and lives in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. Because of money problems in his family, he couldn't get a higher education and has to work to earn money for family. They are living in hard conditions because of that. He is working every day without rest.\r\n\r\nAnar breeds sheep and has five years of experience in this field. He gets financial support from the government, but 200 AZN is too small an amount to cover the family\u2019s needs. Sheep breeding requires a lot of physical activity and spending most of the time in the open air. Pasturing takes 80% of Anar's time. He usually buys small sheep and calves, raises and fattens them for five to six months, and then resells them for a more profitable price in the livestock bazaar.
