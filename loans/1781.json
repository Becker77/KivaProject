At the age of 38, she has run her business successfully, however, she has been lacking funding to expand her business. With the help from Thrive Microfinance (in the form of training and loans), Theresa\u2019s business has grown. She has moved from sewing from her home to renting her own space in the city of Harare. With her group of three other women, called Big Fish, these ladies are applying for their second loan and so far they have a good payment history.

the far left, pointing his two thumbs up and wearing eyeglasses. The other farmers in the group are Gede, Komang, Ketut, Wayan, Udin, Ketut, Putu, Kadek, Haru and Ketut. Two of Sekar Pelangi members could not attend the photo-taking process. They are posing in front of a pig cage and all of them live in a small village in Sumbawa Besar District, Sumbawa Island, Indonesia. Ketut himself has a family with two children. \r\n\r\nKetut strives to improve his family economic conditions and has an intense desire to assist many poor farmers at his village. He runs a small scale rice farming operation and also has a small pig fattening business. He also works as a local government official in his village. However, he was troubled with the high price of non-renewable cooking gas and seeing pig dung wasted without further processing and polluting the water in his village. His farmland also was infertile because of too many chemical fertilizers.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing from Yayasan Rumah Energi and Paroso Mason Group (a local business, founded by Yayasan Rumah Energi, a biogas construction partner) about the Household Biogas (BIRU) program, Ketut saw that biogas is a good solution to his problem. He saw opportunity to reduce his dependence on non-renewable cooking gas. In addition, he also wants to use bio-slurry (biogas residue) for his plants to increase revenue and to reduce soil damage to his farmland. Thereafter, he invited ten of his friends to form a farmer group. Ketut feels enthusiastic about purchasing a bio-digester, but he does not have sufficient capital for it. A loan from Kiva will help him and other group members to make it possible.\r\n\r\nHe is optimistic that he can build a bio-digester. He can use the bio-gas for cooking and bio-slurry as fertilizer for his plantation. He hopes that, in the future, he can invite all the farmers in his village to use biogas and turn his village into an energy and food self-sufficient village.

She explains that peanuts are directly consumable by the family and are used as a sauce base in cooking. Peanuts also have commercial value, since they are a food she sells on the market.\r\n\r\nWith greater yields and higher income, Yama is planning on buying farm equipment, such as a plow, before the start of sowing.

At the beginning, she helped her husband sell fruits and vegetables on foot.  However, the fact that she had to be away from her home all the time led her to eventually start a business selling candy from her home.  Afterwards, she used the profits to buy a wider variety of products and now she has turned a modest business into a well-stocked grocery store that has been very successful in the community.  \r\n\r\nThis time, she will use her loan to buy rice, beans, sugar, oil, cheese, detergent, toilet paper, and seasonal fruit.  Irene is always seeking to provide a greater variety of products and to keep her store hours long, from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., 365 days a year.  She feels happy and notes that she is grateful for the support that she has received from her family, because her children are learning the value of honorable work since they have created their legacy through teamwork.

Bakary cultivates corn, sorghum and cotton on his plot but faces some difficulties as a farmer such as the lack of rain.  Bakary is in his first year with myAgro, and enrolled with the hopes of being able to improve his productivity through the services offered by myAgro.  This year Bakary is making his payments to buy a myAgro packet of open pollination seeds and fertilizer for the growing of corn in order to increase his productivity on his plot of 0.0625 hectare.  Bakary has been cultivating corn for 20 years now for its food value and also its commercial value, because corn is a food that he sells at the market.

Esta es la primera secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 5 a\u00f1os que se dedica a ambas actividades. \nEs por esos motivos que Andres solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para pagar los tr\u00e1mites de titulaci\u00f3n y defensa de tesis para obtener su t\u00edtulo profesional y ascender en su trabajo.\n","en":"Andres is a young man of 24 years, single, has no children, and is studying mechanical engineering. He is very intelligent, responsible, committed, disciplined, sincere and studious. \r\n\r\nHe studies at the public university located in the city center, near a big junction, which is why there is always a lot of traffic. The city's library is located next to it. From early in the morning until late at night, this place is packed with people. With its variety of options (cafes, restaurants, museums) it is not only the most comfortable place in the city, but also the safest. Everywhere are police officers, military patrols, and guards. There are always a lot of foreigners. The climate is cold and dry with a temperature that varies from 0\u00b0C to 12\u00b0C [32\u00b0F to 54\u00b0F] during the day.\r\n\r\nAndres skin and eyes are dark, he wears glasses and his black hair is fashionably short. He is short and lean. \r\n\r\nHis first language is Aymara, which he does not use anymore because he goes to university and lives in the city. He lives with his parents, who work as merchants. They live in their own house, built of bricks and cement, with a corrugated iron roof, and a wooden floor. They have electricity, drinking water, and a sewer system.\r\n\r\nHe is studying mechanical engineering in his fifth of five years. He enjoys learning about the construction of machines, likes to understand industrialization processes and he has a servicing nature.\r\n\r\nParallel to his studies, he works as a supervising mechanic in a cement factory. \"I work and the rest of the time I spent writing my final thesis\", he says. The good thing about his two activities is, that his schedules do not interfere with each other. But the disadvantage is, that he does not have the money to pay for his tuition and his thesis defense. His dream is to get his degree and advance at his work. He wishes to be able to pay for his thesis defense to get his degree.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with the organization in the five years he has been studying and working. This is why Andres is requesting a loan: to pay his tuition fees and for his thesis defense to get his degree and advance at work."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":392.3,"image":{"id":1884530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Mamine has been cultivating corn for 21 years now for its food value and also its commercial value, because corn is a food that she sells at the market.

In this Oaxacan community, a group was formed by 9 members who decided to identify themselves by the name of Desarrollo. \r\n\r\nThe members and their businesses are: Consuelo who runs a grocery store and Maria who has a cornmeal mill, while Adela works selling soft drinks and pigs; Edi, Marcos and Jos\u00e9, pigs; Esther, cosmetics; Ver\u00f3nica, medicines and Silvia, clothing.\r\n\r\nConsuelo is an enterprising woman who became a mother 28 years ago. Since then, she began with her business. \"Being a single mother is not easy at all. You have to work and take care of the little one. For this reason, I began by selling soft drinks. I will never forget these two bars that opened the doors,\" are the words of Chelo, as she is better known in the region. \r\n\r\nThis same job allowed her to open a small grocery store located in her home, so that the income and her two children's quality of life both increased. To be able to open the store, she outfitted a room in the house and invested only 5000 pesos in the purchase of basic items. Thanks to the earnings earned, her older child finished a program in engineering and the younger one is in his sixth semester of his degree program. \r\n \r\nAnother job that she can now do thanks to the earnings from the store is raising and selling small animals. So, Consuelo will invest the loan in the purchase of cheese, chicks, and feed for growth and fattening, maintaining both businesses actively. \"Thank you for allowing us to continue with the development of each of our businesses and for helping us to make our dreams a reality,\" she says with a smile on her face. \r\n\r\n*In the photo are the members of the group Chelo is wearing an orange top.

los visitantes. Sentarse junto a la gran presa para observar una formidable puesta de sol mientras se disfruta de una deliciosa mojarra reci\u00e9n pescada por los lugare\u00f1os es un verdadero placer. Adem\u00e1s esta regi\u00f3n conserva la cultura y tradici\u00f3n mazateca, como la elaboraci\u00f3n de trajes t\u00edpicos realizado por las mujeres de una peque\u00f1a isleta. \n   Es ah\u00ed donde se form\u00f3 el grupo Los Soles, nombre que fue acu\u00f1ado debido a que, al igual que el sol,  ellos quieren dar cobijo a sus familias y brillar en cada una de sus actividades. Los miembros son: Darien e Isabel quienes manejan una local de comida; Mario, una carpinter\u00eda; Cristina, una bisuter\u00eda. Por su parte Elvia vende material para construcci\u00f3n; Araceli, postres; Teresa, cosm\u00e9ticos y finalmente Luis quien se dedica a la alba\u00f1iler\u00eda. \n   Don Mario tiene diez a\u00f1os de radicar en esta comunidad junto con su esposa y dos hijos que aun dependen de \u00e9l. Tiene los mismos a\u00f1os de ser due\u00f1o en su propia carpinter\u00eda como \u00e9l mismo lo explica \u201cDesde que tengo uso de raz\u00f3n he sido carpintero, hace diez a\u00f1os se me present\u00f3 la oportunidad de iniciar mi negocio, ser mi propio jefe y no depender de nadie m\u00e1s\u201d. Sin embargo la experiencia adquirida le permite a Mario crear desde cosas sencillas hasta muebles muy complejos. \n    A\u00fan conserva con a\u00f1oranza las tres herramientas con las que inici\u00f3 en su actividad: una sierra, un cepillo y un torno. Con las ganancias obtenidas ha podido comprar martillos, clavos, lijas, barniz, laca, pinzas, brochas y, el elemento fundamental de todo carpintero, la madera.  Ahora los mismos clientes lo recomiendan pues adem\u00e1s de realizar un trabajo de calidad, los entrega en tiempo y cumplen con cada una de las expectativas. Este primer pr\u00e9stamo lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de madera.\n   Don Mario tambi\u00e9n ofrece empleo a dos j\u00f3venes de la comunidad quienes le ayudan en el negocio. Para \u00e9l m\u00e1s que una simple actividad econ\u00f3mica es el patrimonio de sus hijos a quienes ense\u00f1ar\u00e1 el oficio.\n\n*En la fotograf\u00eda se encuentran todos los integrantes de Los Soles, Don Mario es quien viste playera negra y bermuda a cuadros.\n","en":"There is a community in Oaxaca which is well-known for its hospitality to visitors. To sit beside a large dam and watch a beautiful sunset while enjoying a delicious locally-caught sea bream, is a real pleasure. The region also preserves its culture and Mazatec traditions such as the making of traditional clothing by the women of a small island.\r\n\r\nThis is where the group called Los Soles was formed. Its name represents the land and shelter the members want to provide for their families and the skills they wish to excel in in each of their jobs. The members are Darien and Isabel who run a small restaurant; Mario, a carpenter; Christine, a jeweler; Elvia who sells building supplies; Araceli who makes pastries; Teresa who sells cosmetics; and finally Luis who works in construction.\r\n\r\nMario, his wife and his two dependent children have lived in this community for ten years. He has been the owner of his carpenter's business for the same length of time and explains that ever since he could think, he has been a carpenter. Then, ten years ago, he got the chance to start his own business, be his own boss, and not depend on anyone. His experience to that point allowed him to make simple things as well as complicated pieces of furniture.\r\n\r\nMario still reminisces about the three tools with which he began his business: a saw, a plane, and a drill. With his earnings he was able to buy hammers, nails, sandpaper, varnish, lacquer, pliers, and paint brushes, and, of course, the most important for a carpenter, wood. Nowadays his customers recommend him because of the quality of his work, on-time delivery, and doing what he said he would do. This first loan Mario will use to buy wood.\r\n\r\nHe also employs two young men from the community who help him with his business. More than a straightforward job, Mario's work is to him his children's inheritance and he plans to to teach them his skills.\r\n\r\nAll the members of Los Soles can be seen in the photo. Mario is wearing a black t-shirt and plaid Bermuda shorts.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1876937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

She believes that with the financial support and the training in techniques of raising pig provided by the program, the pigs will grow healthily and help her gain good earnings to  gradually improve living conditions for her family. \r\n\r\nXien dreams that her children will enter good colleges and get good jobs and have a bright future. In the picture, she stands first on the right.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":601.25,"image":{"id":1888894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy food for the pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Vietnam","town":"Dien Bien","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":342,"posted_date":"2015-05-26T13:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-25T13:30:04Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Bich","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Khoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" La","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Oi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Xien","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":20000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4000000},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":9000000},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":7000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":416.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":323.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":185,"local_amount":4000000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-23T12:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4020975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696555946},{"amount":416.25,"local_amount":9000000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-02T13:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":9047193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752078128}],"funded_date":"2015-06-21T02:13:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":890616,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gladys is a married businesswoman who resides in Nairobi.

Her husband worked as a contractual laborer in construction but earned just enough for hand-to-mouth needs and she is now striving hard to earn a living without a stable job. The education of her three children and the day-to-day consumption was challenging, so she decided to open a store selling basic commodities.  \r\n\r\nShe is thankful that they joined Paglaum MPC. With very little capital, she was able to start her sari-sari (general store) business. The daily sales go the extra mile for the family's needs. She was also able to save the extra income.

She is the mother of 5 children of which only one still lives with her and together they cover the household expenses. Her business for the past 14 years has been selling pottery. She began selling itinerantly so she had to pack her merchandise carefully so as not to break the flowerpots, vases and decorations. <br \/><br \/>In spite of the fact that many people did not think her business would be successful, Guille demonstrated that with effort and dedication you can achieve your goals. \"I am proud of myself, as with the profits I managed to educate my children, grow my business, and continue as a sugar producer\". she commented with a smile on her face. <br \/><br \/>Four years ago she adapted a place and now sells in a regular way from her house although she hasn't stopped going out in the streets to offer her figurines. In order to offer a greater variety of products Guille invest part of her profits and the loans buying more merchandise. this time she will buy flowerpots and handbags. In the future she plans to open a stationary shop since there isn't one close to her location and she wants to take advantage of the situation.<br \/><br \/>\"Thank you for helping the growth of our businesses. If before they were active mines now they are super active as they yield more profits\" are the words from the group.

They live and work in the village of Mamissa, southeast of Bamako in Mali. \r\n\r\nSouleymane, age 60, is the father of ten children aged 10 to 32, none of them currently in school. His family's long-standing tradition in farming as the main source of revenue and food self-sufficiency for the household is why he started farming 40 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s poverty\u201d he explains.   \r\n\r\nSouleymane grows groundnuts and rice on his plot, but he faces challenges such as insufficient rain and a lack of farming equipment. This is his first year with myAgro; he signed up because of the potential to bolster his productivity through the services available. This year, Souleymane is buying one myAgro packet of OPV seeds and fertilizers to grow groundnuts and increase the yield of his 0.25-hectare holding. \r\n\r\nSouleymane started growing groundnuts 10 years ago for its value as a staple food because it is directly edible by the family, and it is used as a base sauce in cooking; it is also a profitable and marketable crop.  \r\n\r\nSouleymane hopes that an increase in productivity will leave him with a surplus to sell. He also wishes to be able to finance his children\u2019s weddings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1883157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy one packet of seeds and some fertilizers to grow groundnuts and bolster the yield of his plot.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Mamissa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-26T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-25T15:00:04Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Souleymane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Souleymane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dramane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yacouba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":605000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":605000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":605000,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":618275.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401680}],"funded_date":"2015-05-27T02:39:39Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":887265,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":262.45,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase corrugated metal, wood, nails and wire to replace the roof over the corridor in her home.

His challenges are low rainfall and the lack of farm supplies and quality fertilizers. \r\n\r\nKarim is starting his first year with myAgro.

Rizvanaben is a 36 year mother of 3 children. She is a homemaker as well as an entrepreneur. The household income is Rs 12,000 which is insufficient to meet household expenses and pay for the children's education. The monthly savings are just Rs 2500. With the ever increasing costs of household goods, she finds it very difficult to manage the expenses with a meager amount of Rs 12,000 every month. Hence Rizvanaben thought of starting her business to supplement the family income. She started selling vegetables which include tomato, potato, ginger, carrot, cauliflower etc. With this business she is currently earning Rs 5000. But she wants to earn more to support her children's education. Hence she came up with the idea to avail a loan to expand her business. \r\n\r\nShe got together with 4 other women who share similar interests. The other women are determined to help their families and want to expand their existing business. These families on an average earn Rs 10,000 a month out of which they are able to save only Rs 2000. Similar to Rizvanaben,Tabsuben is into selling vegetables which include tomato, potato, ginger, carrot, cauliflower etc. She will use the loan to expand her vegetable business and earn more income.

Tomasa decided she would buy and sell traditional textiles in various unique and beautiful designs. So, she sells tablecloths, bags, and caps, not only in her own community but also in nearby towns. She is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase more caps and bags in a variety of colors that are currently in high demand.\r\n\r\nFriendship Bridge has created non-formal, participatory education lessons on topics clients identified as most important, such as business, money management, self-esteem, women\u2019s rights, health, and children\u2019s education. At the monthly meeting of the Trust Bank, a Facilitator delivers these lessons in the native language of the women. The organization calls the effective combination of loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus.\u201d\r\n\r\nTomasa and her friends in the \u201cChutzorop Segundo\u201d Trust Bank are poised to step into a brighter future benefitting themselves, their families and their community. Kiva investors are valuable partners in this effort! Thank you!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1918.86,"image":{"id":1879687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

She has a husband and both family members get pensions for their persecution. Apart of this, Maia teaches English language to the local children and gets a small income from this, in order to help the  financial stability for her family.  As the existing income is not enough for the family, Maia decided to start an additional business. \r\n\r\nAll the financial institutions rejected her loan requests because of her unstable financial conditions.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Maia applied for the credit to MFO Credo. Her request was approved in the framework of Start Up program, which is joint initiative with Kiva, permitting  poor people to start or re-start businesses.\r\n \r\nWith the loan, Maia plans to go to Turkey, where the biggest market is located and purchase a stock of baby clothing.

Esta regi\u00f3n es conocida por su gran producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, los habitantes han trabajado por generaciones dentro de los cuatro ingenios azucareros. El campo, por lo tanto, es muy respetado por los lugare\u00f1os quienes lo consideran sagrado. \n   Los miembros del grupo son: Jessica quien se dedica a la venta de agua purificada; Mirna, comida; Ada, pollo y cosm\u00e9ticos; Teodora, cosm\u00e9ticos.\n   Do\u00f1a Ada es una mujer comprometida con su familia conformada por Don Diego, su esposo, y tres hijos; dos de los cuales dependen econ\u00f3micamente de ellos. Desde hace veinti\u00fan a\u00f1os  decidi\u00f3 involucrarse en el negocio familiar de venta de pollo. La actividad la realiza en conjunto con su marido; se levantan a las 5:00 am, colocan de 5 a 6 pollos en una reja, los pesan y etiquetan, posteriormente los acomodan en un veh\u00edculo para comenzar a ofrecerlos en la comunidad.

This region is known for its high production of sugar cane; its residents have worked for generations at its four sugar factories.  The land, as a result, is very respected by the locals, who consider it to be sacred. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are: Jessica, who sells purified water; Mirna, prepared food; Ada, chicken and cosmetics; Teodora, cosmetics.  \r\n\r\nAda is a woman who is dedicated to her family, which is made up of Diego, her husband, and three children, two of whom are financially dependent on them.  Twenty-one years ago she decided to join the family business selling chicken.  She does this work together with her husband; they get up a 5:00 am, put 5 to 6 chickens on a grate, weigh them and tag them, then they put them in a vehicle so they can start to put them on offer in the community.  On the weekends their children go with Diego to do the sorting, while Ada stays home to serve the customers who come to their house to buy more animals.    \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Ada's skills are even more varied; fifteen years ago she started a new business: \"I don't just sell chicken, in my free time I sell the best brands of cosmetics, which is why I say my cosmetics sell themselves; my best customers are the teachers,\" she tells us enthusiastically.  With her earnings from both of these businesses she has replaced the furniture in her home; she was able to buy a truck to sell chicken; and her children have been able to keep attending school without real difficulty.  \r\n\r\nThis time the loan she has requested is to buy cosmetics: nail polishes, lipsticks, eyeshadows, liners, foundations, creams, lotions, and deodorants.  \r\n\r\nAll the members of the Los Portales Group are infinitely thankful for the loans they have received, as they have been very helpful in terms of investing in their businesses.  \r\n\r\n*This photo was taken on Ada's back patio; she is wearing a blue top; the other three group members also appear in the photo.

Her community sees her as a trusted and cheerful mobile provider. <br \/><br \/>As the business grows, Yuni is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva.

Ellos son: Lidia quien vende cosm\u00e9ticos; \u00c1ngela y Blandina, abarrotes; Clara y Guadalupe, pescado y Mauricia, pollo. \n   Do\u00f1a Guadalupe, o Lupe como es mejor conocida, inici\u00f3 en el negocio de la pesca gracias a su esposo Don Jos\u00e9 con quien est\u00e1 casada desde hace veintiocho a\u00f1os.

The lagoon also represents a source of employment for many of the locals who, as a gesture of gratitude, walk around its perimeter every 11th of December accompanied by the Virgin of Guadalupe, patroness of the fishermen. Other important activities in the community are the planting of corn, beans, rubber tree, and sugar cane.\r\n\r\nWithin said community, the Las Gaviotas [the Seagulls] group was formed. They chose this name since they have a liking for these birds that fly across the sky over the lagoon. The members of the group are: Lidia, who sells cosmetics; Angela and Blandina, who sell groceries; Clara and Guadalupe, who sell fish; and Mauricia, who sells chicken. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Guadalupe, or Lupe as she is called, started the fishing business thanks to her husband, Don Jos\u00e9, with whom she has been married for the past 28 years. Now, their 3 children also participate in this activity, which is not only common in their family but in the entire region.\r\n\r\nThe activity begins when her husband goes into the lagoon on a boat in which he transports the necessary tools, then fishes throughout the afternoon and evening, and returns the next day. Afterwards, Do\u00f1a Lupe cleans the mojarra fish [a fish similar to tilapia] and goes out to sell it so as to have everything sold by noon at the latest. Recently, her son Abraham joined the family business. He is in charge of going around the hills on a motorcycle in which he has fitted a cooler where he stores 40 or 50 kilograms of mojarra. \"I like to sell mojarra.

Another important business is raising and selling livestock, especially sheep. <br \/><br \/>Refugia is an exemplary woman, who always has energy to work and to help her family. She has been married to Maximiliano for 46 years and has 7 children who are all now independent. She has one small grandchild she is taking care of. As there was no business that offered groceries close to their house, Refugia and her husband decided to open their own store which they have operated for 35 years now. \"Sales really are going well for us because all the people in our community buy from us\", she recalls with enthusiasm. <br \/><br \/>She is currently requesting a loan to buy more grocery products like milk, bread, eggs, soft drinks and canned goods amongst others and maintain her variety to elevate her sales. Unfortunately Maximiliano has lost his sight so Refugia has taken charge of taking care of the grocery store business and her nixtamal (corn) mill which she rents to people in the community. \"The treatment for my husband is very expensive and I also have to pay for my granddaughter's expenses so I have to work hard and get my grocery store ahead\". For Refugia her small businesses are a way to  achieve her goals. <br \/><br \/>The other members of the \"Los Lirios\" communal bank are Eleida who will invest in buying sheep and calves, Laura in chickens, Cecilia in frames, Mar\u00eda del Refugio in her store and sheep and Leticia in clothing.

waterborne illness. TerraClear is a social enterprise with the mission to increase access to safe drinking water, especially in remote households. Since 2010, TerraClear has been locally manufacturing ceramic water filters, which provide effective and long-term household access to clean water. \n \nTerraClear's success has been built on promoting an affordable and easy to use product with an innovative design. TerraClear became a Kiva Field partner at the beginning of the year to increase its outreach and provide these water filters to its end users. Ceramic Water Filters have helped over 40,000 families to access clean water in Laos.  \n \nCurrently, TerraClear is scaling up production and delivery to more remote areas. To achieve this, Kiva has partnered with Nexus Carbon for Development to provide a loan of $24,000 to TerraClear to purchase a second delivery truck to service remote households of Laos with safe drinking water. TerraClear recently purchased its first new truck \u2013 made possible by the generous support of the Kiva community \u2013 which is already helping to bring clean, safe drinking water to over 500 people across rural Laos every week.  \n \nThe second truck will allow TerraClear to transport 120-130 water filter sets per trip, which will reduce the number of trips from the provinces back to the distribution center. This will dramatically increase the number of filters reaching households every week.  \n \nAs TerraClear is scaling-up, this investment will require some time to produce returns. The loan has been structured with two repayment dates with the expectation that lenders could get paid back earlier if TerraClear produces results quicker than anticipated.  \n \nPictures displayed in the profile show TerraClear's staff and end users who have received water filters.\n \nFor more information about TerraClear and safe water in Laos, go to https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Nexus-c4d\/339349449574898?sk=info or www.laowater.org "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":24000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1887330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["SME"],"use":"to purchase a delivery truck to deliver water filters to remote areas of Laos.
