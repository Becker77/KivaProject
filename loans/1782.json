He lives with his partner, and has 3 children who are 17, 14, and 11 years old.  His business is the production of stucco.  \r\n\r\nHe is a good father, enterprising, patient, organized, consistent, responsible, and very hard-working.  His business is located in the community of \"Vichaya\", characterized by its extensive fields.  In the past, this area was a lush field made up of native plants called \"vichayos\" that fed the cattle that were raised there.  It is located west of the city, at an altitude of 4000 meters above sea level.  The climate is cold year-round, with a temperature that varies during the day between 7-16 degrees Celsius.  \r\n\r\nVenancio is of dark complexion, brown eyes, short black hair, short stature, and thin physique.  His mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1, which is spoken in the area and he speaks Spanish in the community and for business.  He lives with his partner who is engaged in the same work and with his children who are in school.  They live in their own house built out of adobe with a corrugated metal roof which has electricity, but does not have water or sewer.  His business is the production of stucco.  Fine-grained stucco is a mix of slaked lime, pulverized marble, plaster, natural pigments, etc, and it hardens when mixed with water.  It is used for covering walls and ceilings.  He states: \"I began my work looking for work in my community, I met my partner and together we work in the business.\"  The advantage of his business is that his customers demand the product; the disadvantage is the lack of water and fuel to work.  \r\n\r\nHis dream is to build a brick house.  He wants to invest in his business through the purchase of firewood and fuel for the production of stucco.  This is his first loan cycle with the institution in the 20 years that he has been doing this work independently.  It is for these reasons that Venancio requests a loan for the purchase of firewood and fuel to produce stucco and with the profits to build a brick house.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":806.68,"image":{"id":1884712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to purchase firewood and fuel to produce stucco and with the profits to build a brick house.

Now it\u2019s time for you to meet one of Ruma\u2019s agents, Handoko. Handoko lives in Lumajang, located approximately 150 km southeast of Surabaya, the capital city of East Java, Indonesia. He knew Ruma from Ruma\u2019s sales executive coming to his stall, and he decided to join Ruma because he wants to learn about how to expand his business in technology. \n\nRight now, Handoko is becoming a mobile airtime credits and bill payment services provider for his community. He feels happy because since he is becoming a Ruma's agent, he can give social impact to his community that needs access to such services. His community sees him as a trusted and friendly mobile provider.\n\nAs the business grows, he needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits to his community. Handoko\u2019s goal towards Ruma in the near future is to serve as an e-commerce business for his community with Ruma\u2019s latest product called Mapan. \n\nAs seen in the photo, Handoko is the one who is sitting in his own stall, together with his wife. He is thankful for your kind support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1872784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use

Based on his dedication and enthusiasm, today he has more than 15 aquariums that he also services. \n\nPeter is the first born in a family of three children and was inspired to venture into entrepreneurship by his grandfather, who is a successful entrepreneur. He served as the deputy CEO of his enterprise in high school, where he sharpened his leadership and entrepreneurship skills through the Junior Achievement program. In order to enhance his entrepreneurial skills, Peter gained more skills in aquarium maintenance and construction through apprenticeship.\n\nPeter managed to develop a website for his business from the previous loan he received from KIVA. This has increased his visibility and has increased his customer base. He is receiving more referrals.

He asks for a loan to be able to cover his educational expenses. This is his story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Jeffy Alexander. I am 18 years old. I was born in the Distrito Nacional and was raised in Santo Domingo Este. I am the son of parents who are visually impaired, my mother works as a receptionist and my father works as an employee in the public sector.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am a student at the University Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo (UASD), with a major in architecture. I am passionate about architecture and everything related to the design and construction of homes and places.  \r\n\r\nDespite my parents' condition, they have helped me a lot. But our situation merits us asking for a student loan because the degree I am studying for is very expensive and even with studying at a public university, the expenses are too much for a family with limited resources like mine. If I don't get this loan, it will be very difficult for me and for my parents because this will mean that I would have to stop studying to work and help my parents with the household expenses. In addition, my goal to be a great architect would be truncated and I would lose the opportunity to repay all that my parents have done for me. \r\n\r\nIf I get this loan, it would be a great help. I wouldn't have to worry or make my parents worry about my expenses for transportation, books, some materials I need for my studies, and I could continue studying for my degree. \r\n\r\nOne of my goals is to be able to have my own architecture company, which will work in construction and reconstruction of homes for people who have disabilities and limited resources. I feel I am an extremely blessed person because despite my parents being as they are, they struggle and get ahead so that I can be a great person in the future and they are my example. In my family goals, I want to get married and have a lovely family with four children. \r\n\r\nOnce I finish my university studies, I will look for work to get a little work experience and then I would like to go to South Korea to get my masters degree in design and reconstruction of houses and apartments. I have always liked design and reconstruction of homes and I think that this will be the work field where I hope to work. .

With the earnings she would buy more pieces of clothing until she eventually opened a small store in her home where she sells clothing, shoes, jewelry, perfume, and lingerie.

As a result of this, he never received any formal employment, and yet never surrender to that. He started farming and, through farming, he has been able to take care of his parents and siblings. \r\n\r\nLeonard's sources of income are vegetables, milk, and eggs. These products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. The Kapsowar area has bad terrain, a poor road network, and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. \r\n\r\nThis is why Leonard is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Using a motorbike, he will be able to deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. \r\n\r\nLeonard is very determined to succeed and, because he is very disciplined with finances, he expects that with his accumulated profits, he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and also for his parents. \r\n\r\nLeonard's dream is to go back to school, and he hopes that, through your loan, you will help him realize his dream."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":84.33,"image":{"id":1889381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike to deliver his farm products to market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-27T01:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-26T01:00:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.2,"local_amount":2862.44,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3129.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588488},{"amount":17.24,"local_amount":1532.54,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506780},{"amount":34.89,"local_amount":3101.57,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3390.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111750}],"funded_date":"2015-06-01T08:59:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nathan Tichenor","image":28733}},{"id":891824,"name":"Elisa","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"Nasceu em Namaacha prov\u00edncia de Maputo tem 46 anos de idade, solteira, m\u00e3e de 2 filhos menores de idade, todos frequentam a escola, n\u00e3o responsabiliza-se por ningu\u00e9m.\n\u00c9 avicultora a mais de 7 onde ganha um valor que aplica nas despesas da sua casa.

He is single, has no children and is studying toward a degree in Agro-Industry. \r\n<p>\r\nWilly is enterprising, tenacious, active, committed, responsible and a very good student.  He attends the \"Unidad Acad\u00e9mica Campesinas de \u2018Batallas\u2019\" in an area known for its proximity to the sacred lake, Titicaca.  The inhabitants there make their livings in agriculture, handicrafts, fishing and raising livestock.

The disadvantage is his lack of resources to purchase study materials.  \r\n<p>\r\nWilly's dream is to implement a business model to improve agriculture in the area.  He wants to be able to purchase school supplies, such as books, notebooks and pencils and to pay for his transportation and school-related costs.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is Willy's first lending cycle with the institution in the year he has been attending the university. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is why Willy is requesting a loan: to purchase school supplies so he can implement a business model to improve agriculture in his community.

He is a single man with no children, whose business is the production of artisanal cheeses. He is enterprising, intelligent, patient, persistent, responsible, and very hard working.\r\n\r\nHe operates his business in the community of Calasaya. This is an indigenous community that originated on a ranch on the south side of the sacred lake Titicaca, at 3985 meters over sea level.\r\n\r\nSamuel is brown-skinned, with hazel eyes, and short black hair. He is of short stature and has a slim build. His native tongue is Aymara, which is spoken in the region, and he speaks Spanish in the general culture and in his business interactions. He lives with his older parents, who do not work. They share a home that they own, built of adobe, with a tin roof and a brick floor. It has electricity and well water, which is obtained by an electric pump. \r\n\r\nHe is in the business of producing and selling artisanal cheese, which he makes from raw milk produced in his own barn. He forms it by hand, wrapping the curd in cotton and hanging it by four corners. As the whey comes out, he ties it and puts it in brine and then lets it age in cellars so that the surface flora emerge.  \u201cWe produce artisanal cheese and we\u2019re also beginning to produce pasteurized cheeses,\u201d he says. His business benefits from family experience but has the disadvantage of not having enough milk for production.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to expand his barn and increase his cheese production. He hopes to buy dairy cattle to increase his milk production and pasteurize his latest product.  This is the first loan cycle with the institution in the two years that he has been doing this on his own. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons Samuel is seeking this loan to buy dairy cattle for pasteurization of his new line of artisanal cheeses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":636.24,"image":{"id":1884471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese Making","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy dairy cattle for pasteurization of his new line of artisinal cheeses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-05-27T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-26T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":315.76},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":304.14},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":322.99},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":321.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":354.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":365.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":373.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":399.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":411.42},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":429.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":450.9},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":449.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.82},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.71},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.42},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.64},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":636.24,"local_amount":4241.6,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4389.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344562}],"funded_date":"2015-06-15T18:20:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"K Fisher"}},{"id":887378,"name":"Pascuala Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Pascuala, de 64 a\u00f1os, es una mujer trabajadora y entregada a su trabajo.

She has a 2-year old son and earns her living running a traditional clothing business.\r\n\r\nJimena is a good mother, enterprising, determined, patient, organized, responsible, and very hardworking. Her business is located in the Luis Pampa area, south of the town. The local houses are typical of the area, made of adobe with earth floors. The climate is cold and dry with a temperature which varies from -2 to 10C.\r\n\r\nJimena is dark-skinned with brown eyes and long black hair worn in a braid. She is small in size and slim. She dresses in traditional clothing (skirt, shawl and hat), and her native language is Aymar\u00e1 which she speaks with her family. She also speaks Spanish for cultural and business reasons. \r\n\r\nHer partner earns his living making clothing. Their son doesn't yet go to school. They live in their own house made of bricks and cement with a corrugated metal roof and a wooden floor. They have water, electricity, gas and a sewer system.\r\n\r\nJimena sells women's traditional clothing which consists of a hat, shawl, skirt, underskirt, shoes, and accessories. She explains that she started her business with help from her mother and then became independent. She has the advantage of being able to run her business from her home so doesn't have to pay rent. A disadvantage is that she doesn't have regular customers.\r\n\r\nJimena's dream is to open a store selling clothing. She now wishes to buy fabric wholesale for making traditional clothing. This is her first loan with this institution in the six years she's been running her business.\r\n\r\nJimena is seeking a loan to buy lengths of fabric to make traditional clothing and open a clothing store.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":457.24,"image":{"id":1884774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"buy lengths of fabric to make traditional clothing and open a clothing store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-05-27T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-26T06:50:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jimena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":545.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":469.85},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":490.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":519.81},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":520.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":576.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":583.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":603.98},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":642.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":654.7},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":698.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":694.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.82},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.38},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.44},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.12},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.87},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.22},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":148.62,"local_amount":1014.93,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344569},{"amount":71.97,"local_amount":491.47,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":496.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554778},{"amount":75.96,"local_amount":518.83,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":524.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468864},{"amount":79.25,"local_amount":541.25,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":546.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296697},{"amount":81.44,"local_amount":556.15,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":561.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076867}],"funded_date":"2015-06-22T04:07:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":891066,"name":"Jovie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jovie is 33 years old and married with five children, three of whom are currently in school.\r\n\r\nJovie is in the agricultural business, raising livestock in the Philippines.

Amos, from the Kitale area of Kenya, has never secured one and has opted to be a smallholder farmer. He decided that he will be independent and contribute to his community by practicing mixed farming. His primary sources of income are dairy and poultry farming, as well as some personal business that he does to supplement his meagre income. Deciding to practice poultry farming for Amos was not difficult. He learned the practice from his parents. For the past three years, Amos has been earning a decent income from poultry farming. However, the demand is overwhelming and he wants to increase his poultry, but the biggest challenge is lack of funds. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. Poultry farming has become one of the most important aspects of agriculture in Kenya because it creates business opportunities for entrepreneurs and it\u2019s a kind of business that seems unlikely to ever dry up. Poultry farming is a less strenuous activity that is profitable. Many poultry farmers find a sense of fulfillment having hens all over their homestead. The hens lay eggs that can be consumed or sold. If taken seriously, poultry farming has the potential of being a big business because the demand for poultry products is always high. \r\n\r\nAmos is blessed with two beautiful children whom he refers to as his \"heartbeat.\u201d With your loan, Amos is going to make more income, which will enable him to take care of his family's expenses.

Three of his children currently attend school. \r\n\r\nThe family tradition is anchored in agricultural practice, an activity which constitutes the main source of income and provides food self-sufficiency for the family. For this reason, Drissa decided to become a farmer 55 years ago. Drissa says that \"one can know one thing, but not everything.\"  He grows groundnut, maize and cotton on his plot of land. As a farmer, however, he faces challenges such as the lack of farming tools and of high-quality fertilizers and seeds.  He says that \"a seated man is more prudent than a walking man.\"\r\n\r\nDrissa is starting his first year with myAgro. He decided to join because of the payment system and the high-quality seeds and fertilizers.  This year, he will be making payments to purchase a myAgro package of OPV (open-pollinated variety) seeds and fertilizers to grow maize in order to increase his yield on his 0.25 hectare of land.\r\n\r\nDrissa has been growing maize for 15 years now for its nutritional and commercial value, since he sells maize at the market. With his expected increased yield and income, he is planning to diversify his cultures and to expand his activity to the retail business.

His love has been enough to show him that he needs to work hard to help his siblings and parents get ahead with excellent values and education. \r\n\r\nPhilip is a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who hails from Kitale, a rural town in Kenya. He really loves and cherishes his family. Philip and his siblings work as a team supporting each other, and have practiced mixed farming for the past 10 years. \r\n\r\nPhilip has an affinity for farming. Because of the liking that he has for farming, he has even nicknamed one of his cows, which makes him a very proud farmer, especially when he is milking his cows. Through his dairy cow, he is able to get between 5-10 liters of milk a day, and this helps him support his parents and siblings. \r\n\r\nPhilip practices crop farming, but he has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements; that is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, he will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that he will use to greatly improve his crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure him a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels.

However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past eight years. She is an early riser who goes to her farm to earn a living. \r\n\r\nJackline has space on her farm to use for dairy farming, so she respectfully requests a loan to buy a dairy cow. Chuka is an area that has a large population and there is a high demand for milk. Jackline, being an enterprising person, wants to take full advantage of that need and earn extra income. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan will allow her to change her standard of living and expand her milk-selling business. Jackline plans to open a very large milk-selling business in the nearby shopping center and to package milk. She wants to be economically empowered. \r\n\r\nShe knows that accessing funds is challenging, but with partners such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, she feels relieved to know that all her dreams will be achieved and she will be able to provide a secure future for her children and improve her family's living conditions.

Like many smallholder farmers in Kenya, he owns a tiny inherited plot of land to live off of, just under half an acre, and has always struggled to support his family. His primary sources of income have been milk, poultry, crops and some small personal business he engages in to supplement his meager income. James passionately loves dairy farming, but one challenge he has been facing is lack of water for home consumption and irrigating his farm. Most of the rainwater goes to waste and therefore James is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to buy a water tank and water pipes. With the water tank and water pipes, he will be able to harvest and store rainwater in the tank. This loan will be of much help because James will not be walking for long distances in search of this precious commodity. The tank will assist him in irrigating his farm, hence increasing productivity and income levels. All that James waits for is your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":66.46,"image":{"id":1889543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy water pipes and a water tank.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-27T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-26T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":987.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1016.31},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1046.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1076.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1108.04},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1140.43},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1173.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1208.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1243.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.7},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.26},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":12.11,"local_amount":968.78,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1178.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378779},{"amount":13.17,"local_amount":1053.66,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1282.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588493},{"amount":12.95,"local_amount":1035.77,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1260.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506786},{"amount":13.97,"local_amount":1117.42,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1359.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023601},{"amount":14.26,"local_amount":1141.13,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111756}],"funded_date":"2015-05-27T19:30:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":891154,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad is a 28-year-old single man from Qalqilya city.

Svetlana's loan has been approved within the joint initiative between SEF and Kiva, which provides loans to the under-served population of the Shirak region to help them to access the market and earn a living."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":220,"image":{"id":1889651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for potato seeds and fertilizer to enlarge the potato cultivation and gather more income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Akhuryan village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2015-05-27T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-26T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Svetlana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":54.57},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":57.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":55.85},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.13},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.72},{"due_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61.39},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.05},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.46},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.16},{"due_date":"2016-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":64.65},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.97},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.48},{"due_date":"2017-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":65.86},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.76},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.83},{"due_date":"2017-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":69.14},{"due_date":"2017-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70.15},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.97},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.85},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.13},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.8},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.72},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.39},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.05},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.46},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.16},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.65},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.97},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.48},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.86},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.76},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.83},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.14},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.15},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51,"local_amount":51,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-18T12:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681521516},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-29T12:10:41Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711658566},{"amount":58,"local_amount":58,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:22:46Z","rounded_local_amount":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731162930},{"amount":57,"local_amount":57,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:21:32Z","rounded_local_amount":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752250725}],"funded_date":"2015-06-23T16:49:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":891241,"name":"Safia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Safia is a 40-year-old mother of seven children.

Tamar finds it hard to tackle the financial difficulties and make a good living condition for her children. She is unemployed and doesn't have any source of income for herself. As there is a high unemployment rate in the region and she is unable to start any stable job, she decided to be involved in her own business.  She requested a loan for it's starting. According to above mentioned situation, Tamar lacks the access to capital markets and financial institutions to obtain credit for starting business, as they require stable income and business experience.  The Start Up program created by Kiva and Credo enabled her to get a loan of 1500 GEL and start her trading business.

Her loan request was approved within the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products since they have low incomes and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers.\u201d \r\n\r\nOlia will purchase a milk cow and will start production of yogurt.

Yiritio, aged 59, is the mother of two children aged 22 and 35, one of whom is presently in school. Family tradition being anchored in agriculture, principle source of revenue and of food self-sufficiency for the household, but also the fact that agriculture has allowed her to ensure self-sufficiency for her family has moved Yiritio to work in this field for 40 years now. \r\n\r\nYiritio cultivates peanuts on her plot but as a farmer she also has to face difficulties such as lack of rain and of high-quality fertilizer and seeds. Yiritio is beginning her first year with myAgro and she registered because of the perspective of increasing her yield through the services proposed by myAgro.  \r\n\r\nThis year Yiritio is making payments to purchase a myAgro package of OPV (openly pollinated variety) seeds and fertilizer to grow peanuts in order to expand the yield on her plot of 0.0625 hectare.  Yiritio has been growing peanuts for two years now for their value as a foodstuff, explaining the peanuts are directly edible by the family and are utilized as a basic sauce in cooking. They also have a commercial value, since peanuts are a foodstuff she sells at the market. \r\n\r\nWith the increase in her yield and her income, Yiritio plans to raise livestock and expand her farmed land. Finally, she also hopes to be able to ensure the food self-sufficiency of her family.

year-old woman.  She is married and has a beautiful 6 month-old daughter.  She is from a humble family that lives in the community of Chichicastenango.\r\n\r\nWith the desire to obtain income and support her husband with the household expenses, Ang\u00e9lica started a business making traditional clothing.  She has 4 years of experience with this business.\r\n\r\nThanks to the enthusiasm with which she does her work making traditional Guatemalan clothing, Angelica has a lot of customers.  This is why she is requesting a loan to buy more silk thread, German embroidery thread, and embroidery floss, so that she can continue to make beautiful blouses typical of her town that are full of figures and colors.\r\n\r\nAngelica's greatest dream is to have her own store where she could display her products better and increase her income.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":115.36,"image":{"id":1885621,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to buy embroidery thread","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Quiche","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2015-05-27T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-26T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ang\u00e9lica Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.96,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:18:43Z","rounded_local_amount":175.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681267957},{"amount":22.96,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:16:20Z","rounded_local_amount":175.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696477740},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":505.05,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":529.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731215483}],"funded_date":"2015-05-27T22:20:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}}]}
