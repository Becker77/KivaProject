She lives there with her family: her two sons, daughter-in-law, two grandchildren and husband. Ofik's husband went to a neighboring country as a migrant worker with the hope of helping his family financially. \r\n\r\nNow, the family's only source of income is agriculture. Ofik and her sons cultivate land and keep hens. They get harvest from haricot, potatoes, cucumbers, greens and watermelon, and they sell the final produce in local markets. Ofik has applied for this loan to purchase fertilizer, pesticides, and to cover cultivation costs and hiring workers for land cultivation work. Because the arable land is very big, it is very important for Ofik and her sons to get support and organize the cultivation work. \r\n\r\nAs this is Ofik's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The First-Chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history. Through this joint initiative, almost 500 borrowers like Ofik get a chance to have their first loans and develop their businesses. Ofik hopes for the lenders' support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":218,"image":{"id":1889703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Diara is beginning her first year with myAgro and she registered because of the system of payment and the high-quality seeds and fertilizer.\r\n\r\nThis year Diara is making payments to purchase a myAgro package of OPV (openly pollinated variety) seeds and fertilizer to grow peanuts in order to expand the yield on her plot of 0.0625 hectare. Diara has been growing peanuts for 40 years now for their value as a foodstuff, explaining the peanuts are directly edible by the family and are utilized as a basic sauce in cooking. They also have commercial value, since peanuts are a foodstuff she sells at the market.\r\n\r\nWith the increase of her yield and her income, Diara plans to expand her farmed land and buy farm supplies.

He is currently requesting a Kiva loan, the first loan he is requesting from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, which he will use to buy fabric, thread and lingerie accessories to improve his business, increasing productivity, sales and profits, which would make his Kiva loan a successful investment."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":158.29,"image":{"id":1885648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to buy fabric, thread, and lingerie accessories for his clothing business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Puerto Colombia\/departamento del Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-05-27T20:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-26T20:50:04Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.96,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":66886},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73308},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75324},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77396},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79524},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":81711},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83958},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":86267},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88639},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91077},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":93581},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":102329}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.89},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.73},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.68},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.66},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.71},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.77},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.14,"local_amount":66886,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":68677.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.29,"payment_id":681350583},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":73308,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":75271.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.4,"payment_id":696560842},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":75324,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":77341.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.89,"payment_id":711475570},{"amount":30.1,"local_amount":77396,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:25:32Z","rounded_local_amount":79468.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.79,"payment_id":730994434},{"amount":29.21,"local_amount":79524,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:23:01Z","rounded_local_amount":81653.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.59,"payment_id":752082400}],"funded_date":"2015-06-19T14:05:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amanda Fried","image":null}},{"id":891317,"name":"Margarit","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margarit is from Dzoravanq village where she lives with her husband, son, daughter-in-law and grandson.

and has two sons. She has a high school education and has been a farmer for 15 years, helping take care of her family by earning additional income. Thanks to Saltanat's hard work, she currently has four cows and 20 sheep, along with a 2.50 hectare plot of land where she grows beans. She earns 19,000 som (KGS) per month.

They are led by Rukhsanabibi who is standing in the center. She is a 38-year-old mother of one child. She manages the household expenses and medical expenses single handedly. The household income is INR 12,500, which is insufficient to meet household expenses and pay for her child's education. The monthly savings are just INR 3,000. Hence, Rukhsanabibi thought of starting her business to supplement the family income. She started selling fruits, which include apples, mangos, bananas, pears, oranges, etc. With this business, she is currently earning INR 3,000, but she wants to earn more to support her child's education. Hence, she came up with the idea to avail a loan to expand her business. She got together with four other women who share similar interests. \r\n\r\nThe other women are determined to help their families and want to expand their existing businesses. These families, on an average, earn INR 10,000 a month, out of which they are able to save only INR 2,000. Similar to Rukhsanabibi, Sajeda and Anjuben are also into selling fruits, which include apples, mangos, bananas, pears, oranges, etc. They will use the loan to expand their fruit selling businesses and earn more income. Yasamin has her own variety store where she sells bangles, earrings, ornaments etc. She will use the loan to expand her variety store. Apsanabibi is into tailoring and she stitches blouses, dresses and petticoats for women. She will use the loan to expand her tailoring business. Together the group seeks a loan of INR 72,000. Your loan will help these women earn better and give good education to their children. It will also pave a way for a good standard of living and happiness among these families.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":479.19,"image":{"id":1889729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to expand her fruit selling business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dahod","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":428,"posted_date":"2015-05-27T21:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-26T21:10:06Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sajeda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yasamin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rukhsanabibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anjuben","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Apsanabibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":72000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:22:26Z","rounded_local_amount":6085.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681398540},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:20:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6085.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696608706},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":6085.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711532460},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6085.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731047004},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":6085.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752135749}],"funded_date":"2015-05-31T17:55:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":888045,"name":"Luisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Luisa una persona muy trabajadora y responsable vive en una comunidad al sur de Honduras junto a  su esposo e hijos.

Myriam's project was  very well-accepted by heads of families, and today after 27 years is still in existence.  Myriam  has many plans for growth, since she aims to continually increase the quality of the educational service she offers, driven by her sense of mission.\r\n  \r\nThe organization  provides preschool and primary level teaching, and is open from Monday through Friday from 7AM till 1PM.

She is now applying for a Kiva loan, the first application she has made to the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo.  The loan will be used to purchase teaching materials and maintain the  chalkboards, with the aim of improving the school atmosphere, thus making a successful investment of this Kiva loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":199.55,"image":{"id":1885658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to buy teaching material and maintain chalkboards","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Puerto Colombia\/departamento del Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-05-27T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-26T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Myriam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1280000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":77391},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":92513},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":95288},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":98147},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":101091},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":104124},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":107248},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":110465},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":113779},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":117192},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120708},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":142054}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.47},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.89},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.36},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.87},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.91,"local_amount":77391,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":80340.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.34,"payment_id":681350584},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":92513,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":96038.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.34,"payment_id":696560843},{"amount":35.96,"local_amount":95288,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":98919.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.98,"payment_id":711475571},{"amount":38.59,"local_amount":98147,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:25:32Z","rounded_local_amount":101887.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.58,"payment_id":730994435},{"amount":37.54,"local_amount":101091,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":104943.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.9,"payment_id":752082401}],"funded_date":"2015-05-28T01:14:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Heatherly","image":1523379}},{"id":891327,"name":"Lela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lela, who is a 40-year-old widowed woman, lives in Kutaisi city.

When she got married, she and her spouse moved to the city of Barranquilla and, in order to supplement her income, her brother-in-law proposed they sell underwear and pajamas. Even then she also prepared food at home to sell. After finishing school, she took sewing and baking courses. She only sewed for her children, but she kept her food business going.

There are eight women in the group who range in age from 24 to 57 years. They hold fast to their cultural traditions, with one of them being their elaborate and beautiful outfits or \u201ctraje\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Trust Bank is 26-year-old Maria, who is married with four children. She has a traditional textile business and creates colorful blouses or \u201chuipiles\u201d as well as \u201cfajas\u201d or belts.

It is the cultural seat of the \u201cQuiche\u201d descendents of the Maya. Here, eight women have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cAmanecer Zona 1\u201d who works hard to meet the needs of their families, including education for their children.\r\n\r\nOne of the newer members in the Trust Bank is 32-year-old Virginia, who has been a preschool teacher. She has witnessed the positive changes that her friends in the Trust Bank have made and is excited to secure a loan. Virginia is motivated to help her husband meet the economic needs of the family and raise their standard of living. Currently, she owns a beauty salon and also sells new and used clothing. She runs the business out of her home. With her loan, Virginia plans to buy beauty products and increase her inventory of clothing. She shares that she is really pleased to be participating in the Trust Bank for the very first time, and polishing her business skills as a small-business woman. One of her long-range goals is to find a storefront and move the business out of her home.\r\n\r\nEach month, Virginia and her friends in the Trust Bank meet to transact business on their loans. Also in attendance is a Friendship Bridge Facilitator who shares useful information with the women about the world around them and within them. At a recent educational training, the ladies learned how to identify and realize their goals and dreams. At other meetings, they might learn about effective business practices, health, hygiene, and nutrition, and the use of medicinal plants. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of education and small loans \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d and it is very effective.\r\n\r\nKiva investors are much-appreciated partners with Friendship Bridge for these women. We look forward to providing a follow-up report in the near future!

She was born in Latacunga in Mulal\u00f3 parish. She lives in her own house together with her children and her husband. Fanny is a very enterprising and hard-working woman who since she was small worked hard to be a support for her parents. They sacrificed everything to give her her education. Unfortunately they did not have the economic resources and she only got her Primary schooling but this has not been an obstacle for her. <br \/><br \/>Fanny has been working raising small animals like chickens, pigs, guinea pigs and producing milk and farming for some years. She dedicates 6 to 8 hours every day to this work which she learned from her parents when she was quite young. Her parents have been an example of constant struggle for her.  <br \/><br \/>Today she is requesting a loan to buy a milk cow as the demand now is very good. this will help to increase her income and sustain her sales and not lose clients. The most difficult part of her work for Fanny is when she has to transport her products and does not have an appropriate vehicle to do it.

His tricycle carries up to four passengers. In the Philippines, especially in the provinces like Silang, a tricycle is a common means of transportation. Jeepneys and busses are limited. Very few people own a vehicle. The town people usually ride a tricycle from their homes to market, church, to their friend\u2019s homes and to other destinations within their community. They even transport from one town to the other. He earns a minimum of PHP 800 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help him continue his transport business, Emmanuel is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan to pay for his tricycle maintenance. It is important that his unit is always in good running condition to ensure efficient service and steady income. He is positive that this will boost his income as tricycle transportation is really a necessity in their place. \r\n\r\nEmmanuel wishes to have other types of business to improve his income. He prays for God's travelling mercies in all his trips and prosperity in all his endeavours. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Saly cultive l'arachide, le riz, le maraichage sur sa parcelle mais doit faire face en tant qu\u2019agricultrice \u00e0 des difficult\u00e9s telles que le manque de pluie, de mat\u00e9riels agricoles et d'engrais de qualit\u00e9. Saly entame sa premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e avec myAgro, et s'est inscrite en raison du syst\u00e8me de paiement, des semences et des engrais de qualit\u00e9. Cette ann\u00e9e Saly effectue des paiements pour acheter un paquet myAgro de semences OPV et d'engrais pour la culture d'arachide afin d\u2019augmenter ses rendements sur sa parcelle de 0.0625 hectare. Saly cultive l'arachide pour sa valeur vivri\u00e8re, expliquant que l\u2019arachide est directement consommable par la famille et est utilis\u00e9e comme sauce de base dans l\u2019alimentation et aussi pour sa valeur commerciale, car l\u2019arachide est un aliment qu\u2019elle vend sur le march\u00e9. Saly planifie avec l\u2019augmentation de ses rendements et de son revenu  de faire de l'\u00e9levage et d'\u00e9tendre sa surface cultiv\u00e9e . Enfin Saly esp\u00e8re aussi pouvoir couvrir les frais scolaires des enfants ainsi que construire une maison pour la famille","en":"Saly, the woman standing first from the left in the first row in the photo, is a member of a group of fifteen farmers signed up with myAgro. They live and work in the village of Sola, southeast of Bamako, in Mali. She is 52 years old and the mother of six children, aged 2 to 18, of whom one is currently in school.  \r\n\r\nSaly is rooted in the family tradition of farming, the main source of income and of food self-sufficiency at home. Thus, she has been encouraged to do this work. She cultivates peanuts, rice, and a market garden on her parcel of land. But, as a farmer, she must cope with difficulties, such as the lack of rain, farm equipment, and quality fertilizers.\r\n\r\nSaly is starting her first year with myAgro and signed up because of the payment system, the seeds, and the quality fertilizer. This year, she is making payments to purchase a myAgro packet of OPV seeds and some fertilizer for growing peanuts, so as to increase her yields on her 0.0625-hectare parcel of land. \r\n\r\nSaly has been growing peanuts for their value as a staple food. She explains that peanuts are directly consumable by the family and are used as a sauce base in cooking. Peanuts also have commercial value, since they are a food she sells on the market.\r\n\r\nWith greater yields and higher income, Saly is planning on raising livestock and expanding her arable land. Ultimately, she hopes also to cover her children\u2019s schooling costs, as well as to build a house for her family. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1883188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to acquire a packet of OPV seeds and some fertilizer for growing peanuts for increasing her plot\u2019s productivity","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-28T03:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-27T03:40:05Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safoura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadidja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adjara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Bakary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Bakary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":290500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":290500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":290500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":301948.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401689}],"funded_date":"2015-05-28T04:31:01Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":888126,"name":"Jose Henry","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9, es propietario de una tienda de productos de la canasta b\u00e1sica y pr\u00e1ctica la crianza de cerdos; es casado y tiene un hijo de 5 a\u00f1os de edad, atiendo a tiempo completo su negocio para tener una fuente de ingresos permanente, no tiene ayuda econ\u00f3mica del extranjero. \nInvertir\u00e1 en alimento para los cerdos y surtir\u00e1 la tienda con granos b\u00e1sicos, bebidas, detergentes, jab\u00f3n, boquitas, etc., para cubrir las necesidades de sus clientes, aumentar sus ventas y tener mejor liquidez. \nSus sue\u00f1os son tener un estilo de vida m\u00e1s confortable y darle a su hijo educaci\u00f3n para que pueda tener un mejor desarrollo en la sociedad.\n","en":"Jose owns a shop selling basic and practical needs for pig breeding.

Enfin Diara esp\u00e8re aussi pouvoir couvrir les frais scolaires des enfants ainsi qu'assurer l'autosuffisance alimentaire de la famille","en":"Diara, appearing in the second row in the photo and wearing a white scarf, is a member of a group of 28 farmers signed up with myAgro. They live and work in the village of Tonfa, southeast of Bamako, in Mali. She is 55 years old and the mother of five children, aged 20 to 32.  \r\n\r\nDiara is rooted in the family tradition of farming, the main source of income and of food self-sufficiency at home. Thus, she has been encouraged to do this work for 30 years now. She cultivates peanuts, corn, and rice on her parcel of land. But, as a farmer, she must cope with difficulties, such as the lack of rain, farm equipment, and arable land.\r\n\r\nDiara is starting her first year with myAgro and signed up because of the payment system, the seeds, and the quality fertilizer. This year, she is making payments to purchase a myAgro packet of OPV seeds and some fertilizer for growing peanuts, so as to increase her yields on her 0.0625-hectare parcel of land. \r\n\r\nDiara has been growing peanuts for 20 years for their value as a staple food. She explains that peanuts are directly consumable by the family and are used as a sauce base in cooking. Peanuts also have commercial value, since they are a food she sells on the market.\r\n\r\nWith greater yields and higher income, Diara is planning on raising livestock. Ultimately, she hopes also to cover her children\u2019s schooling costs, as well as to ensure her family\u2019s self-sufficiency in food. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1883191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to obtain a packet of OPV seeds and some fertilizer for growing peanuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Tonfa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-28T03:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-27T03:50:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maguine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saran","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariamba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maminin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moumouni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Moussa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Bandji","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Oumar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":423500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":423500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":423500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":431355.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401691}],"funded_date":"2015-05-28T04:31:23Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":891731,"name":"Nh\u00f3m 06 Ph\u1ed1 H\u1ea1nh Ph\u00fac, Nam Ng\u1ea1n Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs H\u1ed3ng  has a manufacturing business sewing clothes.

They even ride them from one town to the other. \r\n\r\nTo help in operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan which she will use for maintenance of her tricycle. She is positive that this will boost her income as tricycle transportation is a great need. She is thanking God, and you, in advance for the financial help that will surely cover their daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Evelyn hopes to buy another tricycle to improve her income. She prays that God will prosper their lives and that they will enjoy good health and a long life.

They live and work in the village of Tabacoro-Tian, southeast of Bamako, in Mali. She is 47 years old and the mother of four children, aged 2 to 27 years old, of whom none is currently in school.\r\n\r\nYadie has been encouraged to work in farming for 30 years, since it enables her to ensure her family\u2019s self-sufficiency in food. She grows peanuts, okra, and sesame on her parcel of land. But as a farmer, she must cope with difficulties, such as a lack of rain and farm equipment.\r\n\r\nYadie is starting her first year with myAgro and signed up because of the payment system and the quality seeds. This year, she is making payments to purchase a myAgro packet of OPV seeds and some fertilizer for growing peanuts, so as to increase yields on her 0.125-hectare parcel of land. \r\n\r\nFor 30 years, Yadie has been growing peanuts for their value as a staple food.

Cela fait maintenant 32 ans que Noumoutene cultive l'arachide pour sa valeur vivri\u00e8re, expliquant que l\u2019arachide est directement consommable par la famille et est utilis\u00e9e comme sauce de base dans l\u2019alimentation et aussi pour sa valeur commerciale, car l\u2019arachide est un aliment qu\u2019elle vend sur le march\u00e9. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que, \"esp\u00e9rons la richesse sa facilite, l'\u00e9panouissement.\" Noumoutene planifie avec l\u2019augmentation de ses rendements et de son revenu  de faire de l'\u00e9levage et de pouvoir faire du commerce. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 que, \"le chameau aimerait bien s\u2019\u00e9taler mais son dos ne lui permet pas.\" Enfin Noumoutene esp\u00e8re aussi pouvoir couvrir les frais scolaires des enfants ainsi que construire une maison pour la famille.","en":"Noumoutene, who is sitting on the right of the bench in the first rank of the photo, with the myAgro flag in hand, is a member of a group of 12 crop farmers enrolled in myAgro. They live and work in the village of Zambouroula, to the south-east of Bamako, in Mali.\r\n\r\n47-year-old Noumoutene is the mother of six children from 11 to 25 years of age, of whom four currently attend school. She explains that \"when something good happens, it leads to recovery\".\r\n\r\nFamily tradition is anchored in the practice of agriculture, the main source of income and food self-sufficiency for the household, which prompted Noumoutene to practice this activity for over 30 years, to ensure her family's self-sufficiency.\r\n\r\nShe mentions that \"understanding is the best weapon\". Noumoutene cultivates groundnuts and rice on her parcel of land, but as a farmer must face difficulties such as the lack of rain, agricultural equipment, and quality fertilizer.\r\n\r\nNoumoutene is entering her first year with myAgro, and applied because of the payment system and the quality of seeds and fertilizer. She says \"you should not celebrate the cricket's funeral while the straw is still burning\".\r\n\r\nThis year Noumoutene is making payments to buy a package of myAgro OPV (Open Pollinated Variety) seeds and fertilizer to cultivate groundnuts and increase the crop yield on her 0.125 hectare plot (0.31 acres).\r\n\r\nFor the past 20 years Noumoutene has been cultivating groundnuts for its food value, explaining that groundnuts are directly edible by the family and used as a sauce base in their diet, but also for its commercial value, since she sells groundnuts at the market. She explained that \"hoping for prosperity fosters development\".\r\n\r\nWith increasing crop yields and income, Noumoutene is planning to raise livestock and become a merchant. She mentioned that \"the camel can't sprawl because of its back\". Finally, she hopes to cover the children's school costs and build a family home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1883198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy a package of OPV seeds and fertilizer to cultivate groundnuts, and benefit from training in agricultural techniques offered by myAgro","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Zambouroula","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-28T05:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-27T05:00:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noumoutene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Warabadje","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Aly","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":350000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":625,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":359462.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401695}],"funded_date":"2015-05-28T15:00:10Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":891760,"name":"Don Precieux (1) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judith is a member of the community bank group Don Precieux (1) in Brazzaville, the Republic of Congo.

The rural landscape is pleasing and soothing to those who visit. It is here the El P\u00edpila Group formed to request a loan from Visi\u00f3nFund M\u00e9xico and invest in their activities. The members of the group are: Cecilia, who sells groceries; Amalia, who sells chicken; Minerva, who sells purified water; Janet, who sells shoes via catalog; Minerva C. and Mercedes, who both sell pork; and Andrea, who sells refreshments. With the clear objective of providing her family with a better quality of life and to earn her own income, Amalia started her business selling chicken. For Amalia, the most important thing are her children, ages 18 and 12, who help her with household chores. Thanks to her savings and the support of her husband, Rub\u00e9n, Amalia purchased 15 chickens, a scale, bags and buckets, and in this way she started her business. Since then she gets up every morning at 5 to light the fireplace, then she fills a bucket with water to wash the chicken and get the meat ready, then she starts to sell it.

This region is notable for its high temperatures, which during the day can reach 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F). The name of the group comes from the majesty of the little bird, which motivates the members to be persistent in search of their dreams. The members are: Susana, who sells cosmetics; Nadia, who sells cosmetics and containers; Vianey and Carol Ann, who both sell clothes; Alejandra, who sells cakes; Perla, who sells costume jewelry; Samantha has a salon; and Maria also has a salon as well as an internet cafe. Vianey is a respectable woman in her community who has sold clothing for the past eight years. She is motivated by her family, which consists of her husband, Abraham, and her two daughters who are in school. \"The kids keep growing and more money is needed to provide them a good quality of life,\" she says. After selling without a fixed location for three years, she was able to open a store in her home, so she no long needs to travel the streets when it gets really hot. She plans to use the loan to buy pants for men and women at wholesale and in this way she can offer her customers more accessible prices.

The financial activity is made up of self employment in livestock, agriculture, and commerce as well as stores, which are a source of employment for the residents.\r\n\r\nIn one of the neighborhoods close to an old hacienda a group has been formed called El \u00c1ngel. The members are Flor, who sells natural medicine, A\u00edda, ceramic items, Gilberto, seafood and meat, Victoria, chicken, Guadalupe, shoes, Luis, cell phone accessories, Silvia, pastries and Mar\u00eda, who has a cooking business.\r\n \r\nAida is a woman who has always worked to give her family the best. Twety years ago, she started selling ceramics. At first, she would buy the merchandise only in the capital of Mexico. But over time and due to her customers' demands, she now also buys in Guadalajara and Cuernavaca, cities located in other states in the country. \r\n\r\nA\u00edda has always had a passion for sales. \"I am a merchant, it's in my genes. My parents were merchants, and thanks to them, I am what I am,\" she remarks. She offers ease of payment to her customers who help her improve her sales and profits which she uses now for household expenses as well as for paying for the merchandise she buys on credit. \r\n\r\nA\u00edda sells as a street vendor but she also sells from her home. One day a week she sells at a small space she set up with metal sheeting for protection from the sun. On a couple of wires, she hangs some pieces and others she puts on a table. On weekends, she also sells by the side of the road. In order to show off her products, she uses some grills. \u201cI am of the street\" are the words she uses to refer to her preferred points of sale.\r\n\r\nThis time, she will use the loan to settle the debt for the merchandise she acquired last month to later reinvest in more ceramic pieces. The group is grateful for the loans, with which some of them have started an activity and others have fortified the ones they had.  \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in Flor's patio and Aida is wearing a red blouse. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3100,"image":{"id":1880897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to settle the debt for merchandise she bought on credit.

Ellas est\u00e1n comprometidas con el bienestar de sus familias y motivadas para ofrecer una mejor de calidad de vida a su familia. \n   En su comunidad, Florencia es conocida como Flor, est\u00e1 casada desde hace doce a\u00f1os con Luis quien trabaja en el campo y maneja un tractor, juntos han formado una familia con tres ni\u00f1os los cuales se encuentran estudiando la educaci\u00f3n primaria.\n   Hace doce a\u00f1os Luis decidi\u00f3 iniciar el cultivo de plantas de ornato, aunque no pudo concluir su educaci\u00f3n preparatoria aprendi\u00f3 muy a cultivar rosas, cuna de mois\u00e9s, alcatraces y enredaderas. Flor, por su parte, se enfoc\u00f3 al negocio tiempo despu\u00e9s para hacerlo crecer poco a poco.

De esta manera Flor tiene asegurada una entrega cada semana; los clientes llegan hasta su invernadero para comprar flores o los mismos brotes. \"Realmente me gusta mucho estar entre las plantas, no me puedo quejar porque es un muy buen negocio\" coment\u00f3 con alegr\u00eda. Su sue\u00f1o, es seguir trabajando y tener capital suficiente para instalar otro invernadero muy pronto.\n   Flor se muestra gradecida con VisionFund ya que anteriormente obtuvo otros pr\u00e9stamos de la instituci\u00f3n con los cuales logr\u00f3 comprar una camioneta para transportar y entregar algunos pedidos de flores.\n   Las dem\u00e1s integrantes de Nuevo Chalchiuapan son Rosa quien invertir\u00e1 en un invernadero de jitomates, Martina en plantas de ornato y Ma.

The inhabitants are very cheerful, friendly and most of all, very hardworking. Confidence in the VisionFund team led the members of the Chalchihuapan Group to request a loan to develop their businesses. They are committed to the wellbeing of their families and motivated to offer them a better quality of life.\r\n\r\n\tIn her community, Florencia is known as Flor. She has been married for twelve years to Luis, who works in the fields and drives a tractor. Together they started a family with three children who are studying in elementary school. Two years ago, Luis decided to start cultivating decorative plants. Although he was unable to finish his preparatory studies, he learned much about the cultivation of roses, cuna de mois\u00e9s, calla lilies and morning glories. For her part, Flor began to focus on the business some time later, in order to grow it little by little. They initiated the entire infrastructure of the business with their savings and are now requesting a loan to buy more flower pots, because their plants are ready to go to market.\r\n\r\n\tAt the moment, Flor does not need to buy more plants as she sows her own shoots. During this two-month process, she is in charge of tending to them to later sell them. This way, Flor can be sure of a delivery every week. Customers come to her greenhouse to buy flowers or their sprouts. \u201cIn fact, I really like being among the plants, I can\u2019t complain because it is a very good business,\u201d she comments cheerfully. Her dream is to continue working and to have enough capital to install another greenhouse very soon.\r\n\r\n\tFlor expresses her gratitude to VisionFund, as she has previously received other loans from this institution, with which she was able to buy a small truck to transport and deliver flower orders.\r\n\r\n\tThe other members of Nuevo Chalchihuapan are Rosa, who is going to invest in a tomato greenhouse, Martina, also in decorative plants, and Ma Virginia, investing in embroidery.\r\n\r\n*The photo was taken at Flor\u2019s greenhouse.

This young woman, 19 years old, sells bags, sandals and personal care products sold in specialized catalogs. Her contacts are her principal customers who, in the vast majority, are young university students. When she gets a significant number of orders, she makes the order and delivers them to her customers offering them payment terms. This way of generating resources allows her to have a lot of time available so as not to neglect her education. To the contrary, she stays online all day and when she can't serve her customers, they leave messages that she responds to when she can. Currently, she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to invest in her customers' orders: bags with children's designs, sandals, creams, perfumes, and more. With the investment, Laura believes it will allow her to increase her sales and, with that, increase her working capital.

She offers delicious steaks, pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers and all kinds of fast foods. She makes her purchases from the deli and meat product distributors and buys her chicken and meat in small shops. <br \/><br \/>Currently she is applying for a loan from Kiva her first loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo  to invest in buying supplies and raw materials (chicken, meat, sauces, cold cuts and others).

She has a secondary education and raises livestock with her spouse in order to earn income for her family. They started this business in 2012 with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulsanam's hard work, she currently has two cows and four sheep. She plants corn and wheat to sell on a 1.23 hectare plot of land.

Meet Judith, 22 years of age and a very hardworking and self-driven farmer who is based in Kipkaner a remote village in Kapsowar. This region has harsh weather patterns, and poultry farming is the only profitable business venture that thrives. <br \/><br \/>Judith is happily married and blessed with a beautiful family. For the past three years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary sources of income have been selling milk and crop farming. She passionately loves poultry farming though. When asked what is most enjoyable about farming, her reply was \u201cselling eggs\u201d. Her biggest challenge is the lack of funds to increase her poultry farming. <br \/><br \/>She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Poultry farming is the only business that thrives in the Kapsowar area because of the harsh weather patterns, so she wants to take full advantage of the poultry business. <br \/><br \/>Judith is a member of Tuturung Self-help Group and through the group, she has received training on financial management and saving. Through the loan, she will sell eggs to the local market and to her neighbors, hence improving her living conditions and getting out of the poverty situation she is in currently.

She is married, and her children and grown up and independent. She has a secondary specialist medical education. She is hard-working, honest, and caring by her nature. Zhanylcha has been rearing animals and growing crops to get income for her family for the last 15 years. Thanks to her hard work, Zhanylcha has a 2.28 hectare plot of land on which she grows organic potatoes and beans for sale. She also does needlework, sewing national products to order. All this activity brings her about 9,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to further develop her business, Zhanylcha has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy potato seeds. She plans to invest the proceeds of the loan in further increasing her business and wants to save up to build a barn."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":399.85,"image":{"id":1891097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds in order to grow organic potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kopuro-Bazar village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-05-28T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-27T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.3,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zhanylcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3540},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3643},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3749},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3859},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3971},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4087},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4206},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4329},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4455},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4585},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4719},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4857}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.95},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.61},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.76},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.24},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.58},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":191.31,"local_amount":10932,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":11187.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291655},{"amount":131.29,"local_amount":7830,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8013.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.73,"payment_id":711411849},{"amount":63.95,"local_amount":4087,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4182.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.57,"payment_id":752026139}],"funded_date":"2015-06-17T12:36:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":888754,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl es un joven de 35 a\u00f1os de edad es casado, necesita una cirug\u00eda refractiva ya que desde los nueve a\u00f1os fue diagnosticado con miop\u00eda y astigmatismo en ambos ojos, tras una valoraci\u00f3n oftalmol\u00f3gica el especialista le comenta que es candidato al procedimiento quir\u00fargico, para el es muy importante poder dejar sus lentes de manera definitiva.

","en":"Namoyon is a calm and intelligent woman. She is 49 years old. She has two children: a son and a daughter. Her son is 20 years old, and her daughter is 17. Her children are grown up and clever.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy for a person to go on living after losing a loved one. Namoyon began earning a living following the death of her husband. Previously her husband earned money and provided for the family. Now Namoyon herself strives to feed her children. She sells clothing at the market. Namoton has already gained experience, and is moving her business forwards. She has been doing this work for eight years.\r\n\r\nNamoyon has decided to expand her business. She is asking for a loan to bring in children's and women's summer clothing.

They use well water from a pump, have electricity and do not have a sewage system.  \r\n\r\nThe need to help her children study brought her to form a group of people with businesses such as: second hand clothing sales, food sales, sheet sales, bread sales, cheese sales, egg sales, motor taxi service and plumbing service to apply for a loan and improve their lives.  Her business is the sale of brand name cosmetic products.  Her routine consists of visiting offices and businesses and offering beauty products of excellent quality as well as fashion accessories.  \"Direct sales is one of the environments with the most activity where every salesperson makes important decisions based on their own strategies\", she says.  The advantage of her business is that she counts on continuous clients.
