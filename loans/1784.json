the mother of four school-age children. Today, for her family's main income Batma rears animals and grows crops, having started 20 years ago with the purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, today Batma has a horse, six cows, and ten sheep. She grows rice, clover, and alfalfa on three hectares of land.

She says that she joined Pro Mujer six years ago at the invitation of a friend, who is also a client of the institution.  Currently, se\u00f1ora Alicia has a business selling meat.  She tells us that she started the business a number of years ago with a small amount of capital that she had saved.  She learned the business on her own initiative. \r\n\r\nThe loan that se\u00f1ora Alicia is taking out is to increase her capital (to purchase wholesale meat).  She will acquire the meat from merchants in El Alto and later sell it from her sales stall.  This form of work allows se\u00f1ora Alicia to generate an income to help her family financially.  She is married and has one son.   \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, se\u00f1ora Alicia's response is that she likes the area of health and the trainings that the institution provides. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2780.07,"image":{"id":1887539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase wholesale meat.

negocio es la venta de art\u00edculos y alimentos de primera necesidad en su tienda de barrio.\n\u00c9l es buen padre, emprendedor, dedicado, constante, paciente, responsable y muy trabajador. Su negocio lo desarrolla en la zona \u2018Pio XII\u2019 caracterizada por ser un asentamiento de chaskis (en el tiempo del imperio inca), donde se encontraron tumbas incaicas, cer\u00e1mica y piezas de oro de esa \u00e9poca. De clima frio y seco con una temperatura que var\u00eda durante el d\u00eda entre -1, 16 grados cent\u00edgrados.\nAntonio es de tez morena, ojos pardos, cabello negro corto, baja estatura, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica delgada, su lengua materna es el Aymar\u00e1 que habla en familia y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultural general y por el comercio que realiza( de pie a la derecha, viste chamarra negra). Su vida la comparte con su esposa que se dedica al mismo negocio y con su hijo que estudia en la escuela. Viven en una casa propia construida de ladrillo y cemento con techo de calamina y piso de madera, que cuenta con energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica, no tiene agua ni alcantarillado. Su negocio es la venta de alimentos y art\u00edculos de primera necesidad como; pan, agua, az\u00facar, aceite, fideo, harina,  arroz, manteca, refrescos, papel, galletas, productos de limpieza, etc., en su tienda de barrio. Debido a la falta de comercio en el \u00e1rea no cuenta con competencia. Actividad que realiza de forma independiente todos los d\u00edas de la semana en horario del d\u00eda, \u201chered\u00e9 el negocio de mi mam\u00e1 y tengo la ventaja de compartir con mi familia y estar al lado de mi hijo\u2026\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que puede cuidar a su familia y a su hijo, la desventaja es que el espacio de trabajo es peque\u00f1o. Su sue\u00f1o es abrir un mini supermercado para realizar ventas por mayor, el desea ampliar su negocio realizando la compra por mayor de abarrotes y material escolar para la venta en su tienda, ya que debido a que no cuenta con competencia el negocio se desabastece r\u00e1pido. Esta es la 6 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 20 a\u00f1os que se dedica a esta actividad. \nEs por esos motivos que Antonio solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de abarrotes y material escolar para surtir su tienda y con los beneficios pagar los gastos escolares de su hijo.\n","en":"Antonio is 41 years old, married and has a 12 years old son. He has a business selling articles and basic foods items in his neighborhood store.\r\n\r\nHe is a good father, enterprising, dedicated, persevering, patient, responsible and hard working. He carries out his business in the \u201cPio XII\u201d area, known for being a settlement of the Chaskis (in the times of the Inca Empire). In this place, Inca tombs, ceramics, and pieces of gold from that era were found. The climate is cold and dry with a temperature that varies throughout the day between -1, 16 \u00b0C \r\n\r\nAntonio has a dark complexion, brown eyes, black short hair, short stature and is slender. His native language is Aymar\u00e1, which he uses with his family and he also speaks Spanish because of the general culture and because of the type of work he does (he is standing on the right side wearing a black jacket). He lives with his wife who works in the same business and with his son who attends school. They live in their own home build with bricks and cement, a roof of corrugated metal sheets and wood floor. They have electricity but do not have water or sewage.\r\n\r\nHe sells groceries and basic items such as: bread, water, sugar, oil, noodles, flour, rice, lard, beverages, paper, crackers, cleaning products, etc. in his neighborhood store. Because of the lack of businesses in the area he does not have competitors. He works independently every day of the week during the day hours.  \u201cI inherited the business from my mother and I have the advantage of sharing it with my family and to be close to my son\u201d he comments. The advantage of his business is that he can take care of his family and his son. The disadvantage is that the space he has to work in is very small. His dream is to open a mini supermarket to sell wholesale. He wants to expand his business by purchasing groceries in bulk and to buy school supplies to sell in his store. Because he does not have competitors he runs out of stock quickly. This is the 6th loan cycle with the institution in the 20 years that he has been in business.\r\n\r\nFor this reason Antonio is requesting the loan, to purchase groceries and school supplies to stock his store and with the profits, pay for his son\u2019s school expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4100,"image":{"id":1887536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The climate is cold and dry with a temperature that varies during the day between -4 and 8 degrees centigrade.  \r\n\r\nElena has dark skin, dark eyes, long black braided hair, is of medium stature and her dress is traditional ( sweater, skirt and hat)  Her native language is Aymara, which she speaks at home.  She also speaks Spanish in public and for her business.  She lives with her husband who works in fruit transportation, and with her children who attend school in the morning and help with work in the afternoons.  They live in their own house, constructed of adobe with a corrugated tin roof and wood floor.  They have drinking water and electricity but do not have a sewage system.  \r\n\r\nHer business is the sale of fruit.  She started this when her husband was transporting the fruit from the north of the city to Tambo.  Now she is able to purchase wholesale from the producers and sell to smaller markets.  \"Fruit is sold all year, and now we are in the citrus season..\" she said.  The advantage of her business is that she is located in a very commercial area with easy access.  The disadvantages are the public transportation strikes, which make it difficult to move the fruit.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to buy a truck so her husband could transport the fruit.  She hopes to purchase the seasonal fruit wholesale such as:  oranges, mandarins, grapefruit etc. in order to pay the expenses of her children's education.  This is the third sequence of loans with the institution in ten years that develops this activity.  For these reasons Elena seeks a loan for the purchase of seasonal fruit wholesale and to pay the educational costs of her children.

She is generous, friendly, selfless, a good woman, responsible and very hard-working.  \r\n<p>\r\nLourdes runs her business in the \"Plan 3000\" area, which is one of the city's most populated sectors.  People native to the city and well as immigrants from other cities settle down there.  The area is located outside of the city and lacks many basic services.  The climate there is warm and subtropical with a temperature that ranges during the day between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade. \r\n<p>\r\nLourdes has a dark complexion, brown eyes and long black hair that she wears tied back.  She is short and thin.  Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family.  She speaks Spanish when out and about and to run her business.  (In the above photo, she is first from the left and wearing a white t-shirt and red pants).  \r\n<p>\r\nLourdes shares her life with her husband, who works as a taxi driver, and their children.  The two older children go to school, and the youngest is not yet school-aged.  They live in their own home, which is made of brick and cement, has a corrugated iron roof and has brick floors.  The house has potable water, electricity and a sewage system.  \r\n<p>\r\nA desire to improve her business brought Lourdes to lead a communal bank.  The members' various businesses include: selling cell phone covers, selling coca leaves, selling quinoa juice, perfume sales, making cloth, selling beverages, skirt sales, selling ice cream and making empanadas.  They are requesting a loan together to expand their businesses.  \r\n<p>\r\nLourdes's business is preparing and selling broaster chicken (fried chicken).  It is a way of cooking chicken that is home-cooked and delicious.  To make it, you need a lot of cooking oil.  \"The recipe is simple.  Fry it in hot oil until golden and very crispy.  You can always have it with french fries, rice or salad...\" Lourdes says.  The advantage her business has is that she has a regular customers.  The disadvantage is the competition.  Lourdes's dream is to open a restaurant that serves fried chicken.  \r\n<p>\r\nLourdes wants to purchase kitchen supplies, such as cooking oil, chicken, rice and other items she needs to stock up her business.

She usually sells foods such as biscuits, nuts and other similar products. Customers are attracted to buy from her due to the low prices and the many options they are offered. Rebecca's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. \r\n\r\nRebecca is requesting a 9,000 PHP loan to add capital for purchasing more products and merchandise to sell. She will use her loan to improve her sales and her additional revenue to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Rebecca hopes to prosper through her business, for she desires to help her husband in his ministry.

Su negocio es la artesan\u00eda en cuero; ella ofrece su visi\u00f3n y creatividad mediante el dise\u00f1o y confecci\u00f3n de diversos productos artesanales, como; bolsos, billeteras, monederos, tarjeteros, ri\u00f1oneras, pendientes, pulseras y otros.

Su sue\u00f1o es abrir una tienda para la venta de prendas de cuero, ella desea realizar la compra de materiales de confecci\u00f3n como cuero y otros, para la producci\u00f3n y venta por mayor. Esta es la 2 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 25 a\u00f1os que desarrolla esta actividad. \nEs por esos motivos que Carmen solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de cuero por mayor para la confecci\u00f3n de art\u00edculos de cuero para abrir una tienda.\n","en":"Carmen is a 58-year-old woman, single, with nine independent adult children.  Her business is in artisan leather crafts.\r\n\r\nShe is enterprising, independent, patient, organized, responsible, and very hard working.  She carries out her business in the \u201cPlan 3000\u201d Zone, which is characterized by colonization by migrants; native Ayoreo tribes and miners who relocated from the west took ownership of the place and started up manufacturing and commerce in all areas.  It has a warm, tropical, very humid climate, with a temperature that varies during the day between 21\u00b0 and 35\u00b0 centigrade.\r\n\r\nCarmen has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair that she wears tied back, short stature, and a strong build.  Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture, and due to the business she performs.  (She is shown seated, wearing a white t-shirt.)  \r\n\r\nShe lives her life in the company of her youngest son, who is independent and working.  They live in their own house, built of brick and cement, with a roof of corrugated iron and a brick floor, and which has electric energy, well water extracted by pump, and a sewage system.  Her desires to succeed led her to form a bank of people with businesses such as food sales, secondhand clothing sales, a tire shop, oil change, a bakery, a butcher\u2019s shop, and toy sales, so that they could request a loan and improve their businesses.\r\n\r\nHer business is leather artisan crafts.  She offers her vision and creativity through the design and production of diverse artisan products, such as purses, wallets, coin purses, credit card holders, belt pouches, earrings, bracelets, and more.  She carries out this activity with her own hands and some work tools in order to transform the leather, giving it identity, form, shape, and color.  \u201cAll leather works are created by hand, and therefore they are unique and original.  There are no two alike.  My work comes from a personal vocation for the creation of ornamental items, founding myself on the respect for a hand craft with a long tradition,\u201d she comments.  \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she has constant customers.  The disadvantage is the lack of capital to purchase raw material at wholesale.  Her dream is to open a store to sell leather items.  She wants to purchase production materials such as leather and other things, for production and wholesale sales.  This is her second loan cycle with the lending institution in the 25 years that she has been carrying out this business.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Carmen is requesting a loan to buy leather at wholesale for the production of leather items, in order to open a store.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3377.11,"image":{"id":1887661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

She is a member of a group of 13 farmers registered with myAgro, who live and work in the village of Konoko, located south-east of Bamako, Mali.  Fatoumata is 45 years old and the mother of three children whose ages range between 17 and 20. Two of her children currently attend school. \r\n\r\nThe family tradition is anchored in agricultural practice, an activity which constitutes the main source of income and provides food self-sufficiency for the family. For this reason, Fatoumata decided to become a farmer 30 years ago. She says that \"one cannot distinguish bad seeds from all seeds.\" She grows groundnut and rice on her plot of land. As a farmer, however, she faces challenges such as the lack of rain, of farming tools and of high-quality fertilizers.  She also says that \"an old's man words are sacred\". \r\n\r\nFatoumata is starting her first year with myAgro. She decided to join because of the payment system, the high-quality seeds and the technical farming training. She says that \"as long as you keep playing the drums, even the one who doesn't want to dance will start dancing.\"  This year, she will be making payments to purchase a myAgro package of OPV (open-pollinated variety) seeds and fertilizers to grow groundnut in order to increase her yield on her 0.0625 hectare plot of land.\r\n\r\nFatoumata has been growing groundnut for 20 years now for its nutritional value, since groundnut can be readily consumed by the family and is used as an ingredient in staple sauces, and also for its commercial value, since she sells groundnut at the market. Fatoumata says that \"one sits down before laying down\". With her expected increased yield and income, she is planning to start raising livestock and to increase the size of her arable land.  She also says that \"the container to gather honey is always placed on top\".

Lillian\u2019s business has evolved since 1998. Lillian started her business in 1998 by selling tomatoes and vegetables along the roadside or by her gate. As her children grew, so did the needs of the family, making it hard for the father of the family to cope alone. Husband and wife had to provide food, clothing and education for their minors, developing from a small vegetable stall to a good \"tuck\" shop business selling different grocery items. Her business has over the years enabled her to educate her children up to tertiary level, with another now a nurse.\r\n\r\nThe formation of Joyous Group arose from the needs of four hardworking women to upgrade their businesses. The group attended training sessions at Thrive for about a month, and the lessons were an eye opener. Lillian admitted that she used to use business money for personal use, did not record her transactions and did not balance her books. The Thrive training has brought changes to the way that she is doing business. She feels that she is on her way to being a much better businesswoman. With her Kiva loan, Lillian plans to fully stock her \"tuck\" shop so that there is no product that is missing when clients come to buy.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Lillian is planning to grow her business from a \"tuck\" shop to a proper shop.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1890499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

","en":"Djenebablen, who is standing on the left in the picture and wearing a white shawl, is a member of a group of 7 farmers who are enrolled with myAgro and who live and work in the village of Safe Koro, in the south of Bamako in Mali. Djenebablen is 52 years old and the mother of 5 children aged between 13 and 38, 2 of whom still attend school. Djenebablen has been a farmer for 38 years and was motivated to take up agriculture because farming is a long held family tradition (it is the primary source of revenue and enables a household's food self-sufficiency) and she is married to a farmer.\r\n\r\nDjenebablen grows groundnuts and has a market garden on her plot of land but, as a farmer,  has to face problems like a lack of rain and a lack of agricultural equipment. Djenebablen is starting her second year with myAgro and has re-enrolled because of the prospect of being able to increase her yield thanks to the services provided by myAgro, and because of the positive image that myAgro has in the neighbouring villages. This year, Djenebablen will be making payments towards a packet of myAgro fertiliser to grow groundnuts so that she can increase the yield on her 0.25 hectare plot of land. Djenebablen has been growing groundnuts for 38 years because of their nutritional value, as groundnuts are directly consumable by the family and are an ingredient in a basic sauce used for food preparation. The increase of her production and revenue will allow Djenebablen to keep doing business. Finally, Djenebablen hopes to be able to cover her children's education expenses and to build a home for the family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1884640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a packet of fertiliser with which to grow groundnuts and to benefit from the training and techniques provided by myAgro.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Safe Koro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:04Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djenebablen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nieba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Konimba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dramane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":169000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":169000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":169000,"processed_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":172166.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401697}],"funded_date":"2015-05-29T10:52:10Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":891771,"name":"Rosalinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalinda works hard to support her family.

Yacouba is 65 years old and the father of 8 children aged between 12 and 38, one of whom still attends school. Yacouba has been a farmer for 53 years and was motivated to take up agriculture because farming is a long held family tradition (it is the primary source of revenue and enables a household's food self-sufficiency). Yacouba says that \"farming is our primary value.\" Yacouba grows corn and rice on his plot of land but, as a farmer, has to face problems like a lack of rain, a lack of agricultural equipment and a lack of good quality fertiliser. He says that old age is prepared for during one's youth.\r\n\r\nYacouba is starting his first year with myAgro and has enrolled because of the payment system and the good quality seeds, as well as the training and agricultural techniques provided by myAgro. This year, Yacouba will be making payments towards a package of myAgro OPV (Open Pollinated Variety) maize seeds and fertiliser so that he can increase the yield on his 1 hectare plot of land. Yacouba has been growing maize for 53 years because of its nutritional and commercial value, as maize is one of the food products he sells at the market.

the Philippines, sari-sari stores are everywhere. Sari-sari (a term used for variety) stores sell different kinds of products like biscuits, candies, canned goods, noodles, products used for personal hygiene, and the like, which are involved in every individual\u2019s daily living. This is considered as one of the most common businesses built by ordinary people since it provides commodities for people. \r\n\r\nWith this fact, Evelyn was enticed to get in touch with this kind of craft. She is 40 years old, married to Ramil, and a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. By now, they are working with determination to pursue the needs of their family. The income they get from the store helps them with their daily expenditures. \r\n\r\nHowever, what profit they get from the business is sometimes insufficient. It is because, at times, she finds it hard to maintain supplies of various products due to financial incapability. This is why she is requesting a PHP 40 000 loan that she will utilize to buy additional products for her inventory. With more products displayed in her store, she will be able to have greater increase in her income. \r\n\r\nIn due time, she hopes that she grow in progress and that her business will boost in sales. Through this, she can earn and save money for a house someday if God will allow. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is comprised of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1890363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
