She is 57 years of age and is working hard to provide for her family's needs.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Anacorita wants to make her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like to obtain a loan amounting to 25,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional grocery items that are needed. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nAnacorita  aspires to save enough money so she can improve her business and be able to help her children and grandchildren as well. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for their one and only child. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their child with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5-PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Norma would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 10,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Norma hopes to maintain an increasing profit from her business and eventually expand her sari-sari store. She also dreams for her child to complete his studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies.

She has a professional degree. Akdana started a farming business in 2008 with an investment of 2,000 som, as an additional source of income for her family. Now Akdana owns three cows and a horse and sells milk. She also farms a 0.23 hectare plot as well as rents another hectare of farm land, where she grows oats for sale.

He is enterprising, optimistic and hard-working.  He started his building materials business in Vichaya, a rural area named for a leafy plant that people here used for feeding their cattle.  The area is west of El Alto and some 4,000 meters above sea level.  It is cold and dry here, with temperatures that can vary up to 16 degrees Centigrade during the day.\r\nNicanor is dark-skinned with brown eyes and short, black hair.  He speaks both Aymara, his native language and the language he speaks at home, and Spanish.  His wife helps with his business and all of his children but the youngest are in school.  The family lives in a modest adobe house with electricity and water.  (The water is drawn by electric pump from a well.)  \r\nNicanor manufactures stucco, a fine-grained material made with quicklime, crushed marble, natural pigments that becomes very durable when mixed with water.  The finished material is used to plaster walls and ceilings.  \"My whole family works at the business . . . Even the children help when after they finish their school work\", says Nicanor.  The best thing about the business, he says, is that there is a lot of demand for stucco.  The biggest worry he faces is a shortage of fuel and water.

education \u2013 these are just some of the things going around Patrick\u2019s mind. Patrick is a 47-year-old, smallholder farmer based in Nkubu, which is a small agricultural center. He owns a small piece of land together with his lovely wife, and they have been blessed with a lovely family. On the land, they have kept poultry, cows and grown vegetables for 20 years. Their main income sources are eggs, milk and crops. They recently ventured into a small personal business. \r\n\r\nFrom Kiva lenders, Patrick is seeking a loan worth KES 20,000 to buy seeds and grow his horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. \r\n\r\nIt is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to afford Patrick access to a loan that will aid him to grow his horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Patrick\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":86.35,"image":{"id":1890247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy seeds and start horticulture farming to diversify his income and reduce vulnerability","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-05-29T20:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-28T20:30:05Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.68,"local_amount":1571.37,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1720.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378780},{"amount":12.06,"local_amount":1071.66,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1173.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588494},{"amount":18.47,"local_amount":1641.88,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1798.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506787},{"amount":38.14,"local_amount":3390,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3712.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023602}],"funded_date":"2015-06-04T13:03:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":891782,"name":"Lorna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorna is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a food vending business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 13000 through NWTF to purchase additional ingredients like peanuts, milk, sugar, etc for her food vending business.\r\n\r\nLorna has been in this business for 3 years.

Alima, 47 years old, is the mother of 7 children, ages 1 to 22 years old, two of which are currently in school. Farming is the main source of food and income for this household and allows Alima to ensure the self-sufficiency of her family. The deep traditions of agriculture in her family incited Alima to practice this activity for 13 years now. Alima grows peanuts, rice, and greens on her plot of land, but, as a farmer, she must also cope with difficulties such as lack of rain, lack of farming materials and quality fertilizer. This year, Alima is making payments to buy a package of myAgro fertilizer for growing peanuts in order to increase her yields on her .0625 hectare plot. Alima has been growing peanuts for 13 years now because of their food-producing qualities, explaining that peanuts can be eaten directly by her family and used a the base for a sauce in cooking. Alima plans to raise livestock and to buy farming materials with the increase of her yields and her revenue. Finally, Alima hopes to be able to cover the tuition costs for her children as well as ensure the self-sufficiency of the family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1883185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a package of fertilizer for growing peanuts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-29T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-28T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Batoma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adjara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amadou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Drissa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yacouba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djakaridia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chiata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salif","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Karim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Yaya","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":433500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":433500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":433500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":441468.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401702}],"funded_date":"2015-05-29T23:13:57Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett Ray","image":null}},{"id":890445,"name":"Sacarias","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sacarias es un hombre de 44 a\u00f1os de edad, casado, tiene 2 hijos varones de 1 y 8 a\u00f1os y una hija mujer de 6 a\u00f1os, y su negocio es la agricultura.\n\u00c9l es buen padre, emprendedor, independiente, paciente, solidario, responsable y muy trabajador.

His business is located in the town of Jatun Pampa located close to the road along the river.

The two oldest children go to school but the youngest is not old enough to attend school yet. <br \/><br \/>They live in a house built of adobe, brick and cement that is unfinished and has electricity and well water extracted by pump. He works in agriculture. The area where he lives is a rural area near the city.  The locals extract water from wells or collect water from the river, which is actually no longer good for consumption. \"My children are sick from drinking well water; we need drinking water as soon as possible, \" he says.<br \/><br \/>The advantage of his home is that it is located close to recently created water connections.

Her native language is spoken Guarani  which she speaks, but she generally speaks Spanish due to the culture and the nature of her work (she is found in the front row wearing white apron). \r\n\r\nThe need to improve her business led her to organize an entrepreneurs group and form a banking group with people in business such as:  motorcycle taxi service, clothes washers, vegetables sellers, food sellers, bookstore, service calls and second-hand clothes sellers to request a loan and generate better income.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling traditional food , traveling and visiting fairs and shops. The most common dishes are; majadito jerky (dried meat, rice, fried egg and fried plantain filling), Cogote (creole chicken necks, stuffing can be potato and plantain), peanut soup (soup made with peanuts), stuffed peppers (peppers, chopped meat, onions), rice with cheese (rice, milk and cheese), and others.  \"I learned to cook because of the need to help my family, I have steady customers and want to expand my business ...\" she says. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she already has established routes and regular customers, the downside is that she does not have enough capital to purchase tables, chairs and kitchen utensils.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to open a restaurant that can pay family expenses.  She wants to purchase tables, chairs and cooking utensils to be able to sell food to more customers. This is the first sequence of loans with this institution in the 15 years that she has practiced this activity.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason for which Francisca is requesting a loan,for the purchase of chairs, tables and kitchen utensils to sell food and open a restaurant.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":1888644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"in the purchase of tables, chairs and kitchen utensils for selling food and to open a restaurant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-05-29T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-28T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":3350,"lender_count":111,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marialina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carla Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1786.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1759.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1791.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1823.95},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1857.14},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1890.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1925.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1960.41},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1996.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2032.41},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2069.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2107.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.43},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290.73},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":296.03},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.41},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1313.55,"local_amount":9018.36,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:42:09Z","rounded_local_amount":9062.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344582},{"amount":555.85,"local_amount":3816.31,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3835.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554791},{"amount":576.27,"local_amount":3956.49,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3976.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468878},{"amount":904.33,"local_amount":6208.84,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:44Z","rounded_local_amount":6239.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296711}],"funded_date":"2015-06-21T01:02:34Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Zenia Tejada-Gutierrez","image":null}},{"id":890454,"name":"Flor Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Grupo De Cr\u00e9dito Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n se re\u00fane cada 15 d\u00edas en la ciudad de Manta, ciudad conocida por sus hermosas playas que son muy visitadas en toda \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o y por ser una ciudad con una belleza sin igual con muchos atractivos tur\u00edsticos.\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Flor, tiene 65 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen seis hijos mayores de edad, dos de ellos aun viven en su casa.

The myAgro agents spoke with conviction regarding the benefits of their method. \n\nThis year, Lassine is making payments to buy a pack of myAgro OPV (open pollinated variety) seeds and corn fertilizer that should increase the yield on his 0.5 hectares of land. \n\nLassine has been growing maize for its commercial value and he will sell it in the market.

Finally Setou also hopes to cover her children's school fees as well as ensure her family's food self-sufficiency."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50,"image":{"id":1889765,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy a bag of fertilizer to cultivate groundnuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Zelabougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-29T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-28T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":50,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":50,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":29942.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401629}],"funded_date":"2015-05-29T23:24:12Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":892449,"name":"Arnaldo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arnaldo is a 48-year-old high school graduate and lives in Bago City.

Nianaba, aged 68, is the mother of one child. Agriculture is the anchor of family tradition, the principal source of income and of food self-sufficiency for the household. Those facts, along with being married to a agriculturalist, have moved Nianaba to practice agriculture for 50 years now.  She mentioned, \"I am the daughter of a fine farmer.\"\n\nNianaba grows peanuts, millet, rice, and fonio (a local grain) on her plot but as a farmer, she has to face difficulties such as lack of rain, of farm supplies, and of high-quality fertilizer. She is beginning her first year with myAgro and she registered because of the system of payment and the training in agricultural techniques, as well as hoping to expand her yield through the services proposed by myAgro. \n\nThis year, Nianaba is making payments to purchase a myAgro package of fertilizer for growing peanuts so as to expand her yield on her plot of 0.125 hectare. Nianaba has been growing peanuts for their value as a foodstuff for 30 years now. She explains the peanuts are directly edible for the family, are used as a base for sauces in cooking, and also have their commercial value, since peanuts are a foodstuff she sells in the market. \n\nNianaba is counting on the increase in her yield and her revenue to raise sheep and goats. Finally, she also hopes to be able to pay for the wedding of her child.

She is part of a group of 12 farmers who are signed up for myAgro. They all live and work in the village of Bekossokoro to the southwest of Bamako in Mali. Mariam is 50 years old and the mother of 10 children between the ages of one and 14. Five of her children go to school. \r\n\r\nThe family tradition is rooted in farming, and this is their primary source of revenue and dietary self-sufficiency. This motivated Mariam to be a farmer for 18 years.  Mariam plants peanuts and does market gardening on her land. As a farmer, she must confront challenges like lack of rain, farming equipment, and herbicide.\r\n\r\nThis is Mariam's first year with myAgro. She signed up with them on account of their payment system and their quality seeds and fertilizer. This year, Mariam is buying a packet of myAgro open-pollinated variety (OPV) seeds and fertilizer for peanuts in order to increase the yield on her 1\/16 hectare plot of land. \r\n\r\nFor 10 years now, Mariam has been planting peanuts for their food-producing value. She explains that peanuts are directly consumable and that they can be used as the base for sauces. They have high commercial value and do well at the market. \r\n\r\nWith the increase in her yield and revenue, Mariam plans to begin livestock farming and expand the area of land that she plants on. In closing, Mariam hopes to cover her children\u2019s schooling fees and ensure the dietary self-sufficiency of her family.

","en":"Habi, on the left in the photo holding a myAgro packet, is a member of a group of four farmers registered at myAgro, all living and working in the village of Safe Koro in southern Bamako in Mali. Habi is 65 years old and the mother of eleven children - aged from 14 to 40 years old, two of whom currently attend school.\nA family tradition for agriculture - the main source of income and food for the family - has led Habi to work in the sector for the last 55 years. She grows peanuts, sorghum and kitchen vegetables on her plot, but as a farmer she has to cope with problems such as a lack of rain, of farming equipment and of quality fertilisers.\nHabi is into her third season with my Agro, having re-registered due to the quality seeds and fertiliser, as well as the positive reputation of myAgro in the neighbouring villages. This year she is making payments to buy a myAgro fertiliser package for growing peanuts, in order to increase the yield on her 1,250m2 piece of land. Habi has been growing peanuts for 55 years for its food value, explaining that it is both eaten by the family as is, and also used as a basic sauce in food. It also has commercial value, being a food she sells at market.\nHabi hopes that with her increased yield and higher income she will be able to ensure her family is self sufficient in food and to pay for her childrens' weddings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50,"image":{"id":1880825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

Nana has a cocoa plantation and has 16 years of farming experience. Her husband is also a cocoa farmer. She does not have any business that serves as her other source of income. The dry cocoa beans are sold to purchasing clerks who are also in the village. She became interested in the ELSA clean cookstove after the community education on deforestation and demonstration on how the clean cookstove works. The stove uses virgin pellets, which are waste material within her community. Nana has now decided to take a loan that will help her buy the stove and also save the family from trekking for a long distance in search of firewood for cooking.

This is Daneth. He is the deputy head teacher of Unique Valley Primary & Secondary Schools, a mixed school in the rural area of Kasese with 1,400 students. Unique Valley Schools has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining two UV water filtration systems to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase two UV water treatment systems with two 450 liter tanks, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nUnique Valley Schools will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Daneth ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from waterborne diseases, as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":810,"image":{"id":1891183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

She is a good mother - dedicated, patient, a good listener, responsible and very hard working. Her business is selling second-hand clothing. She started her business in the zone known as \"Plan 3000\", an area settled by the survivors of major river flooding in 1983. The migrants came in from the provinces around the country and settled in this zone that now has more than 20% of the total population. It is a poor district located 12 miles outside the city. It has basic services like healthcare and education. The climate is warm and subtropical, with daytime temperatures between 21 and 35 Celsius. <br \/><br \/>Iganicia is darker skinned with brown eyes and long brown hair tied back in a ponytail, of medium stature.  Her native language is Guarani, which is spoken at home, and she speaks Spanish in the general public and in her business. In the picture, she is fifth from the right wearing a purple flowered blouse and black capris.<br \/><br \/>She enjoys her life with her partner, who works in construction, and her son who is in school. <br \/>They live in a room made of brick and cement. They have running water, electricity and sewage. <br \/><br \/>The need to grow her business is what made her join a community bank with members in businesses such as: food sales, sewing sheets, perfume sales, bakery, cotton t-shirt sales, fruit sales and meat sales.  She wants to ask for a loan to improve her business activities. She sells second-hand clothing like pants, t-shirts, blouses, sweaters, jackets, etc. She needs to stock her business with a greater variety and quantity of clothing so that she can be more competitive in the market.  <br \/><br \/>\"I have a lot of projects in mind,\" she says, \" the first being to strengthen my clothing business.\" The advantage of her business is that clothing sales are constant; the disadvantage is the lack of capital to invest back into her business and grow it. Her dream is to open up a clothing store so that she doesn't have to go door to door anymore. She wants to use the loan to buy second-hand clothing in bulk. This is her 3rd loan cycle with the institution in the three years she's been in business. This loan to buy clothing will help her to open her store and to help her son finish school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3779.13,"image":{"id":1888650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

who place orders with her according to the sales catalogue she designed.  \r\n\r\nShe is applying for her first credikiva with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that she will invest in vases as well as fruit and animal sculptures, all made of wood. \r\n\r\nShe hopes her business will continue to grow and in the medium term she can reach her goal of organizing her own store, which will provide a better standard of living for her family, and in particular provide for her young daughter and her own personal fulfilment.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":131.33,"image":{"id":1888667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Her husband has been providing transport facilities by driving a taxi for 10 years. Her husband is responsible for fulfilling the needs of the entire family. Her husband needs to do maintenance on his taxi because the current condition of his taxi is not good. It requires more maintenance charges on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nDue to insufficient financial means, her husband is unable to maintain his taxi. Therefore, Zohra has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan, Zohra's husband can afford the maintenance cost easily and provide better transport facilities to earn a profitable income. Zohra also plans to save the profit from her husband's income to meet her family's needs in the future.\r\n\r\nZohra is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC
