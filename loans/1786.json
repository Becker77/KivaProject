In the past, she used to work for a company located in a free zone, but because of the political crisis of 2009, she was laid off in 2011 when the company shut down.

Su vida la comparte con su pareja que se dedica al mismo negocio. Viven en una casa propiedad de la familia construida de ladrillo y cemento con techo de calamina y piso de madera que cuenta con energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y agua de pozo extra\u00edda mediante una bomba el\u00e9ctrica. Su negocio es la producci\u00f3n de mermeladas de; naranja, de lim\u00f3n, de mandarina, para poder disfrutar de ellas en verano. Las naranjas ecol\u00f3gicas muy jugosas y dulces como de naranja amarga son las m\u00e1s populares. Su sabor es dulce, \u00e1cido y amargo al mismo tiempo, con un dejo refrescante, \u201ces muy importante que los c\u00edtricos sean siempre de cultivo ecol\u00f3gico. La piel de las naranjas y limones convencionales NO es comestible por su alto contenido en pesticidas y productos qu\u00edmicos\u2026\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que las mermeladas comerciales tienen much\u00edsimo az\u00facar, m\u00e1s del 60% y un mont\u00f3n de ingredientes extra\u00f1os, la desventaja es la falta de capital de inversi\u00f3n. Su sue\u00f1o es establecer su negocio como peque\u00f1a industria artesanal, \u00e9l desea realizar la compra de herramientas y equipo para producir mermeladas y as\u00ed conseguir su licencia sanitaria para ampliar su mercado. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 2 a\u00f1os que realiza esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Boris solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de herramientas para producir mermelada artesanal y obtener su licencia sanitaria.\n","en":"Boris is a 34 year old man. He lives with his spouse, with no children. His business is making jams. He is enterprising, independent, stable, optimist, responsible, and very hardworking. He runs his business in an area called \u2018Villa Salom\u00e9\u2019, characterized by being connected to the rest of the city by a narrow road. Fifty percent of the area has plumbing and potable water. The other half gets water from a well. It has a cold, dry climate with a temperature that varies during the day between -1 to 16 degrees centigrade. \r\n\r\nBoris has dark skin, brown eyes, short black hair, a short stature, and a medium build. His mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1, which he speaks in his family. He speaks Spanish in the general culture and for business. He shares his life with his spouse, who works at the same business. They lives in a family owned house built from bricks and cement with a metal sheeting roof and a wooden floor. It has electricity and a water well that has an electric pump.  His business is making marmalades from oranges, lemons, and tangerines, to enjoy in summer. Organic oranges are very juicy and sweet and jams like tart orange jam are the most popular. Its flavor is sweet, acid and tart all at the same time, with a refreshing aftertaste. \u201cIt is very important that the citrus always be organic. The peels of conventional oranges and lemons are NOT edible due to their high content of pesticides and chemical products.\" he remarks. The advantage the business has is that commercial marmalades have a lot of sugar, more than 60%, plus a lot of strange ingredients. The disadvantage is a lack of investment capital. His dream is to establish a business as a small artisanal industry. He wants to buy tools and equipment to produce marmalades and thus get his health license to widen his market. This is his first loan sequence with the institution in the two years he has been doing this activity. \r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Boris is asking for a loan to buy tools to produce artisanal marmalade and to get his health license. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1888847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tools to make artisanal marmalade and to get his health license.

around the farm. She has a high school education and has been raising livestock and planting crops for 20 years. She is very pleasant and kind by nature, also responsible and hardworking. She has a cow and 25 sheep and sells milk on a daily basis.

The family lives in Yoro, a small town in El Progreso.  Rubia has operated a retail business for 4 years.  She sells clothing, for both children and adults, lotions, creams, cosmetics, purses and other merchandise.  She works as a street vendor, going block to block, and also sells merchandise to order.  The business is her sole means of supporting her family.  Rubia is applying for a 15,000-lempira loan that she will use to buy clothing and lotions for resale.

This is Doviko. He is the head teacher of Mubuku Valley Secondary School, a mixed school in the rural area of Kasese with 710 students.\r\n\r\nMubuku School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining two UV water filtration systems to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children.\r\n\r\nInstalling a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the longterm as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

She is starting her first year with myAgro and registered herself so that she could increase production through the services provided by myAgro and due to the positive image myAgro has within the neighbouring villages.  \r\n\r\nThis year Kadia is making payments to buy a packet of myAgro OPV seeds and fertiliser to grow valuable peanuts.  She explains that the peanuts are eaten by the family and used as a sauce base in cooking and also used for their commercial value as they can be sold in the market.  She plans to increase her production and her profit to raise goats in order to diversify the crops like sorghum.  \r\n\r\nEssentially Kadia hopes to be able to afford to pay for her children's marriages.  Kanta , a member of another myAgro group in Congola, is also present in the photo.  She is so enthusiastic that she insisted on being in the photo.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1886516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a packet of OPV seeds to grow peanuts and to increase productivity in her plot.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"congola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-05-30T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-29T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nahan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nakani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Berete","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Konate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Morifing","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Soumaila","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mamadou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Zoumana","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":378000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":378000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":378000,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:21Z","rounded_local_amount":382606.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401705}],"funded_date":"2015-05-30T20:28:07Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Oliver Spink","image":1725459}},{"id":888734,"name":"Jiguis\u00e8m\u00e8 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Nassira est la femme qui est entrain d\u2019arroser avec de l\u2019arrosoir.\n Nassira est une paysanne Malienne \u00e2g\u00e9e de 43 ans qui vit  dans le milieu rural avec sa famille.\nElle est mari\u00e9e.

She operates a business buying cosmetics that she orders from a catalog and reselling them to her buyers.  She is enterprising, responsible and hard-working.  She built her business in the south of the city, working its poor neighborhoods of modest houses and few services, often cheek and jowl with small factories and other commercial businesses.  It's hot here and day-time temperatures range from 21- to 35-degrees, Centigrade or 70- to 92-degrees, Fahrenheit.  \r\nMarisol is a brown-skinned woman with brown eyes and long, black hair. (In the photo, Marisol is the second woman from the right, in a pink blouse and black pants.)  She speaks Guarani, her native language, and Spanish.  Marisol's son is in school and they live in a modest house of brick and cement.  The house has a metal roof and a cement floor.  They have basic services, as well: water, electricity, sewage.  \r\nMarisol is a street vendor.  She sells beauty products that she buys from Avon, Mary Kay, Jafra and other well-known cosmetics brands.  She works during the week, going from street to street and market to market.  The products that are most in demand, she says, are earrings, lipstick, anti-aging creams, facial treatments, perfumes, mascara, etc.  \"I started with very little capital and I've slowly added merchandise\", she says.  \"Now I have display cases and spaces for displaying my merchandise\".  The advantage she has is that she can collect from her buyers before she submits their orders to her suppliers.  Her biggest problem, on the other hand, is that she doesn't have the capital to buy bulk supplies of merchandise at wholesale costs.  She wants to become a wholesaler herself but to do so she will need to stock supplies of the merchandise she sells.\r\nMarisol has operated her business for 10 years and this is her 13th loan.  She will use it to buy bulk supplies of cosmetics and transform her business from retailing to wholesaling.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4600,"image":{"id":1888899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy wholesale supplies of cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-05-30T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-29T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":4600,"lender_count":81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Antoniet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor Alfonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isavel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-24T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":31500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-18T04:00:00Z","amount":4170.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T04:00:00Z","amount":4158.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T04:00:00Z","amount":4310.04},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":4466.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T04:00:00Z","amount":4629.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T04:00:00Z","amount":4798.03},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T04:00:00Z","amount":4966.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":609.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":629.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":652.31},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":676.06},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1216.35,"local_amount":8329.32,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":8344.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344589},{"amount":629.4,"local_amount":4310.04,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4317.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554798},{"amount":652.31,"local_amount":4466.92,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4474.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468885},{"amount":676.06,"local_amount":4629.52,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4637.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296718},{"amount":1425.88,"local_amount":9764.2,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:33Z","rounded_local_amount":9781.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076885}],"funded_date":"2015-06-25T14:24:07Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":889112,"name":"Bon Berger Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mbambu est commer\u00e7ante, membre de la banque villageoise \u00abBon Berger\u00bb, cliente de l\u2019IMF Hekima, mari\u00e9e, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 33 ans, m\u00e8re 4 enfants dont 3 \u00e9tudient et 1 est encore gosse.

This is Charles. He is the director of Zigoti Standard Primary School, a mixed school with 500 students in the rural area of Zigoti in Mityana. \r\n\r\nZigoti School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistently clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750-litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nZigoti School will repay its loan from the school fees it collects each term. Charles ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children who fall sick from water-borne diseases, as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1891326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mityana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.4175 32.022778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-05-30T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-29T18:10:04Z","loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.86,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zigoti School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5610000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1122000},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1122000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1122000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1122000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1122000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1122000,"processed_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1130625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681370963},{"amount":371.14,"local_amount":1122000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1130625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.86,"payment_id":755507213}],"funded_date":"2015-06-01T21:42:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Fitzgerald","image":null}},{"id":889241,"name":"Nuru Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mabengwa est commer\u00e7ante, vice pr\u00e9sident de la banque villageoise \u00abNuru\u00bb, cliente de l\u2019IMF Hekima, mari\u00e9e, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 38 ans, m\u00e8re 9 enfants tous \u00e9tudient.

Florence thanks Ugafode for the financial assistance which has enabled her to construct a house for herself which she could not afford using her salary alone."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":187.5,"image":{"id":1891324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy shutters to complete her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2015-05-30T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-06-29T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.24,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2016-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2016-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2016-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2016-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111111.11},{"due_date":"2016-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":111111.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":111111.11,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":113062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681546370},{"amount":35.13,"local_amount":111111.11,"processed_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":113062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.37,"payment_id":696786363},{"amount":34.08,"local_amount":111111.11,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-24T12:20:33Z","rounded_local_amount":113062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.42,"payment_id":714046982},{"amount":34.59,"local_amount":111111.11,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-23T12:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":113062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.91,"payment_id":732673741},{"amount":36.96,"local_amount":111111.11,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-22T13:15:37Z","rounded_local_amount":113062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.54,"payment_id":754866552}],"funded_date":"2015-06-19T03:06:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":892726,"name":"Tareq","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tareq is a 47-year-old married man from Rafah city.

During school vacation periods, sales fall,\u201d she comments.  The advantage of her business is that she has periods of strong sales.  The disadvantage is the lack of money to stock up her business during high sales periods.  Her dream is to expand her kiosk space.

She lives with her partner, has no children, and she is in the hamburger sales business.  Inelda is enterprising, independent, persevering, optimistic, responsible, and very hardworking.   She is developing her business in \u201cPlan 3000\u201d, an area settled by the survivors of the river flooding in 1983, and situated 12 kilometers from the city center.\r\n\r\nInelda is short and thin with a dark complexion, brown eyes, and long chestnut hair that she wears tied back.  Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, and she speaks Spanish with the general population and for her business.  (She is seated in the center wearing a black blouse).  She shares her life with her partner, who works in trade.  They live in a rented room made of brick and cement, with a corrugated iron roof, and a cement floor that has potable water, electricity, and a sewer system.  \r\n\r\nInelda\u2019s desire to succeed compelled her to lead a communal bank of people with businesses such as blanket weaving, cheese production, as well as fish, baked goods, secondhand clothing, noodle, and chicken sales to request loans and improve their businesses.  Her business is selling hamburgers, and she covers different markets and businesses pushing her cart.  \u201cI started my business out of the need to become independent.  I work every day, and I wish to open a shop so that I can stop selling on foot\u201d she says.  Her business\u2019s advantage is that sales are steady, however, the disadvantage is that she doesn\u2019t have investment capital to expand her business.

She rents washing machines, a very useful service here because not all of her neighbors can afford washing machines of their own.  She started the business with the clear idea that she could both earn a living and care for her sons at the same time.  The boys are now old enough to earn money for school and are looking for work.  Alicia and her husband pay other family expenses and are saving for a sturdier-built house.\r\n\r\nAlicia is applying for a loan that she will use to buy spare parts for the washing machines that she rents.  The machines become damaged over time as they are moved around and not all of her customers are as careful with them as others.  She also wants to buy another washing machine.\r\n\r\nYour help will allow this enterprising woman to carry on and grow her

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nMityana Standard School will repay their loan from the school fees, which they collect each term.

All the financial institutions rejected her loan requests because of her unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Roza applied for the credit to MFO Credo. Her request was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses. \r\nRoza will purchase clothing stock of various kinds at wholesale prices in the capital, where the country's largest market is located.

","en":"This photograph shows a 37 year old Khujand resident named Saodat. Saodat is a beginning entrepreneur. She has been selling women's clothing for almost a year.

She has a secondary vocational education and is now receiving a pension though she continues to work as a school teacher. Anvarhan also raises livestock to earn money for her family. She started this business in 2010, and thanks to her dedication, perseverance, and hard work she currently owns four cows and 15 sheep. The business produces a monthly income around 12,000 som (KGS). Anvarhan is asking the Bai-Tushum bank for a 50,000 som (KGS) loan to buy sheep, since the price of livestock has fallen. Anvarhan plans to use income from use of the loan on home repairs.

Originally from the city of Bilwi in the Puerto Cabezas municipality, she is of Creole ethnicity. She is married with 2 children. The eldest, 12 years old, is in his second year of middle school and the youngest, 10 years old, is in sixth grade. Her husband is a dentist. \r\n\r\nShe established her beauty salon 4 years ago, generating her own income with which she financially contributes to her household. Given the difficulty in accessing credit without physical collateral, she coordinated the Stefanny communal bank for a period of 4 years.
