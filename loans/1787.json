She has been engaged in that kind of business for three years now.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan of 10,000 PHP to purchase additional supplies of frozen goods, like lumpia and longaniza.

She has two children ages 9 and 16, and her business is selling traditional food. She's a good mother, generous, understanding, a good listener, supportive, responsible, and very hard-working. She does her work at the market in the \"Mutualista\" area, a central area known for its proximity to the dog race track which has a seating capacity of 30 thousand and is a thousand meters long. It's where the carnival, parades and other cultural activities take place. The climate is warm and sub-tropical with a temperature that varies between 21-35 degrees throughout the day. Dilcy is dark-skinned with gray eyes, and long black hair that she ties behind her head. She's of medium build and height and her native tongue is Guarani which she speaks amongst family, and she speaks spanish because of the prevailing culture and the work that she does (she's located on the right, wearing a lilac blouse). She shares her life with her partner who works in construction and with her children who are attending school. They live in a house of their own with potable water, electricity, and sewage. Her desire for self-improvement led her to form a group with people whose businesses are: selling pajamas, selling sandals, selling secondhand clothes, homeopathic medicines, vehicle upholstery, smoothies, cell phone cases and coca leaves, to apply for a loan and expand their businesses. Her business is the sale of traditional dishes such as; locro (a soup with dried meat, sliced meat, yucca and eggs), majao (ground jerky, boiled bananas and rice), rice and cheese (rice, milk, and cheese) pork belly aji (pork belly, onions, and tomatoes served with rice). It's a job that she carries out every day of the week at her stand, \"I always cooked and recently I worked up the nerve to build my own establishment, which currently has loyal customers that buy every day\" she says. The advantage of her business is that the selling is daily, the disadvantage is the lack of furniture with which she could serve more customers. Her dream is to be the favorite business of her customers. She wants to expand her business through the purchase of tables and chairs to serve more customers. She's in the second cycle of loans with the institution in the 4 years that she's been in this line of work. These are the reasons that Dilcy is requesting a loan to purchase tables and chairs to serve more customers and be the favorite business in the area.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":1889705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has been happily married to Pedro for 23 years. He builds houses and together they have created a family of four children, three of whom are students. She has one daughter who is a university student, one who is in high school and another in junior high. \"My expenses are substantial because I have to pay my daughters' tuition but I rely on my animals to earn money so I can get ahead.\" \r\n\r\nLaura currently is raising and selling sheep; she buys them when they are very small and sometimes they are born to sheep she already has. She has had up to 13 sheep at one time. Laura does not have to spend money on feed for her animals because she is able to take advantage of the extensive grasslands in her area. Her main customers are people from other communities who value her work.\r\n\r\nLaura is very grateful to VisionFund because her first loan allowed her to start up her business. She remembers that she purchased two lambs and pasture land with two thousand pesos. Today her business allows her to pay her children's educational expenses and also to buy shoes, clothing and to cover other expenses. Her goal is to be able to start a business raising calves. She laughingly commented, \"I hope to have a bridge of animals one day.\" \r\n\r\nWith the opportunity provided by the loan she will buy pasture land and five medium-sized sheep that she will sell in three months. The other members of the group are Elvira, Rosa, Basilia and Patricia who plan to invest in sheep. Esmeralda will invest in dishes. *The photograph was taken on the steps of the town kiosk. Laura is the one wearing a pink sweater."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5375,"image":{"id":1880982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

The biggest festival takes place on February 2nd, the day of Candelaria, when a majority of the people get together to celebrate.\r\n\r\nRosa is a serious person who's focused on her work.

She noticed that it was a very profitable business and decided to launch her own business to help with family expenses and her childrens' education. To this end she purchases the animals when they're small and raises them for four months, then she sells the animals whole or by the kilogram. \"I've always invested in my business and with the profits I've been able to support my family. I also upgraded my home, which now has two floors\" says Rosa, although another one of her goals is to save money and buy new furniture. Rosa's only difficulty is the price of feed for the pigs, but the loan always helps her get through this situation.

Previously, Santos worked at the City Hall helping with projects for community development.\r\n\r\nSantos is requesting this loan to buy sand, cement, iron, and stone to build a wall in the school where she works.

Also he would purchase organic fertilizers and other products to apply on his crop, in addition to hiring workers to apply those products and help with the farming once it's developed, and thus ensure that the job gets done well. His objective is to take advantage of the favorable climate conditions and soil that the area has for this crop, and also put to use the many years of experience he has in managing these crops. Also he would be able to buy the best products of the highest quality so that his farm can develop well and cleanly, as well as harvest high quality plants and have substantial production in the short term. He will use the income he hopes to receive from the harvest on his family's welfare and education, as well as take care of some family goals and continue to invest in the crops. This is the first loan that he has received from FUDECOSUR. He didn't get other loans from state banks, but FUDECOSUR has provided him a loan with easier terms and a much lower interest rate."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1889764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

It\u2019s a market that is much visited by shoppers from the entire city. It has a warm sub-tropical climate, with a daytime temperature that varies between 21 and 35 degrees Centigrade.\r\n\r\nSonia has tan skin, brown eyes, and long, straight, black hair that she wears tied back at the nape of her neck, and her height and build are medium.

She is on the left, wearing a green t-shirt. \r\n \r\nShe shares her life with her partner, who is a chauffeur, and with her children. The oldest is studying in school and the younger ones are not yet school-age. They live in a rented home built of brick and cement, with a corrugated iron roof and a cement floor. It has potable water, electricity, and a sewerage system. \r\n\r\nHer need to pay her children\u2019s medical expenses led her to organize a group of people with businesses such as, selling natural medicines; weaving, making straw hats; selling coca leaves; selling second hand clothing; a neighborhood store, and selling shoes, in order to request a loan and improve their businesses.   \r\n\r\nHer business is selling traditional food such as, majadito de charque (dried beef, rice, fried egg, and fried plantain); sopa de remojado (egg soup), locotos rellenos (peppers, ground beef, and onion); arroz con queso (rice, milk, and cheese), and aj\u00ed de panza (tripe, onions, and tomato, with rice). \r\n\r\nShe works week days in her stationary, covered, sales stand.

For this reason they are applying for a loan to be able to buy materials like cement, stones, iron and blocks. \r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to be able to finish construction of her house so that her children can have better living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":333.34,"image":{"id":1889856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials like cement, stone, iron and blocks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Quiche","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2015-06-01T01:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-01T01:20:05Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:18:49Z","rounded_local_amount":511.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681267984},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":511.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696477766},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:20:12Z","rounded_local_amount":511.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711385418},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":511.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731215510},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":511.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752000998}],"funded_date":"2015-06-03T05:16:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Verna Krishnamurthy","image":1691630}},{"id":893568,"name":"Dilber","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Dilber is 51 years old.
