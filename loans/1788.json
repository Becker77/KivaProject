Most of the locals grow corn and raise animals such as chickens, turkeys, pigs, rabbits, sheep, calves, etc.\r\n\r\nCatalina is known for being a very dedicated woman.

They could easily cover their household expenses with the income earned. Cata says, \"Thirty years ago, my father gave me a small calf, bred from one of his cows\", and so Cata began her own business. \r\n\r\nCata intends to use the loan provided by VisionFund to buy three medium-sized calves and enough feed to sell them as soon as possible. She generally only keeps animals half a year until they are ready to sell.\r\n \r\nCata wants to continue her business because it's very good, and one of her goals is to see it grow in order to improve her home and her quality of life. \"My husband works in the field often, but he is very poorly paid, and our animals help us get ahead,\" Cata says.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Anayeli, Remedios and Rosio, who will also invest in breeding and fattening calves.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken on the steps of the pavilion.

Nyakasanga School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water-filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water-filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

To Vincent it seemed like a really great idea, he accepted and know has learned very well the raising of worms in order to produce organic fertilizer, known as wormery or worm-compost which he puts on sale. The worms feed on the fruits and vegetable which Vicente provides which results in  a fertilizer which is of greater benefit than those with chemical products.\r\n\r\n  \r\nA few months ago, Vicente had an accident which distanced him from his business and his wife is who carries on the process of wormery while Vicente recuperates. \"When I began the business, Do\u00f1a Domitila gave me only two kilos of worms\" he comments, now thanks to her his production has grown to 50 kilos of worms.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Vicente does not have an infrastructure or greenhouse which allows him to grow worms for which reason he uses whatever container that is not used. With the loan he will buy rubber and metal tubes to start setting the bases of his greenhouse since he dreams of having a structure set up which  will help him to increase production.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are Do\u00f1a Domitila and Ram\u00f3n who will invest in worms, Teresa in soft drinks and Cornelio in shoes.\r\n*The photograph was taken in the garden of the mayor, Don Vicente is using crutches*\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5050,"image":{"id":1888519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"WIll buy rubber and metal tubes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Lorenzo Toxico, Ixtlahuaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-06-01T02:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-01T02:40:04Z","loan_amount":5050,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicente","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Ramon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cornelio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Domitila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":77000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":5050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6962.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":7117.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7274.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7436.14},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":7600.98},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":7769.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":7941.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8117.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8297.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":8481.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":466.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":477.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":498.51},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":509.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":520.85},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":532.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":544.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":556.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1904.79,"local_amount":29043.3,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:21:26Z","rounded_local_amount":29068.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682141095},{"amount":1008.85,"local_amount":15382.54,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":15395.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768229},{"amount":1054.08,"local_amount":16072.05,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:36:24Z","rounded_local_amount":16086.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701279},{"amount":1082.28,"local_amount":16502.11,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":16516.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204374}],"funded_date":"2015-06-16T00:33:59Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T17:57:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andre Seward","image":null}},{"id":891459,"name":"Leoncio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio Leoncio se dedica al trabajo como maestro de construccion, el socio hace trabajo como pintados de casas y arregla casas, el socio trabaja desde las 6:00 a.m hasta las 7:00 p.m,el socio por medio de este trabaja saca adelante a su familia, el sue\u00f1o el socio es tener una empresa de construccion.El socio solicita el cr\u00e9dito para comprar herramientas para construcci\u00f3n como cemento, yeso y arena.\n\nEl socio est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.","en":"The member Leoncio makes a living by working as a construction foreman, he works as a house painter as well as repairman, he works from 6:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m., through this work he is able to provide for his family, his dream is to have a construction company.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

Her husband gets 300 GEL fixed salary per month which is hardly enough to cover the basic needs of a 6 member family, so the family lives in poverty. \r\n\r\nDue to the above mentioned situation, Shorena wants to help her husband in covering some of their family's needs.  In the region there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make a living.  So, she decided to start a clothing trading business with the loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. With the loan of 800 USD, she will purchase clothing at wholesale price and sell them in her community door-to-door. \r\n\r\nShorena will get the chance to gain financial stability and earn a monthly income from her clients through the district. She will improve the family's living condition and give her children a good education to progress in life. \r\n\r\nShorena awaits your support.

Imelda elabora todo tipo de ropa como pantalones, su\u00e9teres, uniformes, faldas, blusas, chalecos, entre otras.

The members chose the name because it's the nickname of the daughter of one of the members whom they love very much.  The community is known because of the residents who make handmade crafts with wool.  Throughout the year they make a variety of garments such as caps, gloves, scarves, and leg warmers.\r\n\r\nThe members are nervous but excited because it's the first time they've asked VisionFund for a loan.  Imelda is the group representative.  She's very happy and hardworking, despite her young age.  She's always concerned with her family's well-being.  She has been married to Pablo for nine years and together they have a family with two little girls who are currently in elementary school.\r\n\r\nImelda opened a tailor shop eight years ago because her husband's parents are in the same line of work and it was very productive.  With effort and perseverance, Imelda and her husband managed to buy the first machines, and now they are known among the best dressmakers in the region.  Imelda makes all types of clothing: pants, sweaters, uniforms, skirts, blouses, vests, and other garments.  She makes sales to order or they go out to plazas to sell merchandise to the public in general.\r\n\r\n\"We start working in the shop very early every day because if we have pending orders we have to work as quickly as possible to meet the deadline and satisfy the client,\" commented Imelda, who's always in a good mood.  Her goal is to grow her business so she can offer work opportunities to more people and have the help she needs to satisfy customer demand.\r\n\r\nWith the loan Imelda will be able to get fabric, zippers, needles, thread, elastic, and the like to make uniforms, because July and August are the months in which she has most demand for this type of merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group and their investments are Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles C. and Yanet, a tailor shop; Carmen, clothing; Ver\u00f3nica, chickens, Ana Karen, a repair shop; Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles P., a nutritional group; Daniel, sound equipment; and Diana, furniture.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken on the steps of the bandstand.

She had strengthened her knowledge of sewing at CEFOR, even to the professional level. Then she took microfinance investment training. She currently owns three sewing machines: two lockstitch and one overlock. And her wish is even to be able to build a small enterprise and to create jobs. \r\n\r\nNadia Michelle is married and her husband is a shoemaker working on his own. He has motivated her to put her knowledge to work to help support the family. They have two children, aged 23 and 20. The older one is already married and no longer in their care. But the younger is still in school at a private university; he still needs support from his parents, especially financially, in preparation for his thesis and dissertation.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":129.1,"image":{"id":1887381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase different kinds of fabrics, thread, buttons, elastic, lace, ribbon, etc. ...","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MG","country":"Madagascar","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-20 47","type":"point"}},"partner_id":443,"posted_date":"2015-06-01T04:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-01T04:40:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"H.

He grows and sells potatoes for a living.  He is an entrepreneur who is dedicated, consistent, patient, optimistic, responsible and very hard-working.  His farmland is in a place called \"Batallas\" located 50 kilometers from the city.  It is known as the birthplace of the \"marraqueta\" which is the traditional bread.  The villagers grow tubers such as potato, chu\u00f1o, tunta; also make cheese, fresh milk, and produce farming tools.  The climate is cold and dry, and the altitude is 3,985 meters above sea level.\r\n\r\nSixto has a dark complexion, brown eyes, short black hair, is short in height, has a robust physique and his mother tongue is Aymara which is spoken locally.  He speaks Spanish for general purposes and because of the commerce he does.  He lives with his wife who does the same type of work.  They live in their own adobe house which has a zinc roof and brick floor.  It has electricity and well water but no sewage.\r\n\r\nHis business is producing and selling potatoes, which is a millenary activity that has been passed down through the generations and is a fundamental part of community life, \"When I was a boy I would plant potatoes with my grandparents; they were for us to eat not to sell.  Now the \"Waycha\" and \"Janku\" potatoes spoil quickly because of excess water, while the \"Imilla negra\" does not need much water.  It is stronger and can resist a drought...\" he says.

She is also very hardworking. For a year, she has been married to Andr\u00e9s, who works in home construction. Together they have started a family with a little boy who is not in school yet. \r\n\r\nSara has been buying and selling fantasy items such as pins, rings, brushes, mirrors, earrings, threads and fabrics. She has also started selling some school supplies. She started her business because in her community there was no one who offered these products and she opened up a little stall next to a hardware store. Gradually, her business grew and she was able to rent a small locale close to the main road.\r\n\r\nShe opens her business every day very early.  \u201cIt's really going well for me.

Sara's only goal is to be able to grow and sell wholesale and thus obtain income to help with the household expenses and improve her home. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will be able to buy school supplies such as notebooks, pens, crayons, and erasers. The new school year will start in August and that is a good sales season for Sara.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the members of the El Pedregal group are Ver\u00f3nica and Margarita, who will invest  in their general store; Eusebia and Josefina, in fruits and vegetables; Catalina, in jewelry; Maribel in Mexican traditional foods; and Beatriz will invest in clothing. \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in Ver\u00f3nica's store.

This is Hamami, one of Ruma\u2019s agents. Hamami lives in Cilegon, Banten, located about two hours drive from Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. He is happily married. Together with his wife, they have three children. \r\n\r\nHamami sells mobile airtime credits and provides bill payment services for his community. He joined Ruma almost a year ago. He knew Ruma from Ruma\u2019s sales executive that came to his stall. Hamami is a kind and hardworking person. His community sees him as a trusted and informative mobile provider. \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Hamami is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits and bill payment services to his community.

Los habitantes son famosos por tener un trato amable con cualquier visitante adem\u00e1s de tener muy arraigadas sus fiestas y tradiciones. La actividad econ\u00f3mica que sobresale es la agricultura y la cr\u00eda de animales de corral. \n   Do\u00f1a Hilaria es una mujer reservada, pero tambi\u00e9n llena de energ\u00eda y amabilidad. Est\u00e1 casada desde hace veintitr\u00e9s a\u00f1os con el se\u00f1or Gregorio quien trabaja en la construcci\u00f3n, la pareja form\u00f3 una familia con seis hijos de los cuales tres aun dependen de ellos.\n   Hace nueve a\u00f1os, Hilaria escuch\u00f3 hablar de VisionFund y decidi\u00f3 solicitar su primer pr\u00e9stamo para la cr\u00eda y engorda de borregos pues tiene veinte a\u00f1os de experiencia en esta actividad. En la comunidad es muy com\u00fan criar ovinos ya que dif\u00edcilmente llegan a enfermar y el alimento se aprovecha de la gran extensi\u00f3n de campo. Desde muy temprano, Hilaria se levanta a trabajar, barre el espacio de sus animales, a mediod\u00eda los saca a pastar al campo mientras ella aprovecha el tiempo para hacer la limpieza de su casa. Una vez que el sol comienza a ponerse, nuevamente los lleva de regreso a su corral. A Do\u00f1a Hilaria le encanta su trabajo porque desde peque\u00f1a se involucr\u00f3 junto con sus padres a realizarlo. Las ganancias le ayudan a solventar los gastos del hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de sus ni\u00f1os, pero ahora necesita invertir en animales peque\u00f1os para seguir criando y para ello ha solicitado un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo que le permitir\u00e1 continuar con su actividad. \n   Juan, Ra\u00fal, y Julia,  los dem\u00e1s miembros del grupo, tambi\u00e9n se dedican a la cr\u00eda de borregos. Todos ellos tienen una amplia experiencia cuidando animales y saben que la mejor \u00e9poca en ventas llegar\u00e1 pronto con las fiestas y celebraciones de fin de a\u00f1o por lo que es momento de comenzar a prepararse y comprar animales para que est\u00e9n listos en los \u00faltimos meses del a\u00f1o. El grupo agradece a VisionFund y a KIVA por la ayuda para mejorar sus negocios y su calidad de vida. \n\n*La fotograf\u00eda se tom\u00f3 en el jard\u00edn del municipio, Do\u00f1a Hilaria es quien viste la falda rosa*\n","en":"There's a community in the state of Mexico that preserves the Mazahua language and culture.  The residents are famous for their friendly treatment of visitors as well as for their deeply rooted festivals and traditions.  The main economic activity is agriculture and raising small animals.\r\n\r\nHilaria's a very reserved woman, but also full of energy and courtesy.  She has been married for 23 years to Gregorio, who works in construction.  The couple had a family of six children, three of whom are still dependent.\r\n\r\nHilaria heard of VisionFund nine years ago and decided to request her first loan to raise and fatten sheep, because she had 20 years of experience in that line of work.  In the community it's very common to raise sheep because they don't get sick easily and their food comes from the wide expanse of fields.  Hilaria rises very early for work, sweeps her animals' corral, and takes them out to graze in the field at noon while she makes the most of the time to clean her house.  Once the sun starts to set she returns the sheep to their corral.\r\n\r\nHilaria loves her work because she did it with her parents from a very young age.  Her earnings help pay for the household expenses and her children's education.  But now she needs to invest in small animals to keep working, so she requested a new loan.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group, Juan, Ra\u00fal, and Julia, also earn a living raising sheep.  They all have wide experience taking care of animals and they know the best season for sales is coming soon with the end-of-year festivals and celebrations, so now is the time to start getting ready and buying animals to be ready in the last months of the year.  The group is grateful to VisionFund and Kiva for their help in improving their businesses and quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken in the town square.  Hilaria's wearing a pink skirt.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3740.19,"image":{"id":1888597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Miguel La Labor, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-06-01T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-01T13:10:01Z","loan_amount":4600,"lender_count":143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10291.85},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10891.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11331.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11887.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":12511.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":13085.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":676.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":715.73},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":744.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":781.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":822.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":859.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":676.34,"local_amount":10292.17,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":10321.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682141097},{"amount":715.71,"local_amount":10891.56,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:56:38Z","rounded_local_amount":10922.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768231},{"amount":744.69,"local_amount":11332.25,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":11364.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701281},{"amount":781.22,"local_amount":11888.16,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":11922.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204375},{"amount":822.23,"local_amount":12512.2,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":12547.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291831}],"funded_date":"2015-06-18T20:53:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":893457,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\r\nRuth is 40 years a resident of Kabaseke Kyotera in Rakai district, married with 7 children who all attend school. \r\nShe carries out a business of charcoal selling which she started in 2011.\r\nShe works the 7 days of the week and 12 hours per day and she started this business with the aim of increasing her daily income to adequately meet her family financial obligations.\r\n\r\n Ruth wants a loan of 500,000\/= to buy more stock for her business.

This is Kosasih, one of Ruma\u2019s agents. Kosasih lives in West Bandung, a suburban area located about 3 hour\u2019s drive from Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. He is happily married and he owns a stall that sells mobile airtime credits for his community. He has already joined Ruma for almost a year. He knew Ruma from Ruma\u2019s sales executive that came to his stall. \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Kosasih is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits to his community. Having known about the importance of this loan, your loan will be very useful to help Kosasih improves his business and accordingly, his community who needs access to such services.

She has been working there for nine long years that proves her patience and dedication to work. As Assistant Line Leader, her job includes supervision of co-workers in addition to the usual washing of garments and washing machines. It\u2019s challenging for her to supervise some disobedient co-workers but she can manage them efficiently.\r\n\r\nRona is still single, but her responsibilities in the family cannot be discounted. In the Philippines where families are known to be so closely knit, single persons are expected to help in their family\u2019s expenses, from basic needs such as food, utilities, siblings\u2019 education, transportation, and incidentals like medication and hospitalization. However, the usual dilemma of low-income earners like Rona is that their salaries cannot suffice to meet their basic needs much less afford incidental expenses like medication or hospitalization. In times of huge financial needs, Rona was drawn to usurious money-lenders who charged her with very high interest rate and captured her automated teller machine (ATM) card as loan collateral. Rona has been longing to pay the balance of her debt and eventually recover her ATM card. She\u2019s a member of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative* where she gained the inspiration to save and acquired more skills in budgeting. She is very much looking forward to your help so she can pay her debt, start anew, and save efficiently so she can better help her family. \r\n\r\nAs a responsible and loving daughter, Rona wishes that her mother may have a longer life. She hopes to have her own happy family in the future with decent and better living condition. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and work. *The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services. **CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before they start their daily work routines. Bible readings, prayer devotions, and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1892955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy the basic needs of her family, pay her debts, and recover her ATM card ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-01T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-01T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2980.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314470},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523167},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433596},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954529},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.3,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044492}],"funded_date":"2015-06-03T13:28:57Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Devashini Satiananden","image":401253}},{"id":893992,"name":"Epifania","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Epifania is 50 years old and married with eight children.

Cavite. Aside from sewing, her responsibilities include cleaning and maintaining the sewing machines. She\u2019s married to Juanito, a driver, and they are blessed with three children. Igleceria\u2019s minimum wage combined with her husband\u2019s irregular income as a driver cannot meet their growing financial needs. They can provide for basic needs such as food and utilities, but they struggle financially when it comes to their children\u2019s education. Moreover, house repair and improvements lag behind other priorities. With the typhoons that swept the Philippines, their house has been in disrepair. They want to restore and improve their house but their budget priorities are for meeting their basic needs and paying for their children\u2019s education. Also, they no longer want to be enslaved to usurious money-lenders who charge very high interest rates and seize their automated teller machine (ATM) card as loan collateral. It is a blessing that Igleceria became a member of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative* where she got the information that there are other options to acquire a loan. With your kind help she can now have the opportunity to restore and improve their house, a home to their happy family.  \r\n\r\nIgleceria dreams for their children to finish their education as it is their most valued inheritance. With a college degree, they have a better chance to escape poverty. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and work. *The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services. **CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before they start their daily work routines.

is from Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite and has been employed as a seamstress in a garment factory in GMA, Cavite for 11 years now. She basically sews clothes, maintains the sewing machines, and performs other tasks requested of her. She\u2019s married to Glicerio, and they have three children. Anselma\u2019s minimum wage combined with her husband\u2019s irregular income cannot meet their growing financial needs. Anselma\u2019s income usually goes to basic needs such as food and utilities, and she barely earns enough for their children\u2019s education. Moreover, when urgent needs arise, Anselma has no access to banks and other financial institutions. When her mother died lately, Anselma had to borrow money from a loan shark who charged a very high interest rate and seized her automated teller machine (ATM) card as loan collateral. The high interest rate further depleted her budget for their everyday needs. That\u2019s why she\u2019s been longing to pay the balance of her debt and eventually recover her ATM card. She\u2019s a member of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative* where she gained the inspiration to save and acquire more skills in budgeting. She is very much looking forward to your help so she can pay her debt, start anew, and save efficiently so she can better help her family.\r\n\r\nAnselma dreams for their children to finish their education as it is their most valued inheritance. With a college degree, they have a better chance to escape poverty. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and work. *The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects.

It stands out for its prickly pear crops and the business activity of its inhabitants.  Most of them still maintain their mother tongue.  In their homes you can hear long and interesting conversations in Mazahua.  Even though the community is small, the vegetation is extensive, and the scenery is very picturesque.  \r\n\r\nElia lives in this community.  She is very friendly, happy, and hard-working.  She is a clear example of the personality of the population.  She has been married to Gustavo for 13 years. He works as an administrative assistant at a school.  Together they have created a family with four children.  Three of the children attend different levels of school.  When she started she sold baby clothes in an itinerant manner.\r\n\r\nShe has 17 years of experience as a merchant. She traveled the streets in her area looking for customers.  However, 11 years ago she found another opportunity for getting income.  She currently buys and sells costume jewelry like earrings and beaded jewelry.  She also sells nail clippers, pins, ribbons, and bows.  She works every day at the municipal market or at the stand that she has in another state in the republic.   \r\n\r\nElia is very grateful for the previous loans that she received because they helped her to build her own house.  Before that she lived with her in-laws.  Also, with the earnings that she got she was able to set up a small tomato and prickly pear garden.  Sometimes she sell these items on the street.  She will use her new loan to buy jewelry like beaded items, pins, bows, earrings, bracelets, and rings.  She will also buy fertilizer for her plants.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Sof\u00eda, who will buy clothes and prickly pears; Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, who will buy baby clothes; and Eulalia, who will buy costume jewelry.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken at Elia's house.

She\u2019s responsible for folding, pressing, packing, and sometimes shipping clothes and garments. As a female worker, it is not easy for her to carry boxes of clothes but due to her patience and hard work, she willingly does it. She is earning a minimum wage just like her husband, Ronald, who is also a factory worker. They are blessed with a child who is in elementary grade. As a young family, they are quite idealistic and always want the best for their child. But at this stage, they are already burdened with the tuition fee for their child\u2019s education. Their combined income usually goes to basic household needs, utilities and rentals. When it\u2019s time for school enrollment, they look for a reasonable loan and financial assistance but they are being lured by usurious lending agencies with very high interest rates. The couple, especially Lalaine, is trying to avoid these loan sharks knowing that these usurious agencies will require her to surrender her ATM card as loan collateral. It is a blessing that she became a member of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative* where she found another option. It is her prayer that you can help her provide for her child\u2019s tuition and avoid the lure of usurious money lenders. \r\n\r\nShe trusts the Lord that her child will finish school through your kind help. For Lalaine and her husband, education is the most valued inheritance that they can give to their child.\r\n\r\nLalaine meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work. *The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment.

In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store that sells fresh, dry, and packaged products directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of 600 PHP a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting an 8000 PHP loan that she will use to buy grocery items such as instant noodles, rice, eggs, coffee, soda and other grocery items. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her and for a good return on her investment. Rhoda hopes to maintain and grow her business so they can have a better life. She prays for good health. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The last of these is the region's principal crop. During harvest time, the inhabitants spend long days in the fields so that the mills or factories can begin to produce sugar, which revives the economy to a surprising extent.\r\n\r\nA group called El Lindero has been set up in the area, whose members and businesses are: Ramona, who sells fish; Vanesa, vegetables; Gregoria, soft drinks; Catalina, groceries; Mar\u00eda, food; Liliana, clothes; and Paulina, who runs a corn mill.\r\n\r\nPaulina is a great woman who devotes herself to caring for her five children, who have given meaning to her days since she was widowed. Pau, as she is known to everyone, speaks mazateco and still preserves its traditions. She decided to invest her savings in the purchase of a corn mill since she used to have to travel for ten minutes on a dirt track to reach the highway to grind a portion of corn.  \r\n   \r\nHer milling service is available Monday to Sunday from 5:00 am, and goes on until 3:00 pm, when she must wash the stones and walls of the machine. However, if more customers arrive with their containers full of grains of corn, Pau is happy to attend them. \"I was used to grinding corn in a palm leaf - that's how we used to be taught, because there was no machine to do it and corn mills were hard to find,\" says Pau, who is now an expert in her trade.\r\n\r\nWith the money she has made and this loan, she will invest in two mill stones and a 500 litre water tank, so that she doesn't have to make a long journey to fetch water from the well every time she washes her equipment.\r\n\r\nPaulina plans to sow corn in the yard outside her house, since she now sells corn paste, too: \"the main thing is not to give up and to face every situation that life presents us with head on.\"\r\n\r\nThe members of El Lindero are grateful for the opportunity for growth given by each of the loans they have received.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Pau is standing in front of Catalina, who is wearing a grey top.

","en":"Raisa is 60 years old, divorced, and has a son. She has a higher education, specializing as a biologist, and during her career she has worked as a biology teacher, for 17 years as an agronomist in a laboratory, and for five years as a chemist protecting nature. For the last 20 years she has farmed, and Raisa's knowledge really helps her in this. She has a cow, a steer, a heifer, and five sheep. Clover for the livestock is sown on 0.62 hectares of land, and on 0.24 hectares there are 230 currant bushes for sale. She sells her livestock live at the local market. Having started this business with 4,000 som (KGS), thanks to Raisa's hard work her activity brings in about 10,000 som (KGS) per month which is the basis for covering the family's food expenses and everyday needs. This money is not enough for a decent life. Raisa's son restores cars, but his earnings are not regular. In order to further develop her business, Raisa has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy a steer for fattening and resale, and potato seeds to sow. Raisa plans to invest the proceeds of the loan in further increasing her business, improving her family's well-being, and also saving up for her son's wedding."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":407.72,"image":{"id":1893384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a steer and potato seeds in order to invest in her business and increase her income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chelpek village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-06-01T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-01T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.8,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3929},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3654},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3761},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3871},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3983},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4100},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4219},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4342},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4469},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4599},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4733},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4340}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.76},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.7},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.98},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.21},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.83},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":132.71,"local_amount":7583,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":7718.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291685},{"amount":65.82,"local_amount":3761,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3827.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500951},{"amount":64.55,"local_amount":3871,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:07:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3939.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.19,"payment_id":711411882},{"amount":65.03,"local_amount":3983,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4053.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.67,"payment_id":730934108},{"amount":63.81,"local_amount":4100,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4173.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.94,"payment_id":752026180}],"funded_date":"2015-06-22T17:43:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":893874,"name":"Raul Alfredo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Ra\u00fal de 54 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su esposa, el se dedica a la venta de frutas y verduras desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, con lo que obtiene de sus ventas logra solventar los gastos de su hogar, el quiere mejorar el lugar donde tiene su negocio que es el que muestra la fotograf\u00eda construyendo las paredes pero como no tiene de suficiente capital est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito a INTEGRAL para la compra de cemento, arena, ladrillos,  hierro y pago de mano de obra y as\u00ed poder tener un mejor lugar para su negocio.","en":"Don Raul is 54 years old and lives in his own home with his wife.

She has a high school education and earns the main income for her family by raising livestock and planting crops, which she began in 1992 with a livestock purchase of 12,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ainur's hard work, she currently has two cows, a horse, and a 0.6 hectare plot of land where she grows potatoes and clover. Her monthly income is 3,700 som (KGS). This amount is nowhere near enough to live on, which is why Ainur made up her mind to expand her business.

La masa de agua y las erupciones de la tierra han dado origen a diferentes islas, la m\u00e1s com\u00fan lleva el mote de \"Cancuncito\". De igual modo, desde lo alto de los cerros se puede observar un paisaje maravilloso.\n    Recientemente all\u00ed se form\u00f3 el grupo Cancuncito integrado por 10 personas responsables, trabajadoras, honestas y unidas. Ellos son: Bulmaro quien vende fertilizantes; Carmen y Ana, abarrotes; Epifania, Honoria, Mar\u00eda y Mar\u00eda L, pescado mojarra; Maricela, cosm\u00e9ticos; Jacobo, helados y paletas y Elena, tortillas y tamales. \n    Para Do\u00f1a Epifania la vida ha sido una gran maestra puesto que ha sabido sacar provecho a su actividad econ\u00f3mica. Ella est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Paulino quien se ha dedicado a la pesca desde que era un ni\u00f1o.

The mass of water and land eruptions have led to the formation of different islands. The most common has the nickname \"Cancuncito\". Similarly, from the top of the hills you can see a wonderful scenery.\r\n\r\nRecently, a group called Cancuncito formed there. It consists of 10 hardworking, honest and united people. The members are: Bulmaro, who sells fertilizers; Carmen and Ana, who sell groceries; Epifania, Honoria, Mar\u00eda y Mar\u00eda L, who sell mojarra fish (tilapia); Maricela who sells cosmetics; Jacobo who sells ice cream and popsicles, and Elena, who sells tortillas and tamales.\r\n\r\nFor Epifania, life has been a great teacher that has allowed her to take advantage of its economic activity. She is married to Paulino who has made a living fishing since he was a child. Epi, as everyone knows her, speaks Mazatec 80% of the time and knows about 20% of Spanish. She is the mother of five children, all adults. She has been selling the fish her husband catches for 26 years. Paulino enters the lake in the evening and returns home at dawn with the day's catch. Then, the two of them clean the fish.\r\n\r\nEpi has traveled the streets of different communities to sell the tilapia. She remembers when she had to walk for two hours on a mountain trail to meet the needs of her customers, because there did not used to be transport access. \"I speak some Spanish; it helps me understand what my clients tell me, to charge them, and give them change,\" she says. For her, not speaking Spanish has been her main challenge.\r\n   \r\nWith her earnings, Epi supports her husband with household and business expenses. The new loan will help her invest in buying rope for weaving, two nets for drag fishing, and a motor. Epi would like her husband and one of his sons to work on rearing the fish after catching them, to make more revenue.\r\n\r\nThe group is grateful for the opportunity of the loan.

Juntos han formado una familia con seis hijos de los cuales dos de ellos aun dependen de dicha pareja y uno de ellos cursa la primaria.\n   Celia tiene diez a\u00f1os dedic\u00e1ndose a la compra y venta de art\u00edculos de fantas\u00eda, inici\u00f3 su negocio porque quer\u00eda ayudar con los gastos de su hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. Para Do\u00f1a Celia este tipo de productos es muy f\u00e1cil de vender adem\u00e1s de que es capaz de obtener el doble de sus ganancias y le ayuda mucho el hecho de que no son art\u00edculos perecederos. \"No son como los alimentos que se echan a perder y se pierden la inversi\u00f3n y las ganancias\". A pesar de que al principio ten\u00eda muy poca mercanc\u00eda poco a poco el negocio fue creciendo. Los puntos de venta de Celia son los tianguis, las plazas y mercados de la regi\u00f3n, lugares en los que acomoda los productos tres veces a la semana. Las temporadas de lluvia son las que representan mayor dificultad para Celia ya que las ventas suelen disminuir. Con el nuevo pr\u00e9stamo podr\u00e1 comprar bolitas, aretes, pulseras y mo\u00f1os para el cabello; productos indispensables en todo negocio de bisuter\u00eda. \"Acostumbro a comprar mucho para que me den buenos precios y as\u00ed obtengo mejores ganancias\".\n   La meta de Celia es poder continuar con su negocio para seguir apoyando econ\u00f3micamente a su esposo y a la educaci\u00f3n de su hijo, pero sobre todo mejorar su vivienda. \n   Los dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Mar\u00eda Isabel quien invertir\u00e1 en su carpinter\u00eda, Juana en productos de fantas\u00eda y Eva en su tienda de abarrotes.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en la tienda de abarrotes de Do\u00f1a Eva.

It also stands out because of its hills which are covered in large leafy trees and full of life.  The majority of its inhabitants work by growing prickly pears and corn, high value products that are the basis of their diet.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Celia is a very sociable and cheerful person who has been married to se\u00f1or Ferm\u00edn for 27 years. Together they have produced a family of six children, two of which two still depend on them, with one attending elementary school. \r\n\r\nCelia has spent ten years working in the buying and selling of imitation jewellery.  She started her business because she wanted to help with household costs and the education of her children. For Do\u00f1a Celia these types of products are very easy to sell and they also give her the opportunity to double her earnings.  It helps a lot that they are not perishable goods. \"They are not like food products which go off and on which you lose your investment and income.\" \r\n\r\nDespite having only a few products at the start, little by little the business grew. Celia sells her products from street markets, squares and regional markets; places where she displays her products three times a week. The wet seasons are when Celia experiences most difficulty as her sales tend to drop. With this new loan she will be able to buy beads, earrings, bracelets and hair ribbons; indispensable products for every imitation jewellery business. \"I am used to buying a lot in order to get good prices and therefore have more earnings.\"\r\n\r\nCelia's goal is to be able to continue the business in order to continue supporting her husband and her child's education.

She is married with 2 children aged between 1 and 3 years, who are too young for school. She is a farmer and she has been growing maize for the past 7 years. Also her husband is a farmer. With the loan from Kiva, she would like to pay workers who harvested maize. The profits from the business will be used to increase her welfare and to pay school fees in the future for her children.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

El nombre se debe al gusto que las integrantes comparten por la libertad y la belleza de estos peque\u00f1os seres. Cabe hacer menci\u00f3n que \u201cLa Bestia\u201d se utiliza como servicio de carga, trasportando grano o az\u00facar pues la zona es totalmente productora de ca\u00f1a.\n   Los integrantes del grupo y sus actividades son: Rafaela quien vende cerdos; Noem\u00ed, abarrotes; Cintia, recipientes de pl\u00e1stico; Ana Bertha, mojarra; Mario, refacciones de motocicletas; Nancy, calzado por cat\u00e1logo y tortillas hechas a mano y Alicia, joyer\u00eda. Por su lado, Salvador maneja un restaurante y Abel realiza decoraciones. \n   El mayor sue\u00f1o de Mario siempre hab\u00eda sido tener su propio negocio y no depender de nadie; para poder lograrlo trabaj\u00f3 arduamente. Vend\u00eda tortillas de lunes a domingo desde las 5 de la ma\u00f1ana y hasta las 2 de la tarde, as\u00ed, con las ganancias obtenidas y los pr\u00e9stamos otorgados, pudo iniciar con la venta de refacciones para motocicleta. Al inicio vend\u00eda en casa y cuando \u00e9l no estaba su esposa atend\u00eda a los clientes, exhib\u00eda la mercanc\u00eda en una peque\u00f1a vitrina y colgaba las llantas en un tubo colocado en el techo del corredor de su casa.\n   Hace cuatro meses Mario abri\u00f3 su propia refaccionaria en la calle principal del municipio. Su clientela aument\u00f3 gracias a los precios accesibles y a su amplio surtido, su lema es \u201cal cliente lo que pida, si no lo tengo lo consigo y a mejor precio\u201d. Con las ganancias obtenidas solventa los gastos de su hogar, cubre los pagos de la renta y aumenta la variedad de accesorios para satisfacer los gustos de sus clientes.\n   Mario espera lograr una estabilidad en su actividad para despu\u00e9s abrir una segunda refaccionaria la cual ser\u00e1 atendida por Maricela, su esposa. Esta vez el pr\u00e9stamo lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de espejos, baleros, balatas, aceite, buj\u00edas y c\u00e1maras para los neum\u00e1ticos.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada frente a las v\u00edas por donde \u201cLa Bestia\u201d hace su recorrido, Mario viste playera blanca y una gorra. La ni\u00f1a que viste short blanco es hija de do\u00f1a Rafaela que viste pantal\u00f3n blanco.

It should be mentioned that 'The Beast' is used as a cargo service to transport grain or sugar as the area produces only sugar cane.\r\n\r\nThe group members and their jobs are: Rafaela, who sells pigs; Noem\u00ed, groceries; Cintia, plastic containers; Ana Bertha, knives; Mario, motorbike parts; Nancy, footwear from a catalogue and homemade tortillas and Alicia, jewellery. For his part Salvador manages a restaurant and Abel makes decorations. \r\n\r\nMario's greatest wish has always been to have his own store and not depend on anyone; to achieve this he has worked arduously. He sold tortillas from Monday to Sunday from 5 in the morning until 2 in the afternoon and with the earnings he made and the loans he was granted he was able to begin selling motorbike parts. At the beginning he sold them from home and when he wasn't in his wife served the customers. He displayed his merchandise in a small glass cabinet and hung the tyres from a pipe on the ceiling of the corridor in his house.\r\n\r\nFour months ago Mario opened his own repair store in the main street of the municipality. His clientele has expanded thanks to his accessible prices and his wide range of stock. His motto is \"if the client asks for it, they get it; if I don't have it I will get it and at a better price\". With the income he has made he can pay the household bills, cover the rent and increase his variety of accessories to satisfy his customers' tastes. \r\n \r\nMario hopes to achieve financial stability with this job so that he can open a second repairs store where Maricela, his wife, will work. This loan will be used to buy mirrors, ball bearings, brake pads, oil, spark plugs and tyre chambers. \r\n\r\n*This photo was taken in front of the train tracks where 'The Beast' runs. Mario is wearing a white t-shirt and a cap.  The girl who is wearing white shorts is the daughter of Rafaela who is wearing white pants. The girl in the checked shorts is the daughter of Noem\u00ed who is wearing a green blouse.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6300,"image":{"id":1888577,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy mirrors, ball bearings, brake pads, oil, spark plugs and tyre chambers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tetela,Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-06-01T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-01T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":6300,"lender_count":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rafaela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noemi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salvador ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cintia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Bertha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mario ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":96000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9600},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9600},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9600},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9600},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":9600},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":9600},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":9600},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":9600},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9600},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":9600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":630},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":630},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":630},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":630},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":630},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":630},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":630},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":630},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":630},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":630}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1890,"local_amount":28800,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:21:33Z","rounded_local_amount":28842.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682141104},{"amount":1890,"local_amount":28800,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":28842.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768238},{"amount":1260,"local_amount":19200,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":19228.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701288},{"amount":1260,"local_amount":19200,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":19228.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204380}],"funded_date":"2015-06-10T22:28:08Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T17:57:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Grasso","image":357930}},{"id":894042,"name":"Jacinta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacinta joined Hand in Hand Eastern Africa in the year 2014 to benefit from training on enterprise management and financial management.

It is her prayer that you can help her provide for her children\u2019s tuition and avoid the lure of usurious money lenders. \r\n\r\nFor Filipino families like Wilma\u2019s, education is the most valued inheritance that they can give to their children. She trusts the Lord that their children will finish education through your kind help. Wilma is also praying to own a house for the whole family someday.\r\n\r\nWilma meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n*The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services. \r\n\r\n**CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before they start their daily work routines. Bible readings, prayer devotions, and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1892972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for her children's tuition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Carmona, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-01T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-01T23:20:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2980.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314480},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523177},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433606},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954538},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.3,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044500}],"funded_date":"2015-06-02T01:40:12Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":891530,"name":"Yolmi Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yolmy es una bella mujer de 20 a\u00f1os de edad, soltera, criada con unas muy buenas costumbres, desde el colegio desarrollo una gran pasi\u00f3n y gusto por todo lo relacionado con la belleza.  \n\nInicio su etapa productiva realizando cursos y capacitaciones, hasta que un d\u00eda se aventur\u00f3 y decidi\u00f3 ir en busca de su propia clientela montando un negocio de sal\u00f3n de belleza y relajaci\u00f3n en su hogar. \n\nSolicita un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de equipo electrocurador, alta frecuencia, vaporizador, faja t\u00e9rmica y surtido pues tambi\u00e9n quiere vender productos para complementar sus servicios, como crema de manos, gel, productos capilares, tinturas para cabello, barnices.\n\nEl cr\u00e9dito para ella ser\u00e1 muy importante pues terminara de consolidar su empresa complet\u00e1ndola con todos los insumos necesarios para operar y ofrecer cualquier servicio que lleguen a solicitarle.\n\nSu sue\u00f1o es que su empresa progrese de la mano de Interactuar y tenga muchos clientes.  \n\n","en":"Yolmy is a beautiful 20 year old woman.
