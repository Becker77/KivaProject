She is a 29-year-old married woman with four dependents. Her oldest child is 11 and the youngest is two. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy supplies like tuba (coconut) wine and frozen goods. The loan will help Melaflor purchase more tuba and a variety of frozen goods to be sold. This will enable her to provide more stocks to her respective customers, and to encourage them to purchase. Thus, her income will increase and she will be better able to handle her finances.

She is married to Juddy, a welder. The couple works hard to  provide for their daily personal household needs. \r\n\r\nFlora operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of Php 700 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as sacks of rice, instant noodles, chips, coffee soda and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her and good return on her investment for it will surely cover their daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nFlora hopes grow her business and have a bigger store someday. She hopes that God will bless them with a peaceful and abundant life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1893087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items, beverages, and toiletries to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-01T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-01T23:30:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120,"local_amount":5333.36,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5365.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314481},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2682.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523178},{"amount":45,"local_amount":1999.96,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2012.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433607}],"funded_date":"2015-06-02T00:44:48Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":891574,"name":"Aurelia Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Aurelia, en su humilde hogar, intenta ganarse la vida con la venta de golosinas, dulces, obleas, entre otros.

His basic responsibility is sewing clothes and maintaining the sewing machines. He\u2019s married to Alma, also a sewer, and they are blessed with two children. The couple\u2019s combined minimum wage cannot usually suffice to meet their growing financial needs, especially since they are paying a monthly amortization for their house. They were able to acquire a low-cost housing unit in high hopes of having their own house. Even if the house is bare, which means it badly needs improvement and furnishings, they manage to live in it. \r\n\r\nDue to their growing basic family needs, house repair and improvement lag behind other priorities. Much as they want to improve it, they don\u2019t want to snatch the budget from their basic needs and children\u2019s education. Also, they no longer want to be enslaved to usurious money-lenders who charge very high interest rates and retain their automated teller machine (ATM) card as loan collateral. It is a blessing that Tirso became a member of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative* where he got the information that there are other options for taking a loan. With your kind help he can now have the opportunity to improve their house, a home to their happy family.  \r\n\r\nTirso dreams for their children to finish their education, as it is their most valued inheritance. With a college degree, they have a better chance of lifting themselves from poverty. He meets up with his co-fellowship** members to share stories of his life and work. \r\n\r\n*The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment.

As a member of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*, she won\u2019t have any problem in repaying the loan because it will be deducted from her salary every payday.\r\n \r\nIt is Editha's dream that through such a business, her family will have additional income for their children\u2019s higher education needs. For Editha and her husband, education is the most valued legacy that they can give to their children. She trusts in the Lord that their children will finish education through your kind help. \r\n\r\nEditha meets up regularly with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n*The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services. \r\n\r\n**CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before they start their daily work routines. Bible readings, prayer devotions, and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1892976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Water Distribution","sector":"Services","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to have starting capital for mineral or purified water distribution","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Binan, Laguna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-02T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-02T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Editha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2980.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314482},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523179},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433608},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954539},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.3,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044501}],"funded_date":"2015-06-02T16:02:59Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":891575,"name":"Luis Angel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis, de 36 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 en un negocio de construcci\u00f3n y reformas de viviendas en el municipio de El Carmen De Viboral, negocio que empez\u00f3 el af\u00e1n de sostener a su hija y ofrecerles una mejor calidad de vida.\n\nEn el momento en que naci\u00f3 su hija, encontr\u00f3 su motivaci\u00f3n para trabajar incansablemente y as\u00ed ofrecerle lo mejor para su vida y desarrollo.\n\nHoy en d\u00eda se han convertido en la alegr\u00eda de este hombre trabajador.\n\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de herramientas de construcci\u00f3n para iniciar con una obra.\n\nCon este pr\u00e9stamo podr\u00e1 sostener a su hija y a su esposa brind\u00e1ndoles una mejor oportunidad de progreso a trav\u00e9s de su trabajo.\n\nApoya a Luis con un pr\u00e9stamo para que pueda continuar con su actividad!\n\n\n","en":"Luis is 36 years old and has a construction and home remodeling business in the municipality of El Carmen De Viboral.

Ishrat's husband wants to purchase different kinds of commodities e.g, rice, sugar, tea bags, milk and other consumer items for his business purpose. But due to financial constraints her husband is not in a suitable position to buy all  these products for reselling purposes. \r\n\r\nTherefore Ishrat has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her husband to buy all these commodities and will also help him to earn a maximum profitable income to manage his household and business.

They live in a community that produces sugar cane and employs more than 2000 labourers at harvest time.  \r\n\r\nThe group members are: Maura, who sells serviettes; Roberta, fruit and vegetables; Alma, lollies; Sabina, clothes; Elena, lollies; \u00c1ngel, lollies and Imelda, bags and wallets. \r\n\r\n\u00c1ngel is a very hardworking young man. He recently married and in three months he will become the father of a little one. Two months ago he decided to work as a builder's assistant but now he wants to give his family the best so that is why, together with his wife, he began selling lollies and snacks. On the weekend he assembles two tables: one for sweets and the other for snacks such as crackling which he prepares with mayonnaise, chicken, ham, cheese, light cream, tomato, avocado and salsa. The snacks his customers eat most are chips, icy poles, fruity flavoured ice cream, soft drinks and seasonal fruit. Mario is able to sell up to 80 ice creams and 40 icy poles in a day. \r\n\r\nThe previous loans he was granted have been useful as he has invested them in other areas such as tortillas and now lollies. \u201cThe profits I have made and the amount I saved from my salary will go towards my wife's birth. I always try to give my family the best\" are the words of \u00c1ngel, who was overcome with emotion. This new loan will be used to buy snacks, chewing gum, icy poles and lollies since his main customers are kids from the neighbourhood who are happy to come and see his table filled with products.  \r\n\r\n*This photo was taken in \u00c1ngel's house where they put all the lollies on the table. He is the only man in the group.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1888574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy chips, chewing gum, icy poles and lollies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acatlan de Perez, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-06-02T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-02T01:50:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angel Maddiel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":315,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:21:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4807.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682141105},{"amount":315,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4807.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768239},{"amount":210,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3204.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701289},{"amount":210,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3204.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204381}],"funded_date":"2015-06-07T14:43:10Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T17:57:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Grasso","image":357930}},{"id":894055,"name":"Hudoydod","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hudoydod is a bright guy.

For a year now, he supervises some sewers, monitors the production of sample clothing and updates the inventory record.\r\n\r\nJust recently he got married to Maricel, and their first child is on the way. He is quite excited for the arrival of their firstborn and he is preparing for his wife's delivery. Although he already has some savings but he still needs huge amount. As a single person before, he has this loving attitude of giving a large portion of his salary to his parents to help in their everyday needs. Only a meager portion was being left for his allowance and savings. This is very normal for Filipino families who are known to be so closely knit.\r\n\r\nJupiter consulted his co-fellowship members at CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative* regarding his impending need for his wife\u2019s delivery. He was advised to avoid the usurious money-lending agencies that proliferate in their community and he was offered another option through Kiva. The entire cooperative is praying for your help and for the safe delivery of their child.\r\n\r\n*The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services. **CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before they start their daily work routines. Bible readings, prayer devotions, and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1892927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for his wife's delivery of their first child","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Carmona, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-02T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-02T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jupiter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2980.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314485},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523182},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433611},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954542},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.3,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1490.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044504}],"funded_date":"2015-06-02T05:44:06Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jim Brule","image":840348}},{"id":894070,"name":"Celso","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celso is 37 years old and is from Trinidad, Bohol.

The main seedlings planted are broccoli, cabbage, lettuce, and cauliflower.\r\n\r\nFederico wants to buy seeds in order to use the whole capacity of the greenhouse and meet the demand for seedlings in the region, considering that the productive process of the horticulture farms begins during the coming months with the start of the rainy season. \r\n\r\nFor seedling production, Federico uses an eco-friendly process using organic fertilizers such as bokashi, a compost made out of fermented organic matter. He says that his objective is to achieve sustainable management of the ecosystems in order to interrelate the conservation of natural resources with better production levels.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Federico and his wife will be able to generate employment in the region, sell seedlings to local producers and increase their family earnings to improve their living conditions.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1934.64,"image":{"id":1891695,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy seeds to produce and sell vegetable seedlings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Chamula, Chiapas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":368,"posted_date":"2015-06-02T02:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-02T02:10:04Z","loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Federico","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":40264,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":7584.16},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":9019.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":7266.53},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5524.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5673.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5195.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":499.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":593.63},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":478.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":363.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":373.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":499.16,"local_amount":7584.16,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-18T12:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":7631.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696553909},{"amount":593.63,"local_amount":9019.6,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-18T12:15:46Z","rounded_local_amount":9075.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468073},{"amount":478.25,"local_amount":7266.53,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":7311.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730987953},{"amount":363.6,"local_amount":5524.58,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:02:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5559.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076365}],"funded_date":"2015-06-17T18:07:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":894071,"name":"Zubida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zubida has successfully built her business selling cloth with the support of Kashf Foundation and Kiva.

She is married to Dante, a construction worker. She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal, household needs.\r\n\r\nVilma operates a small variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also makes peanut butter to sell at her small store by her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of Php 800 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items and pay for the ingredients of peanut butter she sells at a retail price. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her for it will surely help cover their daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nVilma hopes to expand her retail business.  She prays for God to bless them with an abundant and peaceful life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance

All of them are responsible, hard working, honest people who give their all every day for their families. The group is made up of Imelda, who sells food; Georgina, groceries; Abelina, shoes; Silvestra, traditional glasses; Rosa, shoes; Lucelly, clothing and groceries; Yesenia, cosmetics and soft drinks; Yolzyn, shoes and groceries; V\u00edctor, jewellery and Mariano, who runs a sewing workshop.\r\n\r\nGeorgina has been married to Roque for 10 years. Two of her three daughters have made her a grandma which she is very happy about. Geo, as everyone knows her by, began a small grocery store where she just displayed her merchandise on a table. As time passed and helped by her earnings she modified her space and introduced lollies, soft drinks, snacks and vegetables. These days she occupies a shed where she displays her merchandise on metal and plastic shelves. In spite of the competition, Geo has been able to get ahead thanks to her customers who seek out her accessible prices, extensive range and friendly service. \u201cThe growth of a business should be slow, precise and concise\", she remarked with certainty.\r\n\r\nHaving a store in her own home makes Geo feel safe. After 7pm she only makes sales through a window in the door. She uses part of her earnings to help her husband with the bills and her daughters with milk and nappies for the babies.\r\n \r\nOn this occasion she will use her loan to buy milk, sugar, biscuits, rice, soup, beans, corn, oil, cheese, ham, sausages, chips, soft drink and disposable plates and glasses. Geo is also thinking of replacing the dirt floor of her house with a firm cement floor.\r\nThe Guadalupe Victoria group give thanks for the loans that they have been granted because they have increased the profits they have made in their jobs. \r\n\r\n*This photograph was taken in Geo's store. She is the only one who is wearing glasses. The children in the photo appear with their respective mothers.

These days, she has been offering products of excellent quality for two years: breads of different types, puddings for special occasions, and snacks, which are distributed from her residence in the south of Barranguilla, where her neighbors and passersby through the sector find themselves tempted to enjoy the delicious confectionary products which she in the company of her husband make, though the principal customers are the shops in the nearby neighborhoods.\r\nNow she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing request she makes through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, which she will invest in the purchase of raw materials such as flour, butter, lard, eggs, snacks, caramel, yeast, and more.  This investment will allow her to increase the assortment in her business and be able to meet the demand. \r\nShe is the mother of two daughters to whom she wishes to offer a better quality of life and because of this she wishes to have her own house in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":136.01,"image":{"id":1890013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to buy raw materials such as flour, butter, lard, eggs, snacks, caramel, yeast, and more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-06-02T02:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-02T02:50:08Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.3,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edilse Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":550000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":64923},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":64187},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":65953},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":67766},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":69630},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":71545},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":73512},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":72484}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.72},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.07},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.56,"local_amount":64923,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":66863.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681350615},{"amount":24.38,"local_amount":64187,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":66105.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.88,"payment_id":696560873},{"amount":24.69,"local_amount":65953,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":67924,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.29,"payment_id":711475600},{"amount":26.43,"local_amount":67766,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:25:37Z","rounded_local_amount":69791.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.29,"payment_id":730994463},{"amount":25.65,"local_amount":69630,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":71710.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.84,"payment_id":752082428}],"funded_date":"2015-06-03T00:26:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Livingston Sutro","image":null}},{"id":891610,"name":"Doris Barbara","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Grupo De Cr\u00e9dito Las Palmas se re\u00fane cada 15 d\u00edas en la ciudad de Manta,  ciudad conocida por sus hermosas playas que son muy visitadas en toda \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o, por su gastronom\u00eda y por ser una ciudad con una belleza sin igual con muchos atractivos tur\u00edsticos.\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Doris, tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen tres hijos de 16, 14 y 13 a\u00f1os que estudian en colegio.

My parents never had any formal employment and on a small plot of land they practiced farming, which barely supported  the family. I was schooled in local primary and secondary schools. Despite the limited resources and fees problems, I persisted and completed school.\r\n \r\nThe audacity to have an impactful future has led me to seek a Kiva loan to study at Strathmore University. I have therefore enrolled to start in June 2015, working on a Bachelor of Business and Information Technology degree.\r\n\r\nI aspire to make positive contributions to the society I live in. I am already a member of a local football club and I will engage in co-curricular activities actively at  Strathmore University. I believe in volunteer work since it is fulfilling to care for humanity.\r\n \r\nI believe in an empowered society. That is why I have a profound desire to study at Strathmore University. Not only to pass in academic units, but to be transformed, gaining in ethical, moral and dignified leadership. I possess immense potential and I am seeking this loan to keep me in school, to enable me tap into wisdom and to develop the expertise needed to be competitive not only in the job market but also in entrepreneurship and care for humanity. I have a dream to be a successful entrepreneur, creating jobs and inspiring young

Thanks to both the loan amount and to her tireless effort and endurance, she receives a monthly income of about 15,000 KGS from her agricultural work and the sale of organic milk. She currently has three cows on her farm as well as 2.0 hectares of land where she grows clover. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of increasing her head count of livestock, Gulash has approached Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 KGS, a portion of which will go toward land cultivation. She plans to use profits from the loan to further develop her business and also to acquire household appliances that will help her very much with the farm. She will also put money toward preparing her favourite grandchild for school.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

In the past, she managed to buy a cow with money that she saved.  In the future, she would like to do this again, and also buy a cart to give her children a better future in agriculture.  This is why she has requested a loan from the field partner, RMCR, to buy sheep and goats to raise and sell on.  Fatoumata buys and sells her animals at a local market.  Her profits, which average 5,000 francs CFA a month, will pay for healthcare, food and clothing for her children.\r\n\r\nFatoumata would like to continue in livestock raising so she can meet her needs

A sari-sari (variety) store sells different kinds of products, such as biscuits, candies, canned goods, noodles, personal hygiene products, and the like, which are involved in every individual\u2019s daily living. This is one of the most common businesses built by ordinary people since it provides commodities for people. \r\n\r\nWith this fact, Susana was enticed to get in touch with this kind of craft. She is 45 years old, is married to Mario, a security guard, and is a resident of Batasan, Quezon City, Philippines. They work with determination to pursue the needs of their family. The income they get from the store helps them with their daily expenditures. \r\n\r\nHowever, the profits they get from the business are sometimes insufficient. It is because at times she finds it hard to maintain supplies of various products due to financial incapability. This is why she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan that she will utilize to buy additional merchandise for her inventory. With more products displayed in her store, she can increase her income. \r\n\r\nIn due time, she hopes that she will progress and that her business will increase sales. Through this, she can earn and save money for another place where they can build her own branch someday, if God allows. She is very thankful and she prays for more blessings to come. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group comprises 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1031.26,"image":{"id":1893206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The members of the group and their business activities are Leoba, who sells napkins and vegetables; Pascual, who sells candy; Liliana, who sells food; Margarita, who sells tortillas; Antonia, who sells clothes; Deysi, who sells gold and silver items; Senobia, who sells cosmetics; Mar\u00eda Salome, who sells typical food; Eva, who sells clothes and food; B\u00e1rbara, who sells shoes by catalog; Elvia, who sells costume jewelry, containers, and food; Lizbeth, who sells by catalog; and Joel, who provides maintenance to computer equipment.\r\n\r\nJoel lives with his parents, and he is single.  He has a lot of goals in his life.  From Monday to Friday he works at an elementary school in a nearby community.  He is in charge of the administration of the school.  The enjoyment that he gets from technology and the desire to improve himself led him to work in his business, which is repairing and maintaining computer equipment.  He remembers that eight years ago he repaired the first computer. \u201cThe machine was a lost cause.  They had told my customer that it would no longer work, and I fixed it.  From then on I fix between two to five computers a month\u201d.\r\n\r\nHe has noticed progressive advancement in his business activity.  Thanks to his earnings, he will start selling items for computers.  He will use the loan to buy USB devices, fans, speakers, screen wipes, and screen protectors.  These are the items that are most requested by some of his customers.\r\n\r\nWith the profits that he gets and with his salary he supports his parents with the household expenses, pays for his personal expenses, and buys the tools needed to continue working.\r\n\r\nJoel is eternally grateful for the opportunity of the loan just as the whole group is.  His business activity increases, and some of the members have started new business activities.\r\n\r\n*The photo was taken on Leoba\u2019s patio.  She is showing the items that she embroiders.  Joel is the only man in the group.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6750,"image":{"id":1888608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She decided to pursue new opportunities to improve her quality of life, through a business which she could run out of her home so she would not neglect her family.

Thanks to the countless specialty catalogs available that offer personal products of high quality at affordable prices, Mabel managed to launch her business. For the past year, she has worked Monday through Sunday promoting the catalogs to neighbors and acquaintances selling products, which are cash sales.

The local lake is an important tourist attraction and for this reason it is a great source of employment for the locals who have established food businesses on its banks. The main dishes are prepared with 'mojarra', a type of sea bream which is typical of the region. \r\n\r\nThe J\u00fapiter group comes from this community and is composed of 8 members whose names and professions are: Norma who sells clothes; Gaudencia, cosmetics; Brigida, tablecloths, napkins and clothes; Ofelia and Simona, fish; Esperanza, soft-drinks; Petra, cosmetics and Cecilia who makes a living dressmaking.\r\n\r\nCecilia is an enterprising woman who is committed to her family. She is married to Demitrio and they have four children together, the two youngest are still in school. Cecilia has been sewing ever since the age of eight. In the beginning she did all of her needlework by hand and used a needle and thread only. She says \u201cone day my parents went off out to the field. I went into the wardrobe and took out a new flowery sheet; I cut the fabric and hurried myself to sew it back together again. When my parents returned I hid, and upon hearing my mother\u2019s reaction when she saw what I did, I didn\u2019t want to come out again\u201d. Cecilia smiles as she remembers those years in which she was so curious. Thereafter, she was in charge of making clothes for her sisters and later she got her first sewing machine, an important tool for her business.\r\n\r\nToday, Celia is a certified seamstress who even teaches workshops at an institute in the town. With her earnings she has managed to buy eight more machines, two of which are industrial ones. \u201cMy greatest desire to is to purchase two embroidery machines and to hire some people from the local community\u201d. The loan will be invested in cloth, thread, buttons and needles because they have been asked to make a large quantity of uniforms for the school closures that are coming up.\r\n \r\nCecilia is

through the auspices of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nAdelaida does the sewing and designing of clothing apparel according to the company or the client\u2019s demand. She sews clothes using a sewing machine or other stitching machines, or often does hand stitching of edges and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Adelaida, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses, and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Adelaida is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying since the loan payment is being deducted every payday.  Adelaida looks forward for your positive response and any coming amount from you will surely be of great help. She will also use the loan to pay for their housing expense.\r\n\r\nAdelaida hopes to improve their present financial condition. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1893249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay for their housing expense.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-02T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-02T15:30:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adelaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2971.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314500},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1485.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523195},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1485.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433624},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1485.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954555},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.3,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1485.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044516}],"funded_date":"2015-06-05T20:53:04Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":894201,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn works hard to support her family.

He already has two children and is married to Desire, who is also a factory worker. They are both beneficiaries of the employment services under the supervision of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nVicente works as a clothing presser.  He presses fabrics or garments during the production process (known as under-pressing), as well in the final stages of production (usually in a garment-finishing department).\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Vicente, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Vicente is asking for your assistance to prevent him from being exposed to any loan sharks. He has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and he had no problem in returning it back since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day.  He looks forward for your positive response and any help from you will surely be of great help. He will use the loan to redeem their rights for their forfeited house.\r\n\r\nVicente dreams to improve their present living condition. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1893262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To redeem their rights for their forfeited house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Carmona, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-02T15:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-02T15:40:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicente","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2971.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314502},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1485.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523197},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1485.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433626},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1485.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954557},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.3,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1485.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044518}],"funded_date":"2015-06-04T09:43:27Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":894214,"name":"Glorious","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Glorious owns s a retail shop that sells general merchandise and she lives in Hoima, Uganda.

Because of your previous support, Marian has already redeemed her ATM card and was able to pay for the educational expenses of their children. She's very appreciative and wishes you more blessings!\r\n\r\nThis time, she's seeking your help once again as she's longing to repair their house that is already wearing away. They can now provide for their basic needs such as food, utilities and education. However, house repair and improvement lag behind other priorities. With a lot of typhoons that swept the Philippines, their house has been deteriorating. Much as they want to restore and improve it, they don\u2019t want to snatch the budget for their basic needs and children\u2019s education.

He works there as Packer who prepares the finished products for shipping or delivery. Sometimes he does the repacking in case there are mistakes in terms of quantity and quality of packaging.\r\n\r\nJust recently he got married to Myra, and their first child is on the way. He is quite excited at the arrival of their firstborn and he is preparing for his wife's delivery. Although he already has some savings, he still needs huge amount. As a single person before, he has this loving attitude of giving a large portion of his salary to his parents to help in their everyday needs. Only a meager portion was being left for his allowance and savings. This is very usual for Filipino families who are known to be so closely knit. Teddy consulted his co-fellowship** members at CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative* regarding his impending needs for his wife\u2019s delivery. He was advised to avoid those usurious money-lending agencies that proliferate in their community and he was offered another option through YOU. The entire cooperative is praying for your help and for the safe delivery of their child.\r\n\r\nTeddy dreams of running a business someday and he is quite positive that it will help his family experience a more abundant life. When that time comes, he would be happy to help other people in need. \r\n\r\n*The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services. **CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before they start their daily work routines. Bible readings, prayer devotions, and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1893237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical Expenses","sector":"Health","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for his wife's delivery of their child.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Carmona, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-02T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-02T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.68,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4085.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314504},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2042.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523199},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2042.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433628},{"amount":45.82,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2042.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954559},{"amount":45.82,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2042.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044520}],"funded_date":"2015-06-02T21:25:53Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":894195,"name":"Bernadette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bernadette works hard to support her family.

Cavite through the auspices of the Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative (CCT). She does the sewing and stitching of different apparels according to the company or client\u2019s dictates. She uses a sewing machine and other stitching machines as well as handstitching hems and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Maridel is meeting family expenses without access to savings or credit. Workers can become heavily indebted to money lenders who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Maridel would like to ask for your assistance to help her circumvent loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem in repaying them since the loan payments were automatically deducted from her paycheck. She is seeking an 8,000 PHP loan to pay for roof installation cost of their house.\r\n\r\nShe looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. Maridel hopes that her child will finish her education with flying colors.\r\n\r\nCCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force and equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\nCCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and after-work hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1893239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for the roof installation cost of their house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Laguna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-02T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-02T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maridel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2971.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314499},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1485.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523194},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1485.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433623},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1485.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954554},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.3,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1485.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044515}],"funded_date":"2015-06-03T02:45:33Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Devashini Satiananden","image":401253}},{"id":894197,"name":"Ederlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ederlinda is married with two children.

For the 7 years she has lived in this community she has worked making and selling hammocks, cots and chairs with thread. \"I learned how to weave the hammocks in prison along with the prisoners and I also learned how to weave the cots and chairs\" she comments with enthusiasm. Virginia visited a family member in prison and took advantage of the time to learn from the prisoners and teach others what she knows. <br \/><br \/>To make the products she buys thread in great quantities that she buys in Chiapas at a good price given that the distributors know her s she is a native of this state.

She opened the grocery with her savings and it is now her means of supporting herself.  \"I work at the store, earn my own way and don't depend on anyone else for my living\", she says.  The business is a sort of therapy, she adds, because there are always people around and she is never lonely.  She opens the store at 5:00am because her customers often come very early to buy from her.  She stocks her merchandise on metal shelves and her customers tell her what they want.  Her income from the business covers her expenses.\r\nDo\u00f1a Irma has reinvested part of her earnings to stock her business with beans, rice, sugar, eggs, cooking oil, cheese, coffee and snacks because those are the products that her customers most want.  She will use her share of the loan to add new products so that her customers have a wider range of goods to buy: chiles, jitomates, onions, garlic, and toilet paper, for example.

He is majoring in economics at the university.  He is intelligent, patient, a good listener, caring, friendly, and a very hard worker.  <br \/><br \/>He is studying at a public university in the central zone, an area where the streets intersect and that has a very complicated traffic pattern, and in the middle of which is the municipal library.  Businesses operate 24 hours a day, which means the place is always bustling and offers a wide range of options:  cafes, restaurants, museums, etc.  It has a cold and dry climate with a daytime temperature of between 0 and 15 degrees Celsius (between 32 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit).<br \/><br \/>Luis has a dark complexion and brown eyes, eyeglasses, short black hair, a short stature, and a thin physique.  His mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1, which he speaks with his family.  Otherwise he speaks Spanish in general and in his studies.  <br \/><br \/>He spends his life working and studying.  He lives in a rental house which is brick with a corrugated iron roof and a wood floor.  It has running water, electricity, gas, and plumbing.<br \/><br \/>Luis has worked as a microcredit officer at a bank for 4 years, and he is in his 3rd of a 5-year economics degree.  \"I am finishing my studies, and this requires me to pay for the seminars,\" he says.<br \/><br \/>The advantage of his activities is that the schedules do not coincide.  The disadvantage is the lack of economic support to pay for his final academic requirements.  His dream is to finish his degree so that he can get a better job.  He wants to pay for the refresher seminar on accounting and financial regulations.  This is the second round of loans with the institution in the 4 years that he has worked in the financial sector.<br \/><br \/>These are the reasons why Luis is applying for a loan to pay for his final refresher seminars on accounting regulations and to get a better job."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":192.37,"image":{"id":1890689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

federal el mes de mayo es sin\u00f3nimo de fiesta y alegr\u00eda pues celebran  al santo patrono de la regi\u00f3n. Los habitantes de la localidad y de los lugares aleda\u00f1os se dan cita para participar en los eventos culturales programados. Las calles se visten de colores y la m\u00fasica es reflejo del gran ambiente que se vive. \n   En dicha comunidad se form\u00f3 un grupo integrado por cinco mujeres  trabajadoras quienes decidieron llamarse Las Fresitas haciendo referencia a que su grupo es exclusivo. Ellas son: Emma y Brenda quienes venden tacos; Mar\u00eda, comida,  ropa y art\u00edculos de oro laminado; Celia y Liliana, antojitos t\u00edpicos. \n   Brenda es una joven madre de cuatro hijos, uno de ellos tiene un problema con sus piernas por lo que acude a terapia con regularidad. Ella forma parte de una familia dedicada a la venta de tacos; as\u00ed surgi\u00f3 el amor que tiene por esta actividad y desde hace catorce a\u00f1os tiene su propia taquer\u00eda.

The people of the town and the surrounding areas gather to participate in the cultural events that occur. The streets are filled with colors and the music reflects the great atmosphere that prevails.\r\n\r\nIn this community, a group of five working women formed. They decided to call themselves \u201cLas Fresitas\u201d (The Wild Strawberries), referring to the group\u2019s uniqueness. The members are: Emma and Brenda, who sell tacos; Maria, who sells food, clothes and gold-layered jewelry; Celia and Liliana, who sell typical snacks.\r\n\r\nBrenda is a young mother of four children. One of them has a problem with his legs, so he regularly attends therapy. She grew up as part of a family that sells tacos; this is how the love for the work formed, and now she has had her own taqueria for fourteen years. In just six months she managed to acquire a steady clientele, and with that, was able to grow her business. The evolution is apparent, as in the beginning only she and her mother sold the tacos, and now she employs three more people. Part of her success is based on the great taste of the product and the excellent customer service she provides, such as offering two for one promotions on certain days.\r\n\r\nWith her profits she has provided a good quality of life for her children, especially the older child who attends therapy in the city of Veracruz, which is a couple of hours away from their community. This time her loan will be invested in the purchase of meat, vegetables, tortillas, oil, soft drinks, and gas, so she is able to continue selling Monday through Sunday from 4 pm until midnight. \"I'm glad and happy for the large family that I have, for my children, who I will do everything for, and the taco stand for yielding the desired results. Next I will buy more tables and chairs to expand the business.\"\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken at Brenda\u2019s taqueria. She, is wearing a white blouse and black cropped pants.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3950,"image":{"id":1886459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

They are engaged in cattle and sheep breeding, in beekeeping, and in cultivating family-owned land where they harvest beans. The family members get income from selling agricultural products at the local market. To make the business more profitable and increase the number of sales, Armais wants to purchase a car and start trading in other villages. The startup program, that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 3,600 GEL for purchasing a secondhand car. \r\n\r\nArmais will sell the products door-to-door and will get more income. The loan will help him to add his bit to the family's welfare and increase the living condition of the family.\r\n \r\nThis hardworking and motivated man awaits your support.

She is married to an ordinary farmer. Gulchehra and her husband lived through many troubles and joyful events together and raised four children. Gulchehra helps her husband with sowing and gathering the harvest. And her husband helps her at the livestock yard. This is how they have been living together with each other's support for many years.

She displays her merchandise on mannequins and from hooks and she has an extensive variety for the entire family. On Thursdays she buys more merchandise and so that she doesn't lose business, she decided to hire a young woman to run the store for her while she's away. With her earnings she is able to cover her employee's wages, the rent for the store, and also help her husband with household expenses. Additionally, she is able to reinvest in her store by buying accessories and stylish clothing. Santa offers easy payment terms to her preferred customers who continually pay her either weekly or twice a month.\r\n\r\nThe loan that Santa is requesting will be used to buy pants, shorts, t-shirts, and blouses which are the items in greatest demand.

Thanks to Babban Gona's support, Dalladi now has the opportunity to increase his yields and income and use his extra earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1893745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase improved farm inputs that will increase his farm's yields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-06-02T23:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-02T23:10:05Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dalladi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":55149,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":55149}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-06-18T01:16:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":890278,"name":"Hawa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hawa is a single parent with three children, between the ages of three and twenty six years.

day, lenders! Now it\u2019s time for you to meet one of Ruma\u2019s agents, Sarwan. \n\nSarwan lives in North Bogor, located about one hour and thirty minutes drive from Jakarta, the capital city. Sarwan lives there with his wife and his three children (two daughters and one son). \n\nSarwan owns a stall where he sells daily consumer products and mobile airtime credits for his community. He feels happy that he joined Ruma because for him, Ruma\u2019s services are the best. \n\nHe learnt a lot about how to manage his business from Ruma, as well as how to manage his income and savings. His community sees him as a trusted and informative mobile service provider.\n\nAs the business grows, Sarwan is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits for his community, especially on weekends, so his community can easily connect with their loved ones, no matter how far they are apart. As seen in the photo, \n\nSarwan is the one who is standing in his own small stall. He will be thankful for your support\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1875526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase additional prepaid airtime credit to sell to community members who want to use mobile phones to connect with loved ones.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bogor Utara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-06-02T23:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-02T23:50:13Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarwan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":7000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-06-26T17:55:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":894625,"name":"Isuwa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isuwa is a Babban Gona farmer from Pegi Village.

She has a higher education. She raises animals as the main income for her family, having started 15 years ago. Thanks to her hard work, today Guliypa has four cows and five sheep.

When a customer orders, Abdullah will submit the order via SMS, and within 5-10 days, the product will be delivered to the customer.
