In 2007, he started his own business as a farmer with eight years of previous experience. He learned this occupation from his father who also works as a farmer. He owns a large piece of land where he cultivates multiple types of fruits and vegetables according to the season. He delivers the harvest to a big vegetable market in his town and to some small markets. He is thankful for his business income and he plans to make more profit by adding more cultivation. He is requesting $1,200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase a farming machine to renovate his soil and add more seeds to expand his production.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\n\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and the mother of four children. Mavlyuda's lack of a stable job and the low productivity of her husband's business didn't leave enough money to pay the expenses of the home and of her little daughter. This was the reason why Mavlyuda decided to start her own business 10 years ago, selling fabrics for traditional dresses. Little by little she has made her business grow, and by offering her clients the chance to pay in installments, her orders are getting bigger. <P>\r\n\r\nNow her business is running normally. However, she would like to continue bettering herself and her business. She is asking for a loan of 2500 Somoni that she will pay back in 10 months. With this money, Mavlyuda will be able to buy seasonal fabrics for national dresses. The power to help her business grow is in your hands.<P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Radjabali is 46 years old. He lives with his wife and their three children. He has been breeding cattle for more than 13 years and he is trying to improve the breed in order to increase his prices. He invests time and money in the feed and medicines that the animals require. He enjoys this work, especially getting milk from his cows, which his wife sells in local markets. Radjabali keeps going thanks to the help and enthusiasm of his children, who, along with his wife, help him care for the animals. \r\n\r\nRadjabali needs a loan of $800 USD to buy more calves to expand his business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

This is how plant selling became their principle source of income and where they put all their efforts.  Her husband travels to other cities selling and distributing the plants, while she buys and contracts with the suppliers.  The best part of her work is that it only keeps her occupied for 3 days a week: Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, which leaves her spare time to dedicate to her baby daughter.  One day they will plan another type of business for her days off, but they still haven\u2019t decided what to do and also they do not want to neglect their daughter.  They believe that spending time with her is just as important as time spent working. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and Mar\u00eda promises to be very responsible with the repayments.

livelihood for eight years in Kayunga. A father of four, he decided to engage in this business because coffee is Uganda's premier cash crop which sells well, especially if one is selling it to the many coffee cooperative unions all over the country. Coffee was Uganda's number one foreign exchange export earner in the early 80's. Though times have changed for the worse because of the fluctuations in coffee prices on the international markets, many Ugandans are not about to dispense with this business any time soon. Many people in their late 50s speak with nostalgia about the good old days coming back, when they were able to give their children a good education with earnings from their coffee sales. \r\n\r\nThere has been recent improvement with better coffee prices from the re-emerging coffee unions to coffee farmers who have good-grade coffee. As a result, many coffee farmers, Godfrey included, can now bask in the glow of improved sales profits. Godfrey took over this business from his late father. Weekly, he makes sales profits totaling Ugandan shillings 60,000. He says he is going to use this Kiva loan to purchase young coffee plants to grow. He envisages being able to make more profits when the plants mature and produce better high-grade, robust Arabica coffee to sell."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":813015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase young coffee plants to grow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kayunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 32.866667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-16T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Godfrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hassan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siraje","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lawrence","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gorret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":666666.67,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:23:40Z","rounded_local_amount":672958.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227248980},{"amount":487.82,"local_amount":1258883.33,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-01T09:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1270764.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868550},{"amount":287.18,"local_amount":741116,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:22:10Z","rounded_local_amount":748110.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648384},{"amount":222.81,"local_amount":575002,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":580428.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313745},{"amount":263.98,"local_amount":681232,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-02T09:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":687661.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275372},{"amount":29.88,"local_amount":77100,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-28T08:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":77827.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264223719}],"funded_date":"2011-07-17T05:53:14Z","paid_date":"2012-04-28T08:05:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hannon","image":null}},{"id":320632,"name":"Esterlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esterlita is a 31-year-old woman, married and humbly residing in Clarin, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

He will use the loan to purchase merchandise so he can offer a wider selection to his customers and increase his income. With the rotation of supplies in his business, he plans to repay the loan within six months.\r\n\r\nThe well-being of Iskandar\u2019s family and his business are in your hands. Iskandar and his family are sincerely grateful for your support.

She has been a farmer since she was a little girl because her parents were poorl and they depended on their crops.  When she got married, her husband farmed leased farmlands.  To date they have been unable to purchase their own land.  However, they lease four manzanas (a traditional unit of land area in Central America) on which they grow tomatoes, peppers and radishes.  \r\n\r\nSometimes, due to drought or lack of fertilizers, they lose part of the crops in which they have invested all their seed; this makes it very difficult.  For this reason, the need arises to seek financing to buy the necessary manure, fertilizers and seed because they are about to plant tomato and peppers.  They hope to produce good product that will sell at the best market prices so that they can meet household expenses and repay the loan on time.

Victor is a dedicated father and producer. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvesting of Cayenne peppers in an effort to improve living conditions. He works in cooperation with his family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities.  In addition to his agricultural activity, Victor feels it is important to be an active member of his community. As a result, he dedicates a significant portion of his time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Victor and his family live is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Victor is working hard towards the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labor. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Victor and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All laborial and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Victor, with the help of his family members in the region of Upala. The production cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Victor planted his peppers 4 months ago and will expect to harvest in the next 8 months. Typically, he dedicates the hours from 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM everyday to his agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial (PROPICA) is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Victor and other producers in the Upala community face is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA, represents a unique opportunity to Victor, his family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Victor wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. He wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his home and neighborhood. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":618243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase of agricultural ingredients and chemicals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Upala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T20:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65568.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66661.05},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67770.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":178.28,"local_amount":89141.9,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":90692.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289985},{"amount":68.06,"local_amount":34031.6,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-29T07:55:39Z","rounded_local_amount":34623.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227043876},{"amount":153.66,"local_amount":76826.5,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":78163.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232804911}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T08:55:11Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":242789,"name":"Lourdes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lourdes S. is from the village of Poblacion 2, Clarin, Misamis Occ.

","en":"Sra. Ivet Azucena P. Orizaba lives in a town called San Jose Purua in the Mexican state of Michoacan.  It's a beautiful place known for its hot springs and sulfur baths.  Dona Ivet, 24, married very young, in her third year of high school, and has worked at caring for her house and family since then.  Her husband didn't let her study because he wanted her to take care of their son.  Dona Ivet, as she likes to be called, is applying for a loan to invest in her cellular phone shop.  She wants to buy cell phones, accessories and telephone minutes to resell.  She has operated the business for approximately 3 year in a space that she borrowed from relatives.  She says that she buys her merchandise from an authorized dealer in Zitacuaro because she pays less there and can earn more when she resells the merchandise.  She likes the business very much because it allows her to keep an eye on her children.  Sra. Ivet is married to Sr. Enrique who sells seasonal flowers.

One must strive hard to provide sustenance for the crops to achieve an abundant harvest. \r\n\r\nHe is 33 years old and had been cultivating his farm for almost 10 years. Marlon earned about PHP 30,000 at the last cropping season in May from his own farm land. Net income earned every harvest is used to sustain the education of his three children.\r\n\r\nMarlon is now asking for a loan of PHP 10,000 due to insufficient funds to buy the seeds, fertilizers and insecticides used in farming. With the help of this loan, he can improve his rice production. \r\n\r\nMarlon hopes to continue growing as an entrepreneur.

The Sare Doro group is from the village of Colufifa in the southern Casamance region of Senegal, until recently the scene of a devastating separatist conflict.  In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cBackground:  Casamance is a very remote region of Senegal.  It has the potential to be rich, but is nevertheless very poor.  Its population is young and it is the women who dominate the local economy and constitute the engine of development.  However, the majority of young girls and women do not have any source of income, and this is the cause of the exponential growth in migration away from rural areas.<p>\r\n\r\nPurpose:  The objectives of this trading business include restarting local economic activities, motivating young women to stay in their home villages by creating revenue-generating activities, creating revenue for women at the household level, fighting poverty by increasing income, guaranteeing the grassroots development of the locality, fighting malnutrition among mothers and children, and providing good-quality products to the inhabitants of the village.<p>\r\n\r\nBusiness activities:  This business consists of lending money to the women of the village group so that they can trade products such as fresh, dried and smoked fish, sugar, palm oil, vegetables, rice, oil, etc.  At the same time, the women will purchase millet, cashew nuts, and other specialties of their own village to resell in the large town markets.  This will allow the women to make a profit and repay the loan.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground<p>\r\n\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.<p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Business description translated from French by Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance Fund. <\/b> \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u00abContexte : Contexte :\r\nLa Casamance est une r\u00e9gion tr\u00e8s enclav\u00e9e du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

She is married and the mother of three children. Two have completed senior high school while the youngest still attends school. She has been a local manufacturer of palm oil and palm kernel oil for the past three years. Palm oil and palm kernel oil are produced from palm kernel. The palm kernel oil is a by-product of palm oil, which is produced first. The palm kernel is processed through various stages to obtain the palm kernel oil, which is used to prepare many local dishes like frying fish and pastries. Afia produces and supplies these oils to food vendors to prepare their meals. However, her production is on the low side as a result of insufficient working capital to buy a processing machine.\r\n \r\nShe wants to use the loan to buy more bags of palm kernel and an electric milling machine to reduce the manual effort and produce larger quantities. In addition to the oil business, she also sells smoked fish to earn income to support her business; she buys her stock of fish from a town called Yeji which is close to her village and retails it to customers in the village.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She owns a business venture, catching & selling farm-raised fish .  Pesi has 2 years of experience in this business.  Pesi needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional fish to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Pesi joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Pesi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Pesi A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is married to a mechanic and has 2 children, aged 7 and 16 years. She has 1 additional dependent, who lives with her. She came to live with Hawa to attend school in the city and also help with domestic work.  \r\n\r\nIn 2001, Hawa established her secondhand electrical equipment\/appliances, carpet etc. business. She began her business because her parents could not afford to pay her school fees. Since she could not further her studies, she joined her mother in business, and when her mother died she had to partner with her elder brother in the business.  Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 2,508,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Hawa has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase 10 small pieces of secondhand carpet @ Le150,000 each, 10 DVD players @ Le125,000 each, 10 rolls of electrical cable @ Le100,000 each, 10 boxes of plugs @ Le80,000 each and 450 packets of light bulbs @ Le1,000 each. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 976,000. In the future, Hawa plans to build a house.  \r\n\r\nShe feels good that her business is growing.  She is planning to expand and give her children a better life.  She is excited about the future because in acquiring this loan she will be able to buy more stock to add to her existing business. Her major challenge is the high rate of taxation.  Competition is low as she is the only retailer in that area.  She serves people around the town and customers from interior villages.  She serves about 12 people per day as she offers quality products at affordable prices to suit her customers.  She buys her goods in Freetown three times a month through public transport.  She uses his profit to buy more stock for her business.  \r\n\r\nHawa is planning to expand by acquiring more loans and making better profits so that she will be able to achieve her plans.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education program."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":101777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. <P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":140659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To expand her business by purchasing additional African cloth.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-18T21:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-02T16:12:52Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-05-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":199168},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-06-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226059},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-07-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:00Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":255394},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-08-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":284137},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-09-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-18T07:23:01Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":314314},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-02T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":345745},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347571},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:27Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970191},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886441},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435727}],"funded_date":"2008-03-19T16:12:52Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":45299,"name":"Blanca","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Blanca belongs to \u201cLa Familia\u201d Communal Bank, located at Av.

AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":262907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To ask for a loan to buy more vegetable seeds for cultivation.

Oiniso is 45 years old. She and her husband, an engineer, have two children of school age. Oiniso has the specialty of kindergarten teacher. However, for several years already,  she has been selling clothing for kids and socks for women and kids. <P>\r\n\r\nThe income from the business is spent for educating her children, as she and her husband are dreaming that their children will have higher education.

Oiniso promises to repay the loan in 9 months and thanks all supporting her. <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The saj is used to make several types of bread, including <i>markouk<\/i> (thinned) bread and doughy confections, or mankoucheh. A mankoucheh looks like a folded pizza; the most common toppings are <i>zaatar<\/i> (thyme), <i>jebneh<\/i> (cheese) and <i>lahm bi ajin<\/i> (minced meat).

Two of them live on their own and the youngest lives with her in a modest house located in southern Lima. \r\n\r\nSince coming to the city, she has had countless jobs. Of all of them the one that had the best results was selling products from her area: quinoa, beans, corn and other grains. She does this in the stall she has in her district's market. With the profits, she has bought the equipment needed to cook the vegetable stews she also sells from her stall. Thanks to this activity, Felicita has been able to educate her children and offer them the best she can, since she doesn't have a husband. A short time ago, she broke her arm, but she expects to recuperate quickly and continue working. In the meantime, her son is taking over the stall.  \r\n\r\nThis is her 17th loan with MFP and she has shown that she is a very responsble customer with her payments.

She is married and has 7 children ranging in age from 19 to 38 years old. Four of her children are working and 3 attend school. She lives in her own house and helps support her niece, who lives with her.\r\n\r\nCeleste moved from Manhi\u00e7a to the district of Namaacha with her husband, who was transferred there for work. She started a business selling meals in the barracks on the border with Swaziland; these were later closed by the government due to the pollution in the area. With the help of her neighbor, who did well raising poultry, she built a chicken coop by her house and started raising chickens. She has also become very successful with this venture. She's raised hundreds of chicks and has spent around 50,000 Meticais in doing so, while she can sell each chicken for 125 Meticais. She staggers the age of the chicks so that she always has mature chickens to sell. She sells most of her chickens wholesale, since she saves on feed that way, and she's made a profit of 12,500 Meticais. She also sells directly to local consumers, though her profit doing this is only 10,000 Meticais. She uses this income to cover household expenses and also saves some in her bank account. \r\n\r\nCeleste has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through friends who also work with the institution. This is her 5th loan, for the amount of 20,000 Meticais. She plans to use this money to buy chicks, feed and vitamins in order to increase the number of chickens she can raise, as she want more chickens to sell during the coming holidays. Her earlier loans were for 10,000, 10,500 and 25,000 Meticais and were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe is confident that she will be able to repay the loan ahead of schedule and take out new loan to buy a pushcart that will help her in her daily work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":648533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

She is very dynamic, and stands out through her honesty and courage. Her business allows her to make a very large contribution to the household expenses; her husband, a retired teacher, cannot cover all of these expenses on his retirement pension. Mrs. T., who has a gift for managing her business with exemplary precision, was able to pay back her first credit without any difficulties. Now she is seeking to improve her business by increasing her stock of corn during periods when it is abundant and reselling it when it is in short supply. This new project requires more resources than Mrs. T. currently has. To achieve her goal, she is asking for a credit of $850 that will serve as capital to buy, store, and resell corn. The profit on the sales will help her to better meet the expenses of her household and acheive financial independence.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Lisa Molle, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de sept (7) enfants, Madame T.

Rocio is a hardworking woman who grew up in a family whose business was making furniture such as beds as well as manufacturing mattresses.  During her years growing up, Rocio dedicated a lot of time to learning about the sales of furniture and that's why five years ago she decided to start selling the furniture produced in her parents factory on her own.   Now, with the experience she has gained, she would like to set up her own furniture shop.  Every week she produces pieces to sell, trying to build a better future for her own family.  It's hard work, but she produces pieces made with metal which are beautiful and high quality.   She would like to grow this business and is requesting a loan to buy the paints and metals needed to produce her furniture.  Your help is very important in helping her reach her goals.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nRoc\u00edo, es una mujer valerosa  con gran disposici\u00f3n para el trabajo, ella creci\u00f3 en una familia que se dedica  a la fabricaci\u00f3n de muebles de metal entre ellas camas y camarotes (camas de dos pisos), tambi\u00e9n confeccionaban colchones. Durante todos estos a\u00f1os Roc\u00edo aprendi\u00f3 y se dedic\u00f3 durante mucho tiempo a la venta de muebles y es as\u00ed como hace cinco a\u00f1os se anim\u00f3 a vender lo que producen en la f\u00e1brica de su padre de manera independiente.Hoy con el paso de los a\u00f1os y con la experiencia adquirida piensa implementar su propio taller de fabricaci\u00f3n de muebles debido a que el conocimiento y buen manejo de recursos le provienen de familia. Por ahora d\u00eda a d\u00eda  sale  todos los domingos a comercializar  lo que produjo durante los 6 d\u00edas anteriores en b\u00fasqueda de un futuro mejor para sus dos hijos que la motivan y fortalecen para superar situaciones de escasez econ\u00f3mica.  A pesar del trabajo duro que requiere la fabricaci\u00f3n de muebles asume esta labor sin miramientos  y realiza bellos trabajos en metal de excelente calidad y de magn\u00edfica  presentaci\u00f3n. Desea acrecentar su negocio y es por ello que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar pinturas y algunos fierros que son insumos b\u00e1sicos para la fabricaci\u00f3n de los bellos muebles de metal y acude a aquellas personas solidarias que decidan apoyarla.

She lives in her own house with her two children, and longs to be successful. Her work selling shoes is a hobby as much as it is a job. Ever since she was a little girl she's loved shoes, and now that she's working with them she's very happy. She's a cheerful, talkative saleswoman, and she's always looking for the best way to sell her merchandise and deplete her stock. She enjoys advising her customers on what shoes are in fashion or which go best with their outfits. She's been working in the business 18 years and hopes to have a larger store where she can also sell clothing. What she likes least is having to stay inside all day without being able to go out to take care of other things. This is Breny's first loan with MFP, and she knows she has to make her payments on time and is prepared to do so, since she wants to receive other loans in the future. She's very happy with her community bank. She will use the requested loan to buy more shoes and better stock her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":305669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-24T18:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Breny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":168.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012473},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":168.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596063},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":168.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990327},{"amount":54.29,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:40Z","rounded_local_amount":168.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211450},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":168.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640955},{"amount":53.6,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":166.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080421}],"funded_date":"2009-04-24T23:10:35Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":106775,"name":"Sen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sen K., 47, has a small store next to her house where she sells produce items.

Their granddaughter also lives with them sometimes, since their daughter is independent. For the past two years, Rosa has been selling jewelry by catalog, thanks to her daughter, who introduced her to the business world and encouraged her. Her daughter used to sell catalog jewelry, but as time went by she found more stable work and passed her catalog jewelry business on to her mother. Rosa has fully taken over the business, now, and it is going very well. She is selling more and more merchandise thanks to her cordiality, friendliness, and persuasiveness. The jewelry she sells is of guaranteed high quality and comes bathed in different karats of gold. Rosa really enjoys her work, since it keeps her busy and helps generate some extra income to add to to her husband's earnings.

Mar\u00eda del Carmen es toda una experta en negocios, porque siempre, desde el a\u00f1o 1986, ha tenido uno: el primero fue un restaurante con su esposo, cuando \u00e9ste se pension\u00f3; luego una peluquer\u00eda en su propia casa, al que adicion\u00f3 la venta de prendas de oro y en el 1991 viajaba y tra\u00eda mercanc\u00eda para la venta desde Maicao, municipio fronterizo con Venezuela, pero cuando esta forma de negociar no fue rentable y empez\u00f3 a encontrar en Barranquilla mercanc\u00eda a buen precio, se dedic\u00f3 exclusivamente a la venta de esta mercanc\u00eda variada , mediante el sistema de cr\u00e9dito. Mar\u00eda ha recibido 6 cr\u00e9ditos con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo que ha amortizado efectivamente, su credikiva es su s\u00e9ptimo cr\u00e9dito, con \u00e9l comprar\u00e1 una lavadora, ropa, calzado y una balanza para negocio, todo esto ya encargado. Los financiamientos otorgados a Mar\u00eda del Carmen han sido muy valiosos, porque con ellos ha logrado utilidades, convertidas hoy en aportes para su hogar, especialmente en lo que tiene que ver con la alimentaci\u00f3n, el vestuario de sus hijos, apoyo a sus nietos y el poder contar siempre un capital efectivo para compras de oportunidad e inversi\u00f3n para su negocio. Aun sigue con el sue\u00f1o de tener un restaurante bien organizado, porque le apasiona el \u00e1rea de preparaci\u00f3n de alimentos. Sus desaf\u00edos est\u00e1n relacionados con la oferta de mercanc\u00edas que hace la competencia, que muchas veces suele ser m\u00e1s econ\u00f3mica, pero ella est\u00e1 en la tarea de explicarle a sus clientes, la relaci\u00f3n del precio con la durabilidad como elementos de calidad, con la que ella trabaja. Mar\u00eda F. es una mujer muy activa participa en la Junta de acci\u00f3n comunal del barrio donde vive, donde hace mucha gesti\u00f3n comunitaria, por eso la conocen en Soledad y adem\u00e1s siempre est\u00e1 a la expectativa de captar nuevos clientes reales que le signifiquen ingresos. ","en":"Mar\u00eda F. G. makes a living selling all types of merchandise, especially household appliances, clothing, and shoes.  She lives in the city of Soledad, which is 15 minutes away from Barranquilla, with her husband and four children who range in age from 18 to 39.  Mar\u00eda del Carmen is an expert at her business because she has always worked in her own venture since 1986.  The first business she had was a restaurant she managed with her husband when he became a pensioner.  Later she started a beauty salon in her home and eventually began selling gold jewelry in 1991.  Mar\u00eda also traveled and brought back merchandise to sell from Maicao, a town that lies near the border with Venezuela.  Whenever her traveling retail business became less profitable, she began purchasing merchandise in Barranquilla at a better price.  Now she devotes herself exclusively to selling different types of merchandise on credit.  \r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda has received six previous loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and has paid them off effectively.  This Kiva loan will be her seventh one and she will use it to purchase a washing machine, clothing, shoes, and a scale for her business since she has already received orders for these items.  The loans that were provided to Mar\u00eda del Carmen have been valuable because they helped her generate income to buy products for her home, especially food and clothing for her children.  She also supports her grandchildren, so she would like to have sufficient capital so that she can take advantage of buying opportunities and investments in her business.  She continues to dream of having a well-organized restaurant once again because she is passionate about preparing food.  Her greatest challenge with her retail business is competition because there have been many instances in which other merchants sell goods that are much cheaper.  However, it is her job to explain to her customers the relationship between price and specific elements of quality such as durability.  \r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda is an active board member of the community action committee in her neighborhood, which does a lot of work related to community development.  She is well-known in Soledad and is always looking for new customers to help generate more income.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She separated from her partner many years ago, with whom she has a son that already has his own home. That is why she lives alone in her own home, located on a farmhouse of Huaylahuichan. Despite her age and living alone, she still has goals to achieve, because the driving force of her life is her son and because she loves the land that saw her be born and grow up. \"I grew up here eating corn, boiled potatoes, and dirt. I can't get accustomed to another place, because the noise of the city bothers me and you always have to eat there,\" says Juana, who cultivates corn, potatoes, and peas on the land that she inherited from her parents. She works alone. What she likes the most is to plant alfalfa because after cutting it down, it sprouts up to four times and can last three years with a good output. \"You have to water them once a week,\" she comments. At the same time, she raises 150 guinea pigs in her dwelling. She sells them mostly to be consumed (meat) and to be produced (raised). According to her, she says that this time she sold a good quantity of them so that she could pay her bills. Since her activities are fairly profitable, she is thinking about living with her grandson Marco, who is 15 years old. That is why she plans to focus on the business of selling alfalfa and guinea pigs--she wants to support him with the costs of his studies. Now she is recuperating from the loss that she had in the pea harvest. She sold them below price because they were ruined by changes in the climate. She belongs to the communal bank \"Nueva esperanza\" [\"New Hope\"]. This is the 7th loan with MFP where she expresses, \"I didn't trust another entity, because they offer us benefits and in the end don't follow through.
