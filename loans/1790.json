","en":"Shahnoza is 22 years old.  She comes from the Pyandj ditrict of Tajikistan.  Her husband raises livestock.  Shahnoza has two children.  For several years already, she has been cultivating a plot of land, growing vegetables and enjoying good farming conditions.

She has done this work for almost five years. She is responsible for tagging, packing, and sometimes the shipping of clothes and garments. \r\n\r\nLorejoy is still single, but her responsibilities in the family cannot be discounted. In the Philippines, where families are known to be so closely knit, single persons are expected to help in their family\u2019s expenses, from basic needs such as food, utilities, siblings\u2019 education, parent\u2019s medicines, and sometimes house construction or repair. \r\n\r\nLorejoy\u2019s ancestral house in the province has been wearing away due to frequent typhoons in the Philippines. She cannot save enough money for the needed housing repairs because low-income earners like her can hardly make both ends meet. She does not have access to banks and other financial institutions. This is the reason why she is prone to be victimized by money-lenders who charge very high interest rates and capture automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nLorejoy is thankful that she has other options as a member of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*. She is looking forward to your help so that she can help provide the needed housing repairs and improvement. This is very important, so their house would be strong enough for the next typhoon that will visit the Philippines.  \r\n\r\nAs a responsible and loving daughter, Lorejoy desires to make her family happy at all times, uplift them from poverty, own a decent house and start a small business in the future. Of course she also dreams for herself a responsible husband and eventually a happy family of her own. \r\n\r\nShe meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n*The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services. \r\n\r\n**CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before they start their daily work routines. Bible readings, prayer devotions, and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1893184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for housing repairs and improvement.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-03T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-03T04:00:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorejoy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.68,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4085.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314507},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2042.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523202},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2042.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433631},{"amount":45.82,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2042.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954562},{"amount":45.82,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2042.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044523}],"funded_date":"2015-06-09T13:05:57Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lavender","image":1304534}},{"id":894685,"name":"Helen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helen is 42 years old and married with four children.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

She has been working there for thirteen long years that proves her patience and dedication to work.  As a Roving Quality Controller, she is responsible for inspecting the quality of products as well as supervising some levels of the workforce.  She also completes the delicate task of recording products and items.  It\u2019s challenging for her to supervise some disobedient co-workers but she can manage them efficiently. \r\n\r\nPerlita is still single but her responsibilities in the family cannot be discounted.  In the Philippines where families are known to be so closely knit, single persons are expected to help in their family\u2019s expenses, from basic needs such as food, utilities, sibling education, parent\u2019s medicines, and sometimes house construction or repair.  Perlita\u2019s ancestral house has been wearing away due to frequent visits of typhoons in the Philippines.  She cannot save enough money for house repairs because low-income earners like her can hardly make ends meat.  She has no access to banks and other financial institutions.  This is the reason why she is prone to be victimized by usurious money-lenders who charge very high interest rates and capture automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral.  Perlita is thankful that she has other options being a member of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.  She is very much looking forward to your help so she can help provide for needed house repairs and improvements.  This is very important so their house can be strong enough for the next typhoon to hit the Philippines.  \r\n\r\nAs a responsible and loving daughter, Perlita desires to make her family happy at all times, uplift them from poverty, own a decent house, and start a small business in the future.  Of course she also dreams of having a responsible husband and eventually a happy family of her own.  She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n*The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services. \r\n\r\n**CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before they start their daily work routines.

Sadly, she has no available money but she doesn\u2019t want to ignore her sister\u2019s request. This is why Mary Ann asks for your support to help her with this problem. She hopes you would be one of God\u2019s instruments to lighten her burden.  \r\n\r\nMary Ann dreams of having an abundant life someday, especially for their child.

She is married to Ponciano, a security guard, and she is a mother to her children who have their own respective families already. She manages their household while operating the business to augment their income and meet their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLolita has an ornamental plant business. She grows garden plants that are native to the Philippines like ylang-ylang, golden shower and dahlias, and also a variety of hanging plants and other similar plants. Her regular customers are local tourists, neighbors and the nearby community. She earns a minimum of PHP 3,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her expand her farm, she is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan which she will use to buy fertilizer and various kinds of garden seedlings, pots and nets to grow healthier ornamental plants. She thanks God for her healthy and beautiful ornamental plants and the financial help that will be given to her, for it will surely help to provide for their daily needs. \r\n\r\nLolita's dream is for her ornamental business to flourish. She prays that God will grant her and her family good health and long life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members*  to share stories of her work every week, and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1893919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

They are living in San Pedro, Laguna with their only child. \r\n\r\nEveryday, Joseph travels to GMA, Cavite to work as a presser in a garment factory. For three years now, he does the pressing, folding and packaging of finished clothing. Sometimes, he finds difficulty in the long hours of pressing clothes, but nonetheless, he is happy with his work. \r\n\r\nJoseph and Daisy are already preparing for the growing financial demands in raising their child. He wants to have additional income by procuring more items for sale in their variety store. Particularly, he wants to add perfume and cologne because he noticed that it\u2019s in demand nowadays. He\u2019s confident that he can efficiently manage that kind of business with the help of his supportive wife. \r\n\r\nHe fervently prays that through your help, he can obtain additional capital for their business. As a member of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*, he won\u2019t have any problem in repaying the loan because it will be deducted from his salary every pay day.\r\n \r\nIt is his dream that their only child will finish college because it is the most valued inheritance that they can give to their child. He also desires to have a vehicle someday that he can use for his business. \r\n\r\nJoseph meets up with his co-fellowship** members to share stories of his life and work. \r\n\r\n*The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services. \r\n\r\n**CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before they start their daily work routines.

She is married to Eleuterio, a teacher, and they have four children, of whom one is in college, two are in high school, and the other one is already working. She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income, to meet their daily personal and household needs, and to send her three children to school. \r\n\r\nNelita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and then selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 800 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are their source of income to meet their daily expenses and to send her children to school. She thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her.\r\n\r\nNelita trusts that God will help her store to prosper so she can send all her children to college.

She has a secondary education and is a happy and hardworking woman.  About 13 years ago, she got involved in animal husbandry and agriculture.  Having started with a capital of 1,000 som (KGS), she managed to develop her business and she currently makes a monthly income of up to 15,000 som (KGS).  She currently has two cows, 15 sheep and two horses on her farm.  She also grows barley and potatoes for resale on 1.25 hectares of land.

When a customer orders, Yulia will submit the order via SMS and, within 5-10 days, the product will be delivered to the customer. With Mapan, Yulia believes that her community will be able to have access to higher quality products with better prices. \n\nAs seen in the photo, Yulia is the one who is sitting and smiling.

Milk from the cows is sold, providing a stable monthly income for the family, and then once the calves reach 18 months old they too will be sold. To provide animals with food he works two hectares of land, which he inherited from his father. \r\n\r\nNow he is facing a major problem: the shelter for the cows is too small. Right now the calves stay out in the open during the day but at night or when it rains they are housed in the small shelter. At the moment they are all able to fit but as the calves grow and get older, half of them will be without shelter. To solve this problem, Victor needs a loan to build a stable. The stable will enable him to increase the number of cows he can raise at one time. As he increases the amount of cows he can raise, he will be able to bring in more revenue, which could result in the creation of new jobs for the

Through Babban Gona\u2019s input loan, Mikailu will have access to the best farm inputs in the market such as fertilizers, herbicides, and improved seeds, which will help him earn yields of up to 30 bags of maize\/hectare, double the Nigerian national average of 14 bags. This will see him increase his household income considerably. Thanks to Babban Gona's support, Mikailu now has the opportunity to increase his yields and income and use his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program.

He only completed the third grade and later dedicated himself to working with his father as a farmer. However, Marvin also told us that he worked for businesses nearby where he lived. He remembers that during the coffee harvesting season he would go to harvest coffee with his family. Currently, he is married and has four children. Marvin says that he will support his children with their studies for as long as he can because studying in the best thing that exists. He works on farms or on nearby properties constructing homes and harvesting coffee and performing farm labor. Also, during the coffee harvesting season he harvests coffee with his family to make a little extra money. \r\n\r\nIn this community there is no electricity and it is because of this that he is seeking a loan to purchase a solar system which will be installed on his home which will provide a great benefit now that his children are studying and doing their homework that they have after class at night. In addition, to harvest coffee he needs to get up early to get ready and get moving. His wife also gets up early and she has to light the house with candles and focus to prepare their meals when he is working on a job at a local property. Having a solar panel will provide light in a different way and his children will be able to easily work with more comfort on their homework from their classes and his wife will light the kitchen with light produced by the solar panel.

Aged 39, Kadiatou is the mother of six children aged 8 to 19, of whom five are presently in school. \r\n\r\nFamily tradition is anchored in agriculture, the principal source of income and of food self-sufficiency for the household, but agriculture also permits her to ensure self-sufficiency for her family and this has motivated Kadiatou to work in this field for 32 years now. She grows peanuts on her plot of land but like all farmers she has to face difficulties such as lack of rain, of farming supplies, and of high-quality fertilizer. \r\n\r\nKadiatou is beginning her first year with myAgro and she registered because of the system of payment and the training in agricultural techniques as well as in the hope of expanding her yield through the services myAgro offers. This year Kadiatou is making her payments to buy a myAgro package of OPV (openly pollinated variety) seeds and fertilizer to grow peanuts so as to increase her yield on her plot of 0.0625 hectare. \r\n\r\nKadiatou has been growing peanuts for 28 years now for their value as a foodstuff, explaining that peanuts are directly edible for the family and are used as a basic sauce in cooking. She also grows them because they can be sold profitably at the market. With the increase in her yield and her income, Kadiatou plans to diversify her crops. Finally, she also hopes to be able to build a house for her family and pay for the weddings of her children.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1891732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to acquire a package of OPV seeds and fertilizer to grow peanuts in order to increase agricultural productivity on her plot of land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ticko","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-06-03T13:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-03T13:10:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diamba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lansseny","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Camara","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":378500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":378500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":378500,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:21Z","rounded_local_amount":391984.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681401706}],"funded_date":"2015-06-03T18:08:42Z","paid_date":"2015-07-30T12:15:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":894785,"name":"Muhammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muhammad is a 33-year-old married man from Dier El-Balah city.

We will take advantage of this assistance to the maximum extent possible.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1890890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise for her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Los Olivos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.851111 -76.390556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2015-06-03T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-03T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asuncion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":425,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":433.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681341480},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":425,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-20T12:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":433.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":697327174},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":425,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":433.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711714483},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":425,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":433.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730984676}],"funded_date":"2015-06-03T23:12:50Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T14:08:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":894849,"name":"Bebenia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bebenia is 52 years old and married, with two children.

Traditionally, Sekou\u2019s family engaged in farm work, the main source of revenue and food for the household. Sekou also likes farming and has been doing it for 42 years. Sekou grows corn on his field. His challenges are low rainfall and the lack of farm supplies and quality seeds. \r\n\r\nSekou is starting his first year with myAgro. He has signed up because of an installment plan offered and the positive opinion of friends and family of myAgro, as well as because of an opportunity for training in agricultural techniques. This year Sekou  is making payments on on a pack of myAgro OPV [Open Pollinated Variety] seeds and fertilizers to grow corn and increase his yield of corn on his field of 0.5 ha [1.2 acres].

Consumption of goat is second only to beef in Zambia, but unlike beef, it is rare to find goat in the markets of Lusaka and other cities.\n\nZamgoat not only addresses the growing demand by urban consumers, but at the same time addresses the poverty of the rural farmers, by monetizing the herds of goats they traditionally raise, for prestige more than income. Zamgoat is a mission-driven for-profit, with a mission of alleviating poverty of these farmers.\n\nZamgoat has been doing this for over three years. In that time they have worked with over 200 farmers, processed and sold over 2,300 goats, and earned over US$150,000. It has increased the income of those farmers by 10%. Given a country of 14 million people, the opportunity to grow is tremendous.\n\nWith this loan, Zamgoat will increase their sales. The money will be spent on more processing equipment, as well as refrigerated display cases in their retail store in Lusaka, Zambia, plus refrigerators behind the scenes for their wholesale distribution.

Her income will help cover her family\u2019s daily needs and fund her children's education. \r\n\r\nMarlyn hopes to expand her ornamental farm. She aims to improve her family's quality of life.

This enabled him to improve the quality of life of his children as well as improve his house.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, this hard-working man has decided to request a loan from Kiva and MiCredito to purchase more rice, beans, and corn. Jose's business  is proving to be very profitable, since he has managed to acquire good sources of grains and a good list of customers. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Jose would like to distribute his products to the markets outside his town.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1890927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, beans, and corn to sell to the grocery stores in his town.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2015-06-03T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-03T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Anibal  \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":149.42,"local_amount":149.42,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:20:24Z","rounded_local_amount":149.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681395762},{"amount":108.16,"local_amount":108.16,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":108.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711528498},{"amount":192.42,"local_amount":192.42,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":192.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731044442}],"funded_date":"2015-06-21T17:13:50Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T16:13:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":894870,"name":"Charlyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of five children, Charlyn works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a food vending business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from general store.

She has one child whom she loves very much. Managing the household while operating a business means she is working hard to continually provide an income to cover the family\u2019s everyday expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nThese days, computers are a large part of everyone\u2019s lives. Figuratively, a computer is like the oxygen everyone needs, everywhere from an individual to the biggest institutions within the society. This is why she has chosen to make computers the center of her chosen business. \r\n<p>\r\nHere in the Philippines most of the population cannot afford to buy their own computer. For those who can\u2019t, entrepreneurs like Marivic have set up internet cafes where customers can have access to the internet at a per-hour cost. Prices usually range from 10 to 15 PHP an hour, which is very reasonable for the average person. \r\n<p>\r\nHowever, what income Marivic gets from her business is not quite enough to provide for all of her household needs. She would like to expand her caf\u00e9 to provide her with an increase in profits. To do so she is humbly requesting a 10,000 PHP loan through Kiva's field partner CCT to buy additional computers and other materials needed to renovate her caf\u00e9. \r\n<p>\r\nBesides her caf\u00e9 Marivic also rents rooms to create additional income and would like to expand this operation. Through these businesses she hopes to have a sustainable livelihood in the near future.

Furthermore, she loves farming and has been doing so for 30 years.\r\n\r\nKorotoumoou grows peanuts on her plot but faces farming difficulties like a lack of farming materials and quality fertiliser.  She is starting her first year with myAgro and registered herself to obtain quality seeds and farming training and techniques, as well as access to the market.\r\n\r\nThis year Korotoumou is making payments to buy a packet of myAgro OPV seeds and fertiliser to increase production on her 0.0625 hectare plot.  It is now 20 years that she has been growing quality peanuts.

She lives with her partner and has a one year old baby. Her business is to give manicures and sell cosmetics. She is a good mother, entrepreneurial, patient, a good listener, caring, responsible and very hardworking. Her business is in the South zone of the city, characterized by having many ecological parks, plazas, and multi-sport fields. It has a warm sub-tropical climate with temperatures that vary throughout the day between 21-35 degrees celsius. \r\n\r\nMarioly has a dark complexion, brown eyes, is of medium height, and has long black hair, which she keeps tied back. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks with her family. She speaks Spanish outside of the home and in her business. In the photo she is the one holding a baby. She shares her life with her partner who works as a driver and her one year old baby, who is beginning to walk. They live in a rented room made from cement and bricks with a corrugated iron roof. The home has drinkable water, electricity and a sewage system.  \r\n\r\nHer need to pay for the medical expenses of her baby led her to lead a bank of people with businesses such as the sale of silverware, the sale of cell phones, the sale of chicken, a neighbourhood store, a tea service and a sewing shop, to request a loan and improve their businesses. \r\n\r\nHer activity is the sale of cosmetics. Everyday she fills a bag with products and goes to all the fairs and markets in search of customers, who she finds in their places of business, offices, stores, etc. Her day begins very early in the morning and ends late at night: \"there is no schedule for the sales and customers can be found at all hours\" she comments.  The advantage of her business is that she has a portfolio of constant customers. The disadvantage is the lack of work capital to supply her business in the market. Her dream is to open a store where she can exhibit and sell her cosmetics,  in order to stop walking as her bag is very heavy. \r\n\r\nShe wishes to buy her merchandise in bulk, to increase her work capital and have a greater variety of products. This is the second loan with the institution in three years for the development of her business. It is for this reason that Marioly is requesting a loan to buy cosmetics in bulk and to use the revenue to pay for the medical expenses of her baby. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4850,"image":{"id":1890794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cosmetics in bulk and pay for her baby's medical expenses with the revenue.

All these goods, along with his farm milk, cheese, and meat, he sells with the help of his nice wife at the city\u2019s wholesale market. Fahrad also sells very little honey, since his beekeeping skills and knowledge of that occupation are still very little. <br \/><br \/>Instead, he considers his land cultivation activities very profitable and hopes that with this partnership with Kiva, he manages to develop it more. With this loan, he wants to buy potato seedlings, fertilizer, and also diesel fuel for his land cultivation work."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":180.46,"image":{"id":1894490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy potato seedlings, fertilizer, and also diesel fuel for his land cultivation work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Gegharkunik region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2015-06-04T00:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-04T00:40:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fahrad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13060},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":17920},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":17690},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17750},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18770},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":18160},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":19570},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":19250},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":19390},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":20470},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":20260},{"due_date":"2016-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":20440},{"due_date":"2016-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":21250},{"due_date":"2016-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":21450},{"due_date":"2016-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":21550},{"due_date":"2016-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":22040},{"due_date":"2016-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":22630},{"due_date":"2016-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":22800},{"due_date":"2016-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":23270},{"due_date":"2017-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":23450},{"due_date":"2017-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":24090},{"due_date":"2017-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":24510},{"due_date":"2017-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":24810},{"due_date":"2017-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":25420}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.42},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.14},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.43},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.72},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.99},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.55},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.92},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.62},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.04},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.25},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.28},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.52},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.88},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.87},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.24},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.59},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.47},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.14,"local_amount":31019,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:14:19Z","rounded_local_amount":31172.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696703402},{"amount":37.93,"local_amount":18063.3,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T17:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":18152.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711635429},{"amount":37.09,"local_amount":17661,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":17748.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731140571},{"amount":40.3,"local_amount":19189,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":19283.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752227471}],"funded_date":"2015-07-04T00:25:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":895019,"name":"Linie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linie is married with nine children.

She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan to buy steel and manufacture the orders of her contractor clients. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. She thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. \r\n\r\nJosefina hopes to have more customers even outside their town. She prays for God to bless her business in order to lead a comfortable life in their old age. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Dilmurod, a 25-year-old modest and pleasant young man.  Dilmurod recently got married, which completely changed his life, as he became a very responsible man.  He used to live alone with his mom, but his young wife now lives with them.  Dilmurod is planning to become a father and to give his future children everything that he wasn't able to receive, particularly an education (since he had to work).  He now wants to be a role model for his children and, for this, he needs to be successful.  At the moment, Dilmurod provides taxi services with his own car.  Given the standard of living of his customers, he doesn't charge much for his services.  Unfortunately, he has recently stopped working because his car broke down.  For this reason, Dilmurod, quickly needs to buy spare parts.  However, he doesn't have the resources to make this purchase, so this loan is his only hope.  He hopes to receive some support.

He is at the head of a large family.  He is a husband, a brother, a father and a grandfather.  He has been involved in animal husbandry for a long time already, as he took over his ancestors' business.  Almost all the residents of this particular district of Tajikistan are involved in agriculture, because there are very few other jobs.  For this reason also, many men have left the country to make a living abroad.  Ismoil had the opportunity to leave at some point, but he chose to stay with his family.  Today, he's actively running his business and he wants to achieve some recognition in his region.  He is taking a loan to increase his livestock headcount.  His savings are not enough to allow him to purchase the number of animals that he needs, so he decided to rely on borrowed funds."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":292.27,"image":{"id":1894411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Qubadiyon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-06-04T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-04T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ismoil","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":338.64},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":350.73},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":368.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":367.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":401.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":403.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":415.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":438.57},{"due_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":448.84},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":458.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":488.05},{"due_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":520.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.18},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.4},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.17},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.81},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.29},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.09},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.18,"local_amount":338.64,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":339.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681400049},{"amount":56.12,"local_amount":350.73,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:27:07Z","rounded_local_amount":351.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696610130},{"amount":58.91,"local_amount":368.19,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":369.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711526156},{"amount":58.77,"local_amount":367.3,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":368.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731041925},{"amount":64.29,"local_amount":401.81,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:07:47Z","rounded_local_amount":403,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752130886}],"funded_date":"2015-06-29T13:05:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":895083,"name":"Marivic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The city of Bacolod in Negros Occidental is one of the areas affected by Typhoon Haiyan, that devastated the Philippines in November, 2013.

Her sales form is going door-to-door. She leaves a credit and collects them weekly. She loves to sell and has been doing it for five years, which have gone really well for her since she has a big clientele. Her best-sellers are the cosmetics and the perfumes.
