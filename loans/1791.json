That is why she wants to request a loan for the purchase of basic ingredients to increase her daily production to 20. \r\n\r\nSelling these products daily allows her to dream of purchasing a commercial fryer in the future, in order to mass produce and see her dream of having a permanent store come closer to becoming reality.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":120.89,"image":{"id":1891510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase basic ingredients in order to increase her daily production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sincelejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2015-06-04T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-04T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.02,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Uverlina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.35,"local_amount":53364,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":59113.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681375209},{"amount":21.18,"local_amount":52194,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-21T12:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":57817.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.65,"payment_id":697633207},{"amount":22.3,"local_amount":55350,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":61313.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.92,"payment_id":711502580},{"amount":23.78,"local_amount":56679,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:21:11Z","rounded_local_amount":62786.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.02,"payment_id":731020199},{"amount":23.26,"local_amount":58717,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":65043.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.43,"payment_id":752108364}],"funded_date":"2015-06-08T17:57:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanora Brennan","image":null}},{"id":895263,"name":"Rolina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rolina works hard to support her family.

She has two daughters who are 2 and 5 years old. She is a saleswoman who earns a living selling clothing for men and women which she sells to friends, relatives and people in her neighbourhood.\r\nRosa started the business for financial need. Years before, she was more worried about being at home and looking after her children but today, as the need is great, she goes out selling these products on a daily basis as the income that she earns is very important for sustaining her household. \r\n\r\nIn order to sell her products, Rosa has to travel long distances. She uses some of her income to pay for transport to get to some neighbourhoods and places far away. The competition in the sector is very strong and therefore she needs to offer good value and quality products.\r\n\r\nRosa is asking for a loan to buy stock of clothes for men and women and to keep some capital to use for stocking up at another time. The reason for this is that she offers her customers they chance to pay in instalments, while she collects the money the capital that she saves is very important for buying any special order placed by a customer.\r\n\r\nAll of her efforts are for two dreams which are to improve the conditions of her home and to pay for the education of her daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":53.54,"image":{"id":1891530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing stock for men and women.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sincelejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2015-06-04T14:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-04T14:30:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.07,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.89,"local_amount":42230,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":42770.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681375212},{"amount":16.82,"local_amount":45336,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-21T12:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":45916.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.31,"payment_id":697633210},{"amount":17.76,"local_amount":46303,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":46895.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.76,"payment_id":731020202}],"funded_date":"2015-06-10T13:27:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lesley Reid","image":null}},{"id":895269,"name":"Mary Jean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Jean is a married woman with five children.

canteen, Letecia is working really hard to improve her business. She knows that the income derived from her canteen varies from time to time. It is affected by the school schedule and presence of students to whom she usually caters. That is why she is targeting to have an alternative business like peanut butter production and direct selling.  She also plans to renovate her canteen in order to make it more desirable to customers. These are the reasons why Letecia needed some help from you in the amount of PhP 60,000. She is positive that she can pay it back because she just holds minor responsibilities now, being separated from her husband, Jimmy, who is running an upholstery business.\r\n\r\nLetecia is living in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, one of the areas affected by Typhoon Haiyan that devastated the Philippines in November 2013. She\u2019s one of those hardworking people who were able to \u201cbuild back better\u201d her business.

She is positive that she will have a good return on her investment, and that her earnings will be a great help to cover their daily sustenance and send her child to college.

She hopes to earn the resources required to satisfy her basic needs.\r\n\r\nOlga's a hardworking, energetic, and enterprising woman.  She's requesting the loan to help her invest in fixed assets (chairs, a tent) and ingredients to make the dishes (cold cuts, oil, arepas, plantains, soda) to have a variety of products available to satisfy the tastes of all her customers.

That\u2019s why she decided to join Ruma. She feels happy as well because ever since she joined Ruma, she can give more contribution to her community. Her community sees Tutyati as a friendly, trusted, and informative mobile service provider. <br \/><br \/>As the business grows, Tutyati needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits to her community, so her community can have access to stay connected with their loved ones, no matter how far they are apart. <br \/><br \/>Tutyati\u2019s goal towards Ruma in the near future is to serve as an e-commerce business for her community, with Ruma\u2019s latest product called Mapan.

She is about 49 years old and living with her small family, her husband and two children. \r\n\r\nSatyabhama has been engaged in the tailoring occupation in her own home of Bhabanipatna for the last ten years. Her husband is also helping her to promote the business. Through the concerned business, she earns a monthly income of 7,500 INR. \r\n\r\nHer opinion is that from this small income it is very difficult to maintain her family, and after that, to get sufficient surplus to reinvest in the business is practically impossible. So she formed a group for strengthening social relations and to avail a loan for the expansion of her business.\r\n\r\nShe planned to purchase a quantity of tailoring raw materials and another tailoring machine from the local market. She hopes to get more and more profit from her business expansion and save money for construction of a house and to provide better education to her children.\r\n\r\nThe other 11 members of the group are also smart at their professions and also actively engaged with differ professions like vegetable vending, milk business, popped rice business, paddy growing, general store, and transport business. With this loan, they hope to boost their livelihoods. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1895200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a quantity of tailoring raw materials and another tailoring machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhawanipatna,Kalahandi,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2015-06-04T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-04T22:20:03Z","loan_amount":3400,"lender_count":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Satyabhama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binodini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jyoshna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pankajini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pareswari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarojini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damayanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramadevi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tuni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":216000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":216000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-06-09T06:35:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":895475,"name":"Hue's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hue, born in 1985, is a Thai ethnic woman.

He is a peace-loving man with a very big heart.  He is also a faithful husband and the father of three children.  His sons are currently working in the Russian Federation.  His daughter is a homemaker; she helps her mom with her work.\r\n\r\nJurakul owns a plot of land on which he grows vegetables and other crops.  Agriculture is his only source of income.  He has many dreams and he hopes to do well with everything.  At the moment, he is busy planting toward the summer harvest.  Since the summer and the fall last a long time in Tajikistan (and the weather is actually warm until December), Jurakul has a chance to get a good crop harvest.  However, he doesn't have the necessary resources to buy mineral fertilizers to prepare his land.  For this reason, he has requested a loan.

She has two daughters, ages eight months and five years old.  Her business is the transportation of construction materials.  She is a good mother.  She is independent, enterprising, generous, patient, steadfast, responsible, and very hard-working.  She conducts her business on the Kalajahuira River (river of rocks) and the Chuquiaguillo River, which are located northeast of the city.
