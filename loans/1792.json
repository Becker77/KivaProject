He is reliable, independent, responsible and very hard-working.\r\n\r\nHe runs his business from the entrance to the '23 de marzo' area, which lies next to the city El Alto.

Spanish is also the language he uses in business.\r\n\r\nHe lives with his wife who also works in the same thing. They live in a house which belongs to the family. It is made of bricks and has a corrugated metal roof and a wooden floor. It has a fresh water supply, electricity, gas and a drain system.\r\n\r\nTo earn a living he makes men's suits and the inner part of a traditional Bolivian skirts.

The inner part of the skirts are called 'enaguas' and are used in the traditional dress to go under the skirts to protect against the cold.\r\n\r\nHe started in this line of work when he was very young and now he works together with his wife. Their aim is to make traditional dresses for the dancers who are involved in the Carnival in Oruro. \r\n\r\nThe main benefit of this business is that he can sell to a group of 30 dancers, both men and women.

She accepted the challenge and her life changed for the better three years ago, since she started to receive an income for her family.\r\n\r\nShe is the mother of an eight-year-old son. She shares with him all the time he needs to grow up. Her job allows her to take care of the household chores. She works every day from 10:00 am until 10:00 pm. She visits her customers and offers them blouses, dresses, pants, jeans, skirts, shoes and accessories.\r\n\r\nShe applied for a CrediKiva because she offers her customers special credit terms and lacks enough capital to fulfill all her orders of clothes, perfumes, shoes and accessories. This is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. This investment will help her to keep her stock levels in good shape and respond to the customers\u2019 demands.

As such she anticipates that an additional Fresh Life facility will ensure her customers and community have better access to toilets by eliminating recurrent queues as they await to use the Fresh Life facilities.\r\n\r\nLeah is therefore seeking financial assistance towards the achievement of this goal; acquiring one Fresh Life Toilet."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":216.68,"image":{"id":1895486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Waste Management","sector":"Services","themes":["Water and Sanitation","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To pay for one Fresh Life Toilet.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kwa Reuben, Nairobi.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":258,"posted_date":"2015-06-05T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-05T15:20:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T16:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5286.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681518728},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5286.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696724664},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T18:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5286.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711656205},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5286.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752248683}],"funded_date":"2015-06-06T04:47:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":895737,"name":"Nelson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nelson is 22 years old and he supports one family member. \r\n\r\nHe has a motorcycle transport business and he will be using the loan to buy spare parts to repair and service his motorcycle and keep it in good condition.

From Toto, a 20 minute shuttle ride will take you high up to a rural area where monthly meetings of the amiable group \u201cChuipachaj\u201d take place.\r\n\r\nAmong the 10 women of the trust bank is entrepreneur Maria, she is a charismatic and dedicated member who, due to her well-spoken ability, has been elected as \u201cChuipachaj\u2019s\u201d treasurer. The 23-year-old mother of two has been with Friendship Bridge for just over three years and recounted the incredible impact the organization has had on her and her family. Before Friendship Bridge, Maria was unemployed and sharing the stresses of financing both food and education with her husband who lives and works in another country. With the loan she took out from Friendship Bridge, Maria shares that she was able to kick-start her weaving business and start generating enough revenue to feed and educate her children. With the new loan she will receive, Maria hopes to invest the money into new weaving equipment and materials so that she can continue supporting her family with the help of her supportive husband.  She is always looking for a better future of her family. \r\n\r\nMaria\u2019s calm and determined demeanor along with her success allows for a beautifully inspiring story that can be seen throughout Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nBesides the loan, Maria will also receive non-formal education as part of the Friendship Bridge Microcredit Plus program, which combine microloans and education. So, Maria will grow both as an entrepreneur and also increase her knowledge on topics like health, business, family and specific topics about women.\r\n\r\nThe trust bank Chuipachaj appreciates the confidence of KIVA investors around the world for giving them the opportunity to pursue development for their small businesses through microcredit.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1226.4,"image":{"id":1895648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To purchase weaving equipment and materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Totonicapan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -91.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-06-05T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-05T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":3675,"lender_count":144,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe Lorenza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rufina Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Isabel  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Paula  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta Isabel  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina Antonieta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":3675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2336},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2336},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2336},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2336},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2336},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2336},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2336},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2336},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2336},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2336},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2336},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2304}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.6},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.6},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.6},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.6},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.6},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.6},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":306.6,"local_amount":2336,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2350.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696557491},{"amount":306.6,"local_amount":2336,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2350.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711472451},{"amount":306.6,"local_amount":2336,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2350.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730991537},{"amount":306.6,"local_amount":2336,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2350.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752079806}],"funded_date":"2015-06-09T18:04:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":895865,"name":"Las Palomitas Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The eleven women who compose the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Palomitas\u201d share the common goal of moving themselves, their families and their community of Estanzuela in Quiche\u201d into a brighter and more prosperous future.

They are highly motivated to create new and workable solutions to poverty, to see their children in school and step into a brighter future.\r\n\r\nMatias is the 60-year-old president of the group.  She raises animals like chickens and also buys and sells beans.  She has six children and her children help her with the businesses. Two of them are street vendors in the capital of the country, Guatemala City. Mother and children work together to benefit  the entire family.  With her new loan, Matias plans to purchase three dozen chickens as well as sacks of beans to sell, not only in her community but also nearby as well.\r\n\r\nAll the ladies in the Trust Bank look forward to their monthly meetings. They transact business on their loans and then participate in educational training in their own native language given by a Facilitator of Friendship Bridge. Topics covered include health, hygiene and nutrition as well as self-esteem, women\u2019s rights and teenage pregnancy.\r\n\r\nKIVA investors are valuable partners in the \u2018Microcredit Plus\u201d Program of Friendship Bridge.

She has been employed in a garment factory in Cavite for nine years through the help of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative.*\n\nVilma works as a clothing packer. She ensures that items of clothing are packed properly and are ready for distribution. The type of packaging used depends on the type, value, fabric, and destination of the garments. One of the main concerns of factory employees is how to meet the needs of their family. With the increasing cost of living, their monthly salary is not enough to adequately provide for their families. This forced Vilma to borrow from money lenders who charged very high interest rates and who require her to surrender her ATM (her salary is credited to her ATM) as her loan collateral. These low-income employees sadly have no access to bank loans. \n\nFor this reason, Vilma is asking for your assistance to prevent her from submitting to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying them, since the loan payment is deducted every payday. She will greatly appreciate your positive response to her request to enable her pay her monthly obligations of her house and help her recover her ATM, to avoid being exploited by loan sharks. \n\nVilma meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work.\n\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\n\n** CCT staff and volunteers conduct weekly fellowship meetings for the factory workers before their work routine to do Bible readings, prayer and discipleship sessions to encourage and inspire them to do their best in life.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1887978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay for her house obligation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-05T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-05T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2995.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314429},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1497.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523126},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1497.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433555},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:33:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1497.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954499},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.3,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1497.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044469}],"funded_date":"2015-06-07T12:23:11Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":895919,"name":"Elpedia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elpedia is married and the mother of six children.

When she evaluated that it required a small investment to start this business and sales where good, she did not hesitate in launching this challenge.\r\n\r\nShe makes her purchases in the wholesale center of the city, stocks her cart in her house, then goes outside of the transportation terminal where she sells from.\r\n\r\nShe does this every day from 3 p.m. until 11 p.m. This is an ample schedule so that travelers and workers can try her fruits and healthy beverages.  Nancy applied for a credikiva, this is the first loan request she makes to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy a table where she can better prepare her fruits and to buy fruits in bulk to stock her business. \r\n\r\nShe is a mother of three children and wants to provide for them better living conditions and buy them a home. Her great challenge has been to recuperate from a burglary that happened where she lives when they stole all her merchandise. However, she started again with a lot of hope to succeed.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":144.39,"image":{"id":1888473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to buy a table where she can work and fruits in bulk to stock her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-06-05T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-05T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":63032},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":72123},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":74287},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":76515},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":78811},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":81175},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83610},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":86119},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":88702},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":91363},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":94104},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96927},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":99835},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":113397}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.09},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.16},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.25},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.37},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.52},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.95,"local_amount":63032,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":63161.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681350601},{"amount":26.65,"local_amount":72123,"processed_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":72271.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.9,"payment_id":696560859},{"amount":27.06,"local_amount":74287,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:47:39Z","rounded_local_amount":74439.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.34,"payment_id":711475586},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":76515,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":76672.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.25,"payment_id":730994450},{"amount":28.25,"local_amount":78811,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:23:05Z","rounded_local_amount":78973.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.95,"payment_id":752082414}],"funded_date":"2015-06-18T03:36:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":892031,"name":"Wabimanya Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\nTadeo is a 21-year-old Ugandan; he is married and has three children with two of them attending school.

People make their living in different activities, for example making espadrilles, selling all types of grains, agriculture, and animal husbandry.  <br \/><br \/>His wife has worked as a secretary for a lawyer in the city of Otavalo for several months.  Since she is the one who currently supports the home financially, John wants to help.  That is why he decided to start a business selling CDs. <br \/><br \/>They are going to use the loan to buy a CD burner, blank CDs, covers, and cases.  They already have experience in the business, since a few months ago they had a CD store in the city of Otavalo and later in San Antonio, that they had to close due to a lack of time to tend to them.  But now John will be 100% in charge of the business.<br \/><br \/>From his previous business, he still has CDs for sale, display cases, and a CD burner that doesn't work very well, which is why they want to invest in a new one.  John is grateful to Kiva for the help."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1891891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Movie Tapes & DVDs","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to launch his movie and DVD business, and with the income, begin a better lifestyle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Atuntaqui","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2015-06-05T19:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-05T19:00:06Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1656.44,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75.27},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":79.07},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":77.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":88.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":88.47},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":90.34},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":93.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":94.22},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.21},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":98.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100.69},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":102.46},{"due_date":"2016-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":104.63},{"due_date":"2016-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":106.69},{"due_date":"2016-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":109.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.91},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.46},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.35},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.53},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.28},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.29},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.78},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.82},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.61},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.8},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.88},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deepa R.","image":null}},{"id":889981,"name":"Korn's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A 43-year-old-mother of seven children, living in Kampong Cham province, Korn has been a rice and cassava farmer for twenty-five years.

With this business, she is currently earning INR 3,000. But she wants to earn more to support her children's education. Hence she came up with the idea to avail a loan to expand her business. \n\nShe got together with four other women who share similar interests. The other women are determined to help their families and want to expand their existing businesses in tailoring, garment retail and vegetable-selling. Together the group seeks a loan of INR 72,000.

She is a member of a group of 16 farmers registered with myAgro, who live and work in the village of Faraba (SID), located south-east of Bamako, Mali. Nagnouma is 50 years old and the mother of seven children whose ages range between 20 and 30.  Four of her children currently attend school.  Nagnouma's favorite saying is: \"Words stay after people have left\".\n\nThe family tradition is anchored in agricultural practice, an activity which constitutes the main source of income and provides food self-sufficiency for the family. For this reason, Nagnouma decided to become a farmer. She believes that self-knowledge is the best knowledge.  She grows groundnut and rice on her plot of land. As a farmer, however, she faces challenges such as the lack of farming tools and high-quality seeds, as well as the lack of labor. Nagnouma is starting her first year with myAgro. She decided to join because of the payment system, the high-quality seeds and the technical farming training.  This year, she will be making payments to purchase a myAgro package of OPV (open-pollinated variety) seeds and fertilizers to grow groundnut in order to increase her yield on her 0.0625 hectare plot of land.\n\nNagnouma has been growing groundnut for 45 years now for its nutritional value, since groundnut can be readily consumed by the family and is used as an ingredient in staple sauces, and also for its commercial value, since she sells groundnut at the market.

She has three sons who are 2, 3, and 4 years old, and 2 daughters who are 14 and 18 years old. Her business is making vases. \n\nShe is a good mother, independent, generous, patient, optimistic, responsible and very hardworking. She carries out her business as a street vendor in different exhibitions and markets of the city, which is well-known for being located at an altitude of approximately 4000 meters above sea level, with a dry, cold climate and temperatures varying during the day between -1 and 16 degrees Celsius.\n\nRosario is of dark complexion, with brown eyes, and long black hair which she ties behind her neck. She is of short stature and thin physique. Her mother tongue is Aymara, which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish generally and for activities that she does. She shares her life with her partner who works in commerce and with her children. Her older daughters study in school and her young sons have not reached schooling age. They live in a rented room made from brick and cement with a tin roof and wooden floor that has water, electricity and sewage lines. \n\nHer business is the production of cases from recycled soda bottles. The process she follows is: to cut the glass bottle with alcohol, sand the edges and make an outline for the case. \"We clean the bottles well and leave them to dry in a clean place, and sell them in cemeteries and to flower vendors...,\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she works with recycled material. The disadvantage is the remoteness of the places to which her goods must be transported. Her dream is to increase her production by employing labor. She desires to be able to buy bottles wholesale. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 8 years that she has carried out this activity.\n\nIt is for these reasons that Rosario applies for a loan to buy bottles wholesale in order to increase her production and hire labor.\n\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250.54,"image":{"id":1889781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy bottles wholesale in order to increase production and hire labor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-05T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-05T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":242.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":351.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":360.64},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":376.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":387.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":419.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":432.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":444.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":469.76},{"due_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":491.87},{"due_date":"2016-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":507.73},{"due_date":"2016-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":515.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.03},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.71},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.12},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.32},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.62},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.19,"local_amount":594.37,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":594.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554802},{"amount":52.35,"local_amount":361.02,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":361.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468889},{"amount":54.66,"local_amount":376.99,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":377.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296722},{"amount":57.34,"local_amount":395.42,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:35Z","rounded_local_amount":395.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076888}],"funded_date":"2015-07-01T18:20:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Verna Krishnamurthy","image":1691630}},{"id":886496,"name":"Marciano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"His name is Marciano, 35, resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. Married to Maricar, an OFW, and they have two children who are still in the Elementary level in school. He works hard to provide for his family.\r\n\r\nMarciano owns and operates his own transport jeepney service. He has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) of jeepney. Jeepneys are the most common form and cheapest means of public transport. They are one of the remnants of the American military presence in the Philippines during the second World War. The Filipinos being creative saw a real transportation means by making these jeeps about two meters longer and by putting two long seats on each side from the front to the back. Since then, jeepneys have been used as small buses for cheap transport of people, goods, and even sometimes little animals. \r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of him business, Marciano is requesting a PHP 20000 loan which he will use for the maintenance and renewal of registration of his jeepney. It is very important that his unit is always in a good running condition to ensure efficient service. He is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given him for it will surely cover his family's everyday needs and fund his children's schooling.\r\n\r\nMarciano aims to buy another jeepney unit. He wants his children to have a college education to allow them better opportunities in life.  He prays for his and his passengers' safety in all of their trips.

BRAC Pakistan has shown him a beam of hope in the darkness; he would be thankful got Kiva\u2019s cooperation. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":566.4,"image":{"id":1890547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to enhance his iron sales business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2015-06-05T23:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-05T23:20:05Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramzan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10866},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":11183},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":11510},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11847},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12193},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":12549},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":12916},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":13294},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":13682},{"due_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":14082},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":14494},{"due_date":"2016-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":11384}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.85},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.18},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.9},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.54},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.47},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.52},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.85,"local_amount":10866,"processed_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10887.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681299470},{"amount":109.97,"local_amount":11183,"processed_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-24T12:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":11204.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":698260156},{"amount":113.18,"local_amount":11510,"processed_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":11532.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711418712},{"amount":116.5,"local_amount":11847,"processed_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":11870.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731222998},{"amount":119.9,"local_amount":12193,"processed_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-20T13:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":12216.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":753602249}],"funded_date":"2015-06-26T09:11:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":893144,"name":"Lightin Luis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lightin trabajo durante a\u00f1os en un taller de confecciones, tras la b\u00fasqueda de nuevos horizontes e ingresos para su familia, en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su c\u00f3nyuge iniciaron una venta de comidas t\u00edpicas de la Costa Caribe Colombiana.

Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks with her family, but she uses Spanish in general and for her business.\r\n\r\nThe traditional meals Maria sells include aji de panza (spicy cow's stomach with onion and tomato with rice), rice with cheese (rice, milk and cheese), stuffed peppers (peppers, chopped meat, onion), peanut soup, and others. She works every day of the week going through the streets with her food cart. \"I cook in my house and I sell it from my cart. The climate here causes food to spoil quickly...\" she states. The advantage of her business is that she has daily customers, and the disadvantage is the lack of funds to buy a refrigerator to keep her food. Her dream is to open a typical food restaurant. She wants to expand her business by buying a refrigerator. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan cycle with the institution in the two years she has had her business. These are the reasons why Maria is asking for a loan - to buy a refrigerator to store the food, and to open a restaurant."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":366.27,"image":{"id":1891906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

","en":"Jorge is a very hard-working man. He is married and lives with his wife, with whom he has three children. They live in the Saloya Alto precinct, ten minutes from the San Miguel de los Bancos canton, which is located in the northwest of the province of Pichincha. Its people are very hard-working and united.\r\n\r\nDon Jorge comes from a family of low economic resources. This is why he was not able to finish his secondary schooling. In spite of this, he decided to get ahead and began to work as a day laborer at a ranch in the district.  Now he has the support of his bosses, and he is their right-hand man. At the ranch, he does the work of milking the dairy cattle, and he also trains the thoroughbred horses for public events. He lives in a little house of wood provided by his boss, in which he and his family seek to get ahead for the well-being of all of them. His wife, who is his partner and constant supporter, works with him on the same ranch performing cleaning activities and caring for gardens.\r\n\r\nThe business that he will undertake is raising chickens. He has some experience in this activity, since it is work that he has done in past years on his own initiative but in minimal quantities. He will build a shed with local materials. He and his wife will work an average of five hours a day, since they need to clean and be alert to keeping all the birds in good conditions, since they are high-maintenance animals.\r\n\r\nDon Jorge has many dreams to accomplish. One of them is to have his own business and work by himself at this activity so that he can spend more time with his family.\r\n\r\nThis loan will help Don Jorge to improve his quality of life and give a better future to his family, who are his reason for striving every day.

She is married and has one small child. Shahodat lives with her husband, child and mother-in-law. She has been doing agricultural work for many years. While young, she is already an experienced farmer. Shahodat raises farm animals, mainly cattle, in her backyard.

She began offering body lotions, shampoo, cologne, face masks and deodorants to her neighbors through specialized catalogs from her home in a display case. On the weekends, from her home's terrace, she sells delicious kebabs to the residents of the area. Now her income is insufficient and she is applying for her first Credikiva through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy cologne, powders, perfume, and lotions to meet her client's orders and to invest in beef, chicken and sausage to make the kebabs. She is the mother of a six year old girl who she devotes a lot of time and attention to so that she grows up comfortably. Her personal goal is to continue supporting her family and her business goal is to have a store.
