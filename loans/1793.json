She is 19 years old. She lives in a wooden pile house with her sister, her brother and her parents. Her family owns one hectare of rice fields and one pig. In May 2014, she left her work in the fields and decided to be trained by Soieries du M\u00e9kong, a social enterprise that fights against rural exodus and for empowerment of women by training them and offering them sustainable work in the village.

His regular customers are his neighbors and his local community. To help him continue with his business, he would like to apply for a 10,000 PHP loan through CCT and Kiva, which he will use to buy more of the ingredients needed for his bakery. He thanks God and you for your good heart and the financial help as it will surely allow the couple to cover their daily needs.\r\n\r\nWilfredo hopes to serve more customers.

This will enable her to create more employment opportunities, and as a result, improve her quality of life and that of the other people who have influence at her work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":95.58,"image":{"id":1891998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to perform maintenance on her sewing machines, and fix her work chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Itagui","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2015-06-06T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-06T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.06,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Ofelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.63,"local_amount":55714,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":57308.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681375241},{"amount":22.13,"local_amount":58736,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-21T12:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":60417.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.73,"payment_id":697633247},{"amount":23.34,"local_amount":59918,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:21:18Z","rounded_local_amount":61633.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1,"payment_id":731020231},{"amount":22.42,"local_amount":60913,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":62656.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.33,"payment_id":752108396}],"funded_date":"2015-06-19T12:37:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christopher Redmond","image":null}},{"id":896196,"name":"Parveen's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Parveen is age 43; she is the mother of three children.

","en":"Saboat is 45 and lives in a city called Sarband. She has a small family. Her husband is working abroad and she has been working sewing women's clothing in the traditional style for several years. She also does embroidery on some of the dresses she makes. In a month she can sew up to 20 dresses. She does very well in her work and her number of customers is gradually growing. \r\n\r\nSaboat is looking for a loan because she needs to get a new sewing machine. Her current one isn't working anymore after many years of service. A new sewing machine is quite expensive so to buy one she needs some money.

He is married and the happy father of two children. Jurabek studied to be an engineer, but after finishing his education he was not able to find work. At 19 he was already married, and understood that he didn't have the time to look for a job as he would soon have a child. Therefore he decided to work with livestock breeding. He started with two cows and five rams. \r\n\r\nJurabek currently  has a herd of more than 15 rams and five cows. His business is going well. He breeds the rams and sells them. His wife helps him with his business. She feeds the cattle, washes and milks the cows. Even if Jurabek could not work with his profession, he does not feel sad about his life, even if he has a tough time as the only breadwinner in the family. \r\n\r\nCurrently Jurabek would like to purchase livestock feed, but he does not have the full amount of money needed. Therefore he turned to MDO Arvand for a financial support. Jurabek hopes for help and support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1894601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kairaqum","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-06-06T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-06T20:00:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jurabek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":369.03},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":398.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":405.06},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":421.35},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":441.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":450.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":472.19},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":499.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":541.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.82},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.47},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.73},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.27},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.73},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.23},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-01T12:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4068.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696605116}],"funded_date":"2015-07-06T18:24:01Z","paid_date":"2015-09-01T12:11:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":896037,"name":"Gulgaky","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0413\u0443\u043b\u0433\u0430\u043a\u044b, 42 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c 5 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0433\u0430\u043a\u044b -

She is married and the mother of two children. Shahodat grew up in a kishlak settlement. After finishing school she got married. Her husband is a builder. The first period everything went well, but soon after Shahodat gave birth to their first child, it became difficult to feed the family. Therefore Shahodat decided to start working with livestock breeding, specifically animal sales. \r\n\r\nCurrently Shahodat has five cows in her herd. She is on her feet from four in the morning, milking the cows and bringing the milk to the market. Shahodat's business is going well and she does not complain. \r\n\r\nNot long ago Shahodat sold a cow, and for the revenue from this she would like to purchase two calves and livestock feed. However she does not have enough money. Therefore she turned to MDO Arvand to get a loan. Shahodat hopes for help.

She expanded her turnover and income step by step. Currently the income from the store is the main source of income for her family. Zainura's husband works as a taxi driver and has his own vehicle. He spends all his income on the family and only thanks to his wife they are able to provide for it. \r\n\r\nNot long ago, Zainura renovated her house which increased the family's expenses. Currently Zainura is experiencing financial problems and she does not have enough money to purchase goods for the store. Due to this problem she decided to turn to MDO Arvand for support.

Step by step he increased the number of livestock and started to get a higher income. as he was not able to get an education himself, he decided that his children should get the opportunity to get a valuable education and he would do everything to make this happen. \r\n\r\nCurrently Shavkatjon's business is experiencing hard times due to a decrease in the price of cattle.

With the loan from Kiva, she would like to pay the workers who harvested her maize. The profits from the business will be used to improve their welfare and to pay school fees of her children.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She does her work in the \u2018urbanizaci\u00f3n mariscal Santa Cruz\u2019 area, located to the north of the city and inhabited by Aymar\u00e1 migrants coming from the countryside who work in trade and as laborers. It has a cold and dry climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 0-12 degrees centigrade. \r\n\r\nElizabeth has dark skin, dark eyes, long brown hair, is of average height, average build, her native language is Aymar\u00e1, which is spoken in that area, and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for the business she does. She shares her life with her daughter who goes to school. They live in a house she owns, made of adobe, brick and cement with a roof of metal sheeting and a wooden floor, which has drinking water, electricity and sewer service. Previously, she worked selling natural health products; she changed her field and currently sells blankets and bedspreads, very sell-able products due to the cold in the area. \"I always sold as a street vendor, now I sell at the early morning fair in bulk...\" she says. The early morning fair begins at 5 in the morning and is characterized by bulk sales at better prices. The advantage of her business is that due to the cold in the area, the sales are constant. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to make her purchases in bulk. Her dream is to stabilize her business. She wants to purchase blankets and bedspreads in bulk to offer during the winter. This is her third loan cycle with the institution in the 5 years she has been doing this work. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Elizabeth asks for a loan to purchase blankets and bedspreads in bulk to improve her sales and stabilize her business.

Thanks to Kyzzhibek's hard work, today she has eight cows, five horses, and fifty sheep. She grows nuts and plums for sale on a plot of land. Her monthly income is about 10,500 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Kyzzhibek has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy ten sheep to increase the size of her herd.

The profits from the business will be used to pay school fees of his children and to buy a piece of land.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Kholmoh would wait for her husband to send her money each month, but then she stopped waiting for his funds and began opening her own business. Now Kholmoh is engaged in agricultural activities. She looks after the children, runs the household, and simultaneously rears animals. Kholmoh manages to do everything. She looks after the domestic livestock alone.

Though finding work in the village is very difficult, one has to support one's family and care for one's children, therefore she has been working in agriculture for many years. She currently has 13 cows and 27 sheep on her farm as well as 2.4 hectares of land where she grows clover for sale. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Elmira has approached Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 KGS to purchase livestock.
