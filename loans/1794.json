One of their children is currently receiving an education. Kadidiatou's hopes and dreams are to satisfy her children's educational needs and to purchase animals for her children's future. She only attended seven years of school because she had to work to help support her family. She has turned to RMCR because she is poverty-stricken and destitute. She purchases seeds at different markets and sells the produce in these same places. By growing peanuts, and when there is an abundance of rain, she'll be able to harvest many kilos of crops.

Yaya is from Mali. He didn't receive an education growing up. He is a 36-year-old married father to nine children, aged between four months and 12 years old. Three of his children are currently receiving an education. His partner is a housewife. Yaya raises rams. He is taking out this loan with RMCR in order to purchase many rams. He gets his livestock from the local markets and resells them at further-flung markets. He has 12 years of experience in this field. Through selling his livestock, he earns an average profit of 15,000 FCFA per ram. With these profits, Yaya will be able to meet his family's needs (clothing, health costs, food costs). He often has to deal with increased transportation costs, but he generally organises his trips along with other local livestock farmers in order to work around this. In the future, Yaya would like a larger loan in order to further develop his business and earn larger profits so he can purchase a plot of land in his village and use it to build a family home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1894588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rams for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Yangasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":438,"posted_date":"2015-06-07T18:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-07T18:10:07Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brahima","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assana","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaya","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1050000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-07-03T02:17:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christopher Smith","image":null}},{"id":896697,"name":"Mirvat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mirvat is a 49-year-old married mother of two children, who has been working as a tailor from her house for the past 18 years.

With limited resources, she created her own productive clothing shop. This start-up now allows her the possibility to earn a living, helping her see that starting a business without lots of capital is possible. Six years ago Marlin started to sew for neighbors and friends using just her home sewing machine and her own dedication. Approximately one year ago, a friend suggested she join an association and venture into producing Bermuda shorts and jeans to sell in bulk to shops in Sincelejo, Corozal, Monter\u00eda, and other cities along the Caribbean cost of Colombia. The level of success was greater than expected and she now aspires to create a larger business. For this reason, she is applying for her first Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. It will allow her to invest in fabric, thread, and supplies to increase her production and enlarge her market.

He is a Palestinian refugee who has worked hard for 26 years as a car mechanic to provide his family with the necessary standards of living, and to make sure they can benefit from a shining future. One that is better than what he experienced during his time as a child, teenager and developing his business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Mohamad established his current garage where he welcomes his customers in a very special way and makes sure that they get what they need in a very short period of time. Since technology and cars are developing quickly, Mohamad is working hard to stay up to date with every new released car, and related technology. \r\n\r\nHis family responsibilities, especially his children's school expenses, limit his ambitions. Nevertheless, his faith in an acquired loan from Kiva's Field Partner Al Mjamoua brought to him a dream come true.

She works two days a week for two to three hours a day.  She offers her products on credit and collects every eight days.  She has done this work for five years and it is going very well.

There, she sells fried dishes and hornado (traditional Ecuadorian dishes with pork).  She works on the weekends from 11:00 am to 3:00 pm or until she runs out of prepared food.  Her customers prefer her because of the seasoning she puts in the dishes that make them special. When she is free, she helps her spouse selling coconuts.\r\n\r\nShe is going to use this loan to buy pork and coconuts.

He has secured space and is requesting a loan to buy office furniture; specifically one table and 3 executive chairs, as well as two computers and to install a CCTV system. \r\n\r\nSamuel hopes to have 2 more branches around Johannesburg employing at least 10 people within the next 3 years. He is ambitious, calculative and hardworking and is a firm believer in financial literacy as a way out of poverty among disadvantaged communities."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1897067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy office furniture, two computers and a CCTV system.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Observatory, Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":445,"posted_date":"2015-06-08T11:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-08T11:40:08Z","loan_amount":2450,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZAR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2017-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2017-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.12},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.12},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.11},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.11},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.11},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.11},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.11},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.11},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.11},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.11},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.11},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.11},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.11},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.11},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-06-18T16:56:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":896897,"name":"Adil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adil is 41 years old and is married with a child.

She has a secondary education. She grows crops and rears animals as the main source of income for her family, having started in 2000. Thanks to Raziyahan's dedication, ambition and hard work, today she has five cows, twenty sheep and a 1.26 hectare plot of land where she grows clover. The monthly income from the business is about 25,000 som (KGS). Raziyahan has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 130,000 som (KGS) to buy fertilizer to treat her land and to buy a cow.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.

Also, her husband is a farmer. \r\n\r\nWith the loan from Kiva, she would like to buy more cows for rearing. The profits from the business will be used to increase her savings, to pay the school fees of her children, and to buy medical insurance.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He decided to purchase a biodigester in order to displace LP gas and wood, two expensive and unsustainable inputs that used to be vital for his farm's operations.
