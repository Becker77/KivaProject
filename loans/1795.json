He decided to acquire a Sistema Biobolsa biodigester in order to free himself from this financial burden and to become his own energy and fertilizer supplier. \r\n\r\nHe can do this by inputting his cows' manure in the biodigester, where bacteria will transform it into renewable energy and nutrient-rich fertilizer. Apolinar will use the biogas to cook and heat water, displacing wood and fossil-fuel-based LP gas in the house and kitchen, while replacing the chemical fertilizer by the organic one, nourishing the soils in a sustainable manner and increasing his crops' yield. \r\n\r\nHe looks forward to saving money, improving his productivity and living in a cleaner, more comfortable environment. As he starts saving money, he plans to improve the infrastructure on his farm to widen his cows' corral.\r\n\r\nThis loan represents 20% of the full cost of the biodigester. The remaining part is being covered by a government subsidy."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":458.55,"image":{"id":1897335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"to invest in a 16 m3 waste-to-energy biodigester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Libres","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":226,"posted_date":"2015-06-08T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-08T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Apolinar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8540,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":8540}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.71,"local_amount":1424,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-31T12:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1424.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681523133},{"amount":91.71,"local_amount":1424,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-22T12:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1424.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696728721},{"amount":183.42,"local_amount":2848,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:06:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2848.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731164632},{"amount":91.71,"local_amount":1424,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:22:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1424.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752252401}],"funded_date":"2015-06-12T01:18:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":896945,"name":"Husniyah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Husniyah is a 23-years-old married lady from Tubas, a village near Nablus city.

The members decided to use this name because it represented the place where they get the water that is fundamental for their homes.

Despite the not-very-high average education level, the inhabitants show a lot of warmth and respect to each other.\r\n\r\nWithin her group, Victoria is lovingly called Viki. She is reserved and peaceful, but with a great enterprising spirit. She is 29 years old and is married to Macario who works as a taxi driver. Together they have a family with three children; their twins are already in primary school. \r\n\r\nFour years ago, Viki opened a popscicle store, \"we began because my husband had to be in the US and with the money that he sent, we built three locations. All of them are being rented. We rent one of them to our brother-in-law who had the popscicle place but one day he left and left everything.\" So, Viki didn't let the opportunity pass her by and it gave her business continuity. With her savings, she purchased some liters of ice cream and popsicles. The work has been going well and now she also sells frozen things, and frozen yogurt is what the customers have requested. With the new loan, Viki will be able to stock her business with more ice cream, popsicles and yogurt. In the hot season, the sales improve, but in the winter when the sun doesn't come out, the business is practically dead.\r\n\r\n\"One of my dreams is to learn to make ice cream myself to stop buying it,\" said Viki although she knows that to make it, she will need a special machine, but she is sure that one day she will manage to surely have it.\r\n\r\n*The other group members are Juana, who will invest in a taxi, Maria Luciana in her grocery store, and Leticia, Victoria dn Mar\u00eda Albina in sheep.*\r\n\r\n*The photo was taken on the stairs below the kiosk.

The members  have known each other since childhood and are united by a strong friendship.\r\n\r\nMaria Guadalupe, known as Lupe, formed a family with Jose Guadalupe. They have eleven children, and four of them are still dependent on their parents. \r\n\r\nShe has raised animals for twenty five years, and chose to do it because in her community this is very simple work. \"I was able to help with the household expenses, there were many when the children were young\", she comments, \"plus I could stay close to them all the time\".\r\n\r\nLooking to increase her profits, she is feeding the animals special feed in addition to the grazing. She will use the loan to buy pigs and begin to raise them again.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful that her children have been able to continue with school, because without the loan assistance her children would possibly have  had to stop studying due to lack of resources. The single goal for Lupe is to expand her business and allow the children to become professionals.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members include Maria Francisca, Maria Asuncion, Maria, Gregoria, Guadalupe, Leticia y Epifania. They will invest in chickens and sheep. Additionally, they all specialize in embroidery work including tablecloths, napkins and more.\r\n\r\nThe photo above was taken on the steps of the municipal pavilion.

For 17 years, she has worked making napkins, table cloths, and other embroidered items, as well as raising and fattening chickens and sheep. She started her activities because she wanted to help with the household expenses and her children's education expenses.\r\nFor Martina, it hasn't been difficult having two businesses because she cares for the animals in the morning, and takes them to graze in the pasture.   At midday she spends more time moving them to a different place and feeding them again.  Doing the embroidery is what she spends the rest of her time on every day. It can take her up to 20 days to finish a piece. \r\nAt times, people from her community order different embroidered pieces to deliver for mementos of celebrations such as baptisms, first communions, confirmations, and weddings. \r\nMartina isn't worried about competition in her community because she already has regular customers and she always tries to do her work with the best quality so that they will keep recommending her.

The community where the family lives is of Mazahua origin.  It is very peaceful, and known for its landscapes of leafy green trees and its cool climate.

However, she lacks a vehicle for transporting the merchandise, so she would love to have a little truck, and thus stop paying for transport service.  Another of her dreams is to be able to improve her house, because it needs windows and stucco for the walls. With the loan, she will be able to purchase products such as bread, eggs, milk, soft drinks, and canned products, which are the products most in demand.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Francisca, Leticia S., Virginia, Marcela, Paula, and Leticia D. and Teresa, who will purchase sheep. \r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken in the plaza of the town pavilion.

Esa actividad complementaria va avanzando bien pues al d\u00eda llegan a vender hasta 45 cuartillos de ma\u00edz (cada cuartillo equivale 1.5 kg). Uno de los sue\u00f1os de Tere es abrir varias sucursales de tortiller\u00eda en su comunidad para terminar de construir su y casa y mejorar su calidad de vida. \n   Las integrantes del grupo son Rachel quien invierte en trastes y colchas; Cecilia, en tortiller\u00eda; Rufina, en su est\u00e9tica; M\u00f3nica, en frutas y verduras; Liliana, en colchas y Ang\u00e9lica, en zapatos y colchas.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en la casa de Cecilia, en la imagen aparecen utensilios y algunas materias primas de Tere con las que elabora los postres, Tere viste sudadera blanca*","en":"This group's name \"Chicas Emprendedoras\" [\"Enterprising Girls\"] perfectly describes its members, who work hard for the well-being of their families. The group members are all good friends, and they are requesting a loan from VisionFund to improve their businesses.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Teresa is affectionately nicknamed 'Tere'. She's a kind woman, who is always smiling, and is also known for her dedication to her work. Tere is married to Francisco, and has a beautiful family with three young children. \r\n\r\nShe has been making desserts, bread and cakes for the last five years. She worked as a maid in Mexico City for many years, and her employers taught her how to make all kinds of desserts. She sells her products from house to house, and, thanks to the delicious flavors, she often receives special requests, for example her famous orange bread, which is famous among her neighbors. Tere, visibly moved, describes one of her best sales days, recounting that \"the 10th of May, Mother's Day, was a great day, I earned well, and I received lots of orders for cakes\".\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy large cake pans, flour, eggs and milk, as well as corn, paper and firewood for the tortilla business which she runs with her mother, Cecilia, who is also a member of the group. The tortilla business is doing very well, and they can sell as many as 45 cuartillos (a cuartillo is about 1.5kg) of corn in a day. One of Tere's dreams is to open several branches of the tortilla business in her district, and earn enough to finish building her house and improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nOther members of the group are: Rachel, who wants to invest in dishes and blankets; Cecilia, in her tortilla business; Rufina, in beauty products; M\u00f3nica, in fruit and vegetables; Liliana, in blankets, and Ang\u00e9lica, in shoes and blankets.\r\n\r\n*The photo was taken in Cecilia's house. In the photo, you can see some of the utensils and ingredients that Tere uses for her desserts. Tere is wearing a white sweatshirt in the picture.

She herself comments, \"in my community, the calves grow very fast because you can feed them with corn, grass, and sacked pastures which you can find around here with no problem.\"  She acquires her animals when they are small, or in some cases, when they are half-grown, so that they can grow within less time and she can sell them sooner. \r\n\r\nWith the new opportunity of the loan, she will buy two calves and sufficient food. For this, she is always waiting on her supplier to find her the best quality product. In the same manner, Conchita always looks for the best buyer.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"Today I am a master artisan. But to be able to craft archaeological replicas, I had to work very hard. I was born on September 3, 1949 in San Juan de Oriente, Nicaragua. I work in ceramics and my specialty is pre-Hispanic replicas. My adventure in art began when I was just a boy and would watch my parents work. I always liked the original and beautiful pieces our ancestors left for us. So I learned ceramic work from my father and with a teacher in the city of Masaya. Today, I work alone with no assistants or students. I consider myself a respectable person, friendly and, above all, responsible. This wasn't always the case. As a youth, I was an alcoholic; I was irresponsible at work and at home. Thank God, my life changed in 1988 when I became a Christian and stopped drinking. After that, I was able to dedicate myself to my true calling \u2014 my art.\r\n\r\n\"From Nicaragua I send you my gratitude for the support and faith you are placing in me by way of this microcredit.

This is Paulina. She is already 61 years old now. Flinging herself into managing her current sari-sari store business, she is hopeful that in no time, she will be able to finally get her dream house and have more businesses as well. But as of now she is working persistently with her husband Carlos to provide for the daily needs of her household. \r\n\r\nA sari-sari store is often seen everywhere in the Philippines, most especially along the sidewalks and streets. It is most likely a convenience store, but quite a sort of smaller than the usual and offers only limited products which are commonly needed, such as toiletries, food, instants, beverages and other commodities. Unlike grocery stores, sari-sari stores offer products at low-cost and on a retail basis, which is really an advantage for the customers.\r\n\r\nMaking headway to improve her sales, Paulina would like to ask for help from you. She would like to borrow a loan of PHP 18,000 that she would use to purchase additional products and merchandise items for her store. With this, she expects to grow her sales and provide a better remedy for their family\u2019s daily living condition. And, today, you can be a big part of her life. \r\n\r\nShe meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She has a high school education and is retired. Her children help her with everything. It is very difficult to find work in the village, but at the same time, it is necessary to provide for her family. This is why Saliyahan has been farming for over 25 years. She currently has two cows and earns 15,000 som (KGS) per month, which is not enough money to live on. In order to develop her business, she applied for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) with Bai-Tushum Bank to buy cows to fatten and resell. She plans to use the earnings from the loan to invest in the future development of her business, which will allow her to improve her family's living conditions.

Just the power of \u201csikad\u201d or kick makes a trisikad run.  Simply put, it\u2019s a bicycle with attached compartment or section for passengers. Elizabeth is able to help unemployed, low-educated but hardworking men in their community by hiring them as trisikad drivers.\r\n\r\nElizabeth\u2019s experience during Haiyan further strengthens her resolve to improve her business. She humbly requests a PHP 15,000 loan to be used partly to buy additional materials for fishing nets, and partly to pay the downpayment for another unit of \u201ctrisikad. Furthermore, she plans to acquire another fishing boat in the near future. One of her dreams is that her children will manage a transportation business both in land and sea after finishing college. She\u2019s hoping that you would be an instrument to achieve her goals. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is a devoted member of CCT Credit Cooperative and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1897693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

Recently, her mother became unemployed and completely dependent upon Letricia due to a disability.

Letricia\u2019s credit history has been negatively affected due to medical bills associated with the death of a child. Letricia has been making strides toward paying on her balances owed, but the damage to her credit is done. She currently needs a new roof for her home, and has been unable to finance the project due to her credit score. Her roof is currently leaking in several places, including her children\u2019s bedroom. Letricia is concerned that her children may become sick due to the growth of mold in their damp ceiling. For this reason, Letricia is hoping that SELF and Kiva can help finance a new roof for her home, which will improve the living environment and make the home safe and healthy for Letricia and her

manufacturers, but it also showcases Filipinos\u2019 ingenuity and gives value to indigenous people\u2019s arts and culture. Teresita knows of its importance; that is why she chose to venture in this kind of business. She operates a store of native products located in one of the markets in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental. The store sells items created from coconut shells or husks, rattan, sea shells, bamboo, dried leaves and stems, woven ethnic threads, and many others. These hand-made objects are very attractive to foreigners and local tourists who usually visit the area.\r\n\r\nTeresita would like to add more selection of native products that will surely entice the buyers. She is in need of Php 25,000 additional capital to procure these. Hope you are willing to help her so she can increase her profit, sustain their everyday needs, and boost her savings.\r\n\r\nTeresita is married to Emilio, who is always supportive of her and her business. They have children and grandchildren to whom they want to bestow all their undertakings.

Comparable to bamboo trees, they are bent but not broken. They also gather strength through togetherness and camaraderie. This is the exact description of how Helen was able to recover and rehabilitate her business. \r\n\r\nShe is from Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, and she sells fresh and dried fish, fruits, and ready-to-wear clothes. Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013 resulted in the dwindling of her business, but she gradually restored it with the unwavering support of Jessen, her husband, and their children. Her co-fellowship* members at CCT Credit Cooperative also contributed a lot through their inspiring stories and Bible reflections.\r\n\r\nAs she continues to develop her business, she needs additional capital of 25,000 PHP to obtain more stock and increase her buying power in the approaching rainy season, when fish will be scarce and expensive. She aims to get a permanent space in the public market so customers can easily locate her. Due to her age, she can hardly transfer from one rented space to another. Your generous assistance will surely make her business prosper.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of a successful life and career for her children after finishing their college education. She wants to own a decent house for her whole family some day. \r\n\r\nHelen regularly meets with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":527.1,"image":{"id":1897770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

He is requesting a loan to pay for his tuition fees. This is his story: \n\nMy Name is Jeckson Luis. I was born in Bonao, in the province of Monse\u00f1or Nouel, and I live here with my parents and brothers. By the mercy of God, I had the opportunity to live and grow up in the city of my birth.\n\nAt the end of 2008, when I was in my first semester of my bachelor studies, the company in which my father works had to lay of people because of the situation they were in, all because of the falling currency and the production costs. My father was one of the laid off employees. Thanks to God, I was given the opportunity to finish my bachelor's degree in the school I was in because the company paid the majority of the monthly cost.\n\nAt the university of UAPA I decided to study clinical psychology and later changed to educational psychology because I had the strong wish to do social services. This came from my relationship with God, that I established during my bachelor studies and in many years as an acolyte in my church.\n\nWithout the help of Kiva, I would not be able to continue studying because we do not yet have the resources to do so.\n\nI have an interest in offering help with the primary vision of creating a positive space, where kids will have the opportunity to develop themselves in different areas like music, art, theater, manual crafts, cooking, motivational and self-esteem workshops, and so on. I do this because I am convinced that offering a favorable space for the development of children from a young age contributes significantly to the decisions they make in the morning on how to spend their time.\n\nAll of this will be tied to the work in the families, who are the ones that have the greatest influence on them. And by doing this from a young age, it is possible to form kids who have a different outlook and into people that are needed by society. I ask you to help me with fulfilling this vision and achieve my goal to be a great psychologist for the benefit of society."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1886441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is Fred. He is the Director of Totstop School, a mixed school in the rural area of Lusaka in Hoima with 90 students. Totstop School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. \r\n\r\nThe school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450-liter tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nTotstop School will repay its loan with its school fees, which it collects each term. Fred ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children who fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school.

This is Noeline. She is the Director of St. Jude & St. Christina Nursery & Primary Schools, mixed schools in the rural area of Kahoora in Hoima with a total of 1,000 students. St. Jude & St. Christina School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining two UV water filtration systems to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase two UV water treatment systems with 1,000 & 450 litre tanks, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nSt. Jude & St. Christina Schools will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Noeline ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1070,"image":{"id":1898045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Hoima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-06-09T06:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-09T06:10:03Z","loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":24.04,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"St. Jude & St. Christina School","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":8195000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1639000},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1639000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1639000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1639000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1639000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":535},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":535},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":535},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":535},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":535}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":510.96,"local_amount":1639000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1644357.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":24.04,"payment_id":696580904},{"amount":535,"local_amount":1639000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1644357.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755507223}],"funded_date":"2015-06-10T13:55:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":897576,"name":"Tabu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tabu is a married mother of five children, all of whom attend school.

This is Bening. He is the Director of Bumbaire Secondary School, a mixed school in the rural area of Bushenyi with 400 students. Bumbaire School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nBumbaire School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Bening ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1898051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Bushenyi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.416667 30.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-06-09T06:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-09T06:20:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.99,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bumbaire School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3035000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":191.01,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":614713.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.99,"payment_id":696580905},{"amount":200,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":614713.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755507224}],"funded_date":"2015-06-10T15:39:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":897591,"name":"Nani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nani is from the village of Vaziani, where she lives with her husband who is a private overseer of a residential building.

He is an illiterate Malian farmer who is 43 years old, married and the father of 6 children aged between 5 months and 13 years old, three of whom attend school. His spouse is a cleaner. Issa has been raising sheep for 6 years. He gets his supplies at the nearby markets and resells at the same markets, though he occasionally sends his animals to a market far away. The profits that he earns enable him to fulfill his family's needs.\r\n\r\nHe is borrowing money from RMCR in order to finance and expand his livestock business at an opportune moment. Having often encountered problems making sales at the market, Issa would like to be able to take his animals to the distant market himself, which is why he would like to have a higher loan in future

She has a secondary education.  By nature, she is very hardworking and she has a positive attitude toward life.

She makes a monthly income of 11,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her activity, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy calves and sheep.  She is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further increase her livestock headcount.
