Su negocio es la venta de telas para la confecci\u00f3n de polleras de cholita; Ella aprendi\u00f3 a confeccionar ropa de cholita, polleras, blusas y algunas mantas por el lapso de un a\u00f1o, luego abri\u00f3 un taller en su casa, con sus propios fondos y con el apoyo de su familia.  Su taller de costura est\u00e1 ocupado por una m\u00e1quina plisadora, una recta, dos peque\u00f1as mesas y sus fierros que le permiten un perfecto plisado de las t\u00edpicas polleras de cholita que se usan en la zona, \u201cnunca cre\u00ed en tan poco tiempo tendr\u00eda mi propio taller de costura y que realizar\u00eda trabajos para vender en otras ciudades\u2026\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que cuenta con ventas continuas, la desventaja es la falta de dinero para la compra de telas por mayor. Su sue\u00f1o es fabricar sus propias telas artesanalmente, ella desea realizar la compra de tela por mayor para cumplir con los pedidos pendientes para las pr\u00f3ximas festividades patronales. Esta es la 15 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 10 a\u00f1os que desarrolla esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Filomena solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de tela por mayor para cumplir con sus pedidos y fabricar sus propias telas\n","en":"Filomena is a 39 year old married woman with two sons aged 20 and 15 and a 10 year old daughter. Her business is selling fabric to make polleras (traditional skirts worn by indigenous women).<br \/><br \/>She is a good mother, a good listener, patient, supportive, responsible and hard-working. She does her business in the \u201816 de julio\u2019 area, a center located to the east of the city which has a large amount of administrative buildings, businesses and Social Service offices. It has a cold and dry climate with a daily temperature that varies between 0 to 12 degrees Celsius. <br \/><br \/>Filomena is dark-skinned, has dark eyes, long black hair that she braids, low in height, and robust in build. She uses traditional clothing (skirt, hat and shawl) Her mother tongue is Aymara which she speaks with her family and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and for her business. (She is seated in the photo in the center with a cream colored sweater and a red skirt). <br \/><br \/>She lives her life with her husband who works as a contract bricklayer and her children who study at school. They live in a rented room made out of brick and cement with a metal roof that has running water, electricity, gas and sewage. Her desire to get ahead led her to head a communal bank of people with businesses like: a sewing workshop, selling cosmetic products, making mattresses, selling jackets, making aprons, selling alpaca sweaters and selling skirts, who got together to request a loan and improve their businesses. <br \/><br \/>Her business is selling fabric to make traditional skirts (polleras) worn by indigenous women. She learned to sew traditional clothing skirts, blouses and some shawls for one year. Then she opened a shop in her house with her own funds and the support of her family. Her sewing workshop is filled with a pleating machine, an overlock machine, two small tables and her irons that allow her to make perfect pleats on the traditional skirt that is used in the area. \u201cI never thought that I would have my own workshop in such a short time and do work that is sold in other cities\u201d she commented. The advantage of her business is that it has constant sales. Her disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy fabric wholesale. <br \/><br \/>Her dream is to fabricate her own hand-made fabrics. She wants to buy fabric wholesale to fill outstanding orders for the upcoming saint Day festivities. This is her 15th loan with the institution in the 10 years she has been in business. For these reasons Filomena is requesting a loan to buy fabric wholesale to fill outstanding orders and fabricate her own fabrics."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":1891834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric wholesale to fill her orders and fabricate her own cloth.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-09T12:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-09T12:30:03Z","loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":121,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Regina               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filomena         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena Virginia   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery Isabel        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lizeth           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-29T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-20T04:00:00Z","amount":1475.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T04:00:00Z","amount":1702.21},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T04:00:00Z","amount":1733.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T04:00:00Z","amount":1764.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T04:00:00Z","amount":1796.85},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T04:00:00Z","amount":1829.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T04:00:00Z","amount":1862.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T04:00:00Z","amount":1896.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T04:00:00Z","amount":1931.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T04:00:00Z","amount":1966.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T04:00:00Z","amount":2002.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T04:00:00Z","amount":2038.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.53},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.07},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":273.08},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.05},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":288.26},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":293.51},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":298.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":719.85,"local_amount":4910.58,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4930.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344601},{"amount":790.29,"local_amount":5391.15,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5413.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554813},{"amount":551.13,"local_amount":3759.63,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3775.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468900},{"amount":571.37,"local_amount":3897.73,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3913.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296733},{"amount":592.36,"local_amount":4040.91,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4057.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076898}],"funded_date":"2015-06-18T19:22:01Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":894378,"name":"Sandra Yaneth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sandra es una mujer dedicada a su familia y a su labor.

The town, often called by its full name, Santo Tom\u00e1s Chichicastenango, has a maze of winding streets that surround the main plaza that is also the site of one of the most colorful markets in Central America attracting tourists from all parts of the world. The traditional \u201ctraje\u201d or dress of the women is simply beautiful and consists of a colorful \u201chuipil\u201d or embroidered\/woven blouse, \u201ccorte\u201d or wrap skirt and \u201cfaja\u201d or ornate belt to hold the whole ensemble together. The main industry is traditional textile production, a business that many women do to earn income.\r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cTikal\u201d is located here and consists of eight hard-working women who are determined to reach their goals. They are on their third loan cycle. Petronila, who is 35 years of age, creates beautiful traditional ensembles and has been able to generate an income for herself and her family. Her principle goal is to continue to support her children with their personal and educational needs.

With his loan, he plans to purchase fertilizers and other products to apply to his coffee crop, and so they develop well, in addition to paying for labor costs to apply the products and assistance to the plantation once the harvest is developed and, in this way, assure himself of doing good work. What he plans to do is take advantage of the good climatic and soil conditions in the zone for this crop, and also to put into practice his several years of experience managing the coffee. In addition to being able to purchase better products of better quality so his crops develop well and are healthy, he also wants a good harvest and to have, in the short term, a sizable production. With the income from the harvest that he hopes to get, he wants to use it for his family's well-being and realize some family goals and continue investing more in the crops. This is the first loan that he has gotten from FUDECOSUR. He has never had any other loans from state banks, but FUDECOSUR has offered the loan with better terms and a much lower interest rate.

She  has a dressmaking business.  \r\nAdela is a good mother who is enterprising, strong, tenacious, reliable, responsible, and very hardworking.  She carries out her work in the \"Kuapegai\" neighborhood, which is known for its population of Guarani migrants who came to this place after being displaced from the northern sugarcane farms.  The area has a hot, tropical climate with a temperature that varies between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nAdela has a dark complexion, brown eyes, and long black hair that goes down to the tops of her shoulders.  She is short in stature with a robust physique, and her native language is Guarani, which she speaks in everyday use.  She also speaks Spanish in the general culture and in her business.  She is seen in the center of the photo, wearing a pink shirt and white pants. She shares her life with her children, who are attending school.  They live in their own home, made of wood with a tin roof and an earthen floor.  Their home has potable water and electricity and is connected to a sewer system.\r\n\r\nAdela's desire for success led her to lead a communal bank to request a loan with people that have a variety of businesses such as: curtain-making, the sale of second-hand clothing, bread baking, furniture sales, dressmaking (traditional style skirts), comforter sales, the production of leather wallets, and empanada sales.  She has a dressmaking business where she makes women's clothes.  She takes good measurements to ensure that her garments are well-made, such as measurements of the chest, neck, waist, hip, arms, etc.  These are very important, \"a garment that is made to measure at specific points according to the body of the customer is a very effective tool to look good and make this garment a personalized piece that will serve as a standard,\" she comments.  \r\n\r\nThe advantage of Adela's business is that she has regular customers. The disadvantage is that she lacks some of the tools she needs for her work.  Her dream is to open a big workshop where she could employ others.  She wants to purchase an industrial sewing machine and fabric at wholesale.  This is her 3rd cycle of loans from the institution in the 9 years she has had her business.  This is why Adela is requesting a loan to buy an industrial sewing machine and fabric at wholesale, so that she can open a dressmaking workshop and generate sources of employment."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3162.82,"image":{"id":1892650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy an industrial sewing machine and some fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-09T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-09T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":4375,"lender_count":112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yakelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lenny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karen Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-29T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":4375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-26T04:00:00Z","amount":3331.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T04:00:00Z","amount":3413.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T04:00:00Z","amount":3537.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T04:00:00Z","amount":3666.63},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T04:00:00Z","amount":3800.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T04:00:00Z","amount":3938.41},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":4081.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T04:00:00Z","amount":4230.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":485.82},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":497.81},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":515.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":534.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":554.18},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":574.35},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":595.26},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":616.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":983.63,"local_amount":6744.92,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6747.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344605},{"amount":515.94,"local_amount":3537.85,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3539.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554817},{"amount":534.72,"local_amount":3666.63,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3668.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468904},{"amount":554.18,"local_amount":3800.09,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3801.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296737},{"amount":574.35,"local_amount":3938.41,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3940.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076902}],"funded_date":"2015-06-22T16:00:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":897885,"name":"Rowena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rowena is 28 years old.

children. Dudley works full time as a security guard, and he lives with his family in a modest manufactured home. \r\n\r\nAlthough Dudley and his wife live within their financial means, they have suffered several financial setbacks due to health issues related to their daughter. Dudley\u2019s daughter suffers from a severe medical condition that she has struggled with since birth. The family has made great effort to cover all of the medical costs associated with her disability, but the financial strain on the family became too great when Dudley was deemed disabled for a period of several months, and the household\u2019s income declined significantly. \r\n\r\nDudley has since returned to work full time, and is making great strides to pay any medical bills still owed, but he is now faced with the issue of his home needing several repairs. The family\u2019s air conditioner has stopped working due to age, and the family has been living without a working unit for some time now. It has been difficult living without a working air conditioner, as their home is often hotter than temperatures outdoors, and for this reason, Dudley has come to SELF and Kiva for help. \r\n\r\nDudley hopes to improve the livability and air quality for his family by installing a new high efficiency air conditioner in their home. Not only will this loan help Dudley provide an improved living environment for his family, but it will also help him rebuild his credit over time as he repays his loan. \r\n\r\nDudley will use his loan to pay for a new high efficiency air conditioner that will improve the quality of life for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":257.69,"image":{"id":1889019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

and herself despite many obstacles. Florinda has earned a living for over twenty years as a teacher of childhood development. She is proud of her work and proud of the fact that she has managed to provide for herself and her child solely on her earnings. Unfortunately, she has received very little help raising her child and supporting her household. Despite the lack of child support, Florinda has managed to prepare her child for college. <br \/><br \/>Florinda has unfortunately suffered some financial setbacks due to a family crisis that reflected poorly on her credit. Through the financial hardship, Florinda has managed to pay down a portion of her debt and has established a reasonable plan and timeline to pay the remaining balance owed. Even with her continuous efforts, Florinda has experienced difficulty obtaining funds to make a few necessary repairs to her home due to her damaged credit. <br \/><br \/>Florinda has been without a working air conditioner since October of 2014, and desperately needs to replace the unit as the region is now experiencing sweltering heat. Florinda\u2019s home is higher in temperature inside than the daytime temperature outside, which has made her feel as if she is \u201cliving in an oven.\u201d Florinda is hoping that SELF and Kiva can help her finance a high-efficiency air conditioner that will improve her and her child\u2019s quality of life and make her home livable. This loan will also help Florinda rebuild her credit. <br \/><br \/>Florinda will use her Kiva loan to pay for a new high-efficiency air conditioner that will improve her and her child\u2019s quality

This is Joko, one of Ruma\u2019s agents. Joko lives in North Bogor, a suburban area in West Java located about a one hour and thirty minute drive from Jakarta, the capital city. He is happily married. He and his wife have two cute daughters. <br \/><br \/>Joko owns a stall that sells mobile airtime credits for his community. He already joined Ruma almost a year ago. He knew about Ruma from Ruma\u2019s sales executive who came to his stall. He decided to join Ruma because he already heard before that Ruma has the best service and system. Joko is a hardworking guy, as well as a family minded person. His community sees him as a trusted and informative mobile provider.<br \/> <br \/>As the business grows, Joko is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits to his community.

devoted husband, father and grandfather to his family. Jose and his family have experienced a lot of setbacks recently that have affected Jose and his wife\u2019s credit greatly. After the housing market plummeted, Jose and his wife struggled to pay their living expenses and the mortgage on the home that they love.  Jose\u2019s wife of 40 years suffered a serious medical issue that has left her disabled and totally dependent on Jose\u2019s care. He struggles to make ends meet, but he does the best he can for his family. Jose recently assumed primary custody of his two grandsons, and although this makes Jose\u2019s financial difficulties even harder, he is happy to ensure that they are well taken care of. Jose has since refinanced his home and has made great progress with repairing his credit and getting back on track, but he still needs a bit of help. The family\u2019s air conditioner has stopped working and they are in desperate need of a new unit. With four family members and temperatures soaring, the home has become very uncomfortable to live in during the day, and Jose\u2019s wife cannot afford to deal with the heat considering her current health. Jose is hoping that SELF and Kiva can help finance a new high-efficiency air conditioner that will improve the quality of life for his family as well as save money on their electric bills.\r\n\r\nJose will use his Kiva loan to pay for a new high-efficiency air conditioner to improve his family\u2019s quality of life and save money on the family\u2019s electric bills. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":413.36,"image":{"id":1893870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to purchase a new high-efficiency air conditioner to improve his family\u2019s quality of life and save money on the family\u2019s electric bills.

The lush trees come together on the large hills, from the tops of which the vast sky can be seen with its white clouds.

For two years, she has lived with her partner Alfredo, who had to travel to another community for a good job offer. Therefore M\u00f3nica is the one who is in charge of the meat market that her father-in-law opened seven years ago. \"Really the support I receive is very important in order to continue with the business.

She is in charge of technical garment accessories. Her job includes following up accessories from suppliers and distribute them to the sewers. One of the main concerns of factory employees in the Philippines is how to make ends meet. As minimum wage earner and with the increasing cost of living, Aurora's income is not adequate to provide for their household needs. Sadly these low-income employees do not have access to banks and or other financial institution so Aurora resort to borrowing from money lenders who charge very high interest rates and require her to surrender her ATM (her salary is credited to her ATM acct.) as loan collateral.\n\nAurora is kindly asking your financial assistance to prevent her from being enslaved to loan sharks. Your help will enable her to recover her ATM and pay for the utilities of their house. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying them since the loan payment is deducted every pay day. Aurora aims to be the best in her line of work and hopes for promotion and higher salary.\n\nShe meets up with his co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work. **CCT staff and volunteers conduct weekly fellowship meetings for the factory workers before their work routine to do Bible readings, prayer and discipleship sessions to encourage and inspire them to do their best in life and be the kind of person God wants them to be. \n\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.

group. The members of the group are Umedjon and Dilafruz. Dilafruz is 42 years old. She and her husband have raised five wonderful children, one of whom is Umedjon. Dilafruz also has another son and three daughters. Umedjon is 23 years old. He is not yet married, but he hopes to have a family someday and set a good example for his children, like his father is for him. Umedjon and Dilafruz run the family business together. They run the farming operations and cultivate saplings. The work agrees with them, because they spend their time well and happily, working on the land. Dilafruz and Umedjon have applied for a loan because MLO Humo has a product which can support the family business. Since now is the right time to plant saplings so that they will grow into fruit-bearing trees, they want to use this opportunity to expand their operations. At this point in the process they do not have enough fertilizer and do not currently have the funds to buy more, so they have applied for a loan.

Desde hace 23 a\u00f1os la pareja se ha dedicado a la compra y venta de productos para el hogar, espec\u00edficamente pa\u00f1os para cocina y toallas para ba\u00f1o. Paty menciona que comenzaron la actividad por falta de un empleo fijo. Actualmente el negocio funciona bien, gracias al esfuerzo y a que siempre tratan de comprar la mercanc\u00eda por mayoreo para conseguir un mejor precio.

Presently they are seeking a loan from VisionFund Mexico to improve their businesses.  The group's name is in Mazhua, their native language, and means, \"the place where they are\".  \r\n\r\nDona Patricia is a dedicated person with a positive attitude.  In her community, her friends call her Paty.  Her family consists of Antonio, her husband, and five children of whom four are still studying.  \r\n\r\nFor 23 years she and her husband have worked in the purchase and sale of home goods.  Specifically they have sold kitchen cloths and bath towels.  Paty mentioned that they began this job due to lack of steady employment.  Now the business runs well, thanks to their effort and to the fact that they purchase their goods wholesale to get a better price.  For this reason the loan from VisionFund was a great aid to continue this job.  This time it will help to buy more kitchen towels.  \r\n\r\nPaty and her husband sell in Toluca or Mexico City, both of which are located three hours from their community.  They prefer to sell in those places because it is easier to sell in the cities than in their smaller community.  However, in these cities they cannot count on a consistent location where they can display their goods.  They sell on foot, covering the street of the zone.  When they have too much merchandise, they have a friend take it over in order to avoid the cost of transporting it home.  \r\n\r\n\"Truly I am very thankful for the support of VisionFund because I was able to increase my business and construct the house that we never had\", commented Dona Paty.  Her goal now is to increase her business to be able to better her quality of life and continue supporting her children in their studies.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:  Maria del Carmen, who will invest in typical snacks, Adelaida, who will buy paper goods, Maria Alberta, who will invest in her grocery store, Bernarda, who will purchase blender cups, Angelica, who will purchase household goods,   and Maria Maximina who will buy costume jewelry.  In the photo, Paty is wearing a pink sweater.  The photo was taken in the plaza by the arches, located in their town.  The church and gazebo can be seen.

Due to job scarcity in Metro Manila, she dared to work in a garment factory in the province of Cavite, where the minimum wage is much lower than in Metro Manila but the cost of living is almost the same. She has been working there for eight long years that prove her patience and dedication to work. As a Controller, she is responsible for inspecting the quality of products as well as supervising some levels of the workforce. She also does the delicate task of keeping records on products and items. \r\n\r\nMelanie is still single, but her responsibilities in her family cannot be discounted. In the Philippines, where families are known to be so closely knit, single persons are expected to help with their family\u2019s expenses, including those for basic needs such as food, utilities, siblings\u2019 education, parents' medicines, and incidentals like transportation to the province. Most of the time, low-income earners like Melanie can barely make both ends meet, and they have no access to banks and other financial institutions. This is the reason they are usually victimized by usurious money-lenders who charge them with very high interest rates and capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. Melanie is thankful that she now has other options, because she is a member of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*. She is very much looking forward to your help so she can provide the transportation expenses of her parents to their home province in the Visayas-Mindanao region. This home visit is very important to her aging parents, but it will require them to travel by air or sea, which is quite expensive. \r\n\r\nAs a responsible and loving daughter, Melanie wants to make her family happy at all times, uplift them from poverty, own a decent house, and start a small business in the future. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work. *The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment.

He and his wife, Florentina, who is also a sewer,  both work hard to provide all the needs of their four children. As a Sampling Sewer, Romeo prepares the sample clothing that serves as a basis for other sewers to reproduce. It\u2019s a delicate job that requires creativity and initiative. \n\nFortunately, Romeo is aptly fitted for it. Romeo is also a beneficiary of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative,* an organization that helps guide Romeo and other members to acquire necessary skills for the job and strengthen their spiritual and devotional life.  \n\nRomeo and his wife are both hardworking but there would always come a time when big financial needs arise. This time, Romeo is in that situation. He needs to pay the graduation fee of their child and he humbly seeks your help. He is sincerely praying that you could be part of their child\u2019s first step to success.\n\nRomeo further dreams to run a successful business in the near future and he meets up with his co-fellowship** members to share stories of his life and work. *The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment. \n\nThe cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.

She has a high school education and works in farming and animal husbandry. Thanks to her hard work and patient character Vera now has a solid farm. She has three cows which produce organic milk, and a 2 hectare plot where she grows beans and clover. She also cures and sells chicken legs. Vera's monthly income is 17,000 KGS, which is not enough to sustain her and her son. Since raising livestock is her main business, Vera has decided to develop it further. She applied for a loan of 50,000 KGS at Bai Tushum Bank to purchase seeds and till the land so she can grow organic produce. Vera plans to invest the income she earns in purchasing more livestock, which will allow her to feed and take care of her son.

He is married and has one child. He first turned to MDO Arvand when he found out that he could receive financial support. Bahrullokhuja lives with his family in the countryside. He doesn't have any higher education, because he couldn't afford to go to university. Bahrullokhuja's wife is also not university educated and is a housewife - she takes care of the domestic duties and feeding the children. In order to earn a living, Bahrullokhuja runs his business. He fattens up and sells cattle and the milk he gets from them. He makes a good income from his business. His wife also helps on the farm, taking care of the cattle and milking them.

She grew up in a working family. After graduating from school she got married. Habiba has a high school education. She is a caring and attentive mother to three children. Habiba's husband Bahodir is a cook. But his salary is not enough to support the family and send the children to school. Therefore, Habiba and her husband decided to raise livestock for additional income. Twice a month Habiba's husband buys cattle at the market.   Habiba and the children fatten them up, then, two or three months later, resell them. A portion of the proceeds goes towards feed and the rest helps support the family. Habiba's children help her on the farm in their free time. And most of Habiba's free time is spent taking care of the cattle. After talking with her husband, Habiba decided to increase her cattle stock. Since they do not currently have the funds to purchase more cattle, they decided to apply for a loan from MDO Arvand. With this loan they plan to expand their business, to supplement their income and thus support the family and their children's studies.
