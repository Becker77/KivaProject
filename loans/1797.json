She has a high school education and is now retired. She is a hardworking, responsible and purposeful person who has been working in animal husbandry since 1993 as an additional source of income. Thanks to her hard work, she currently has four cows and a horse on her farm. Her business brings in a monthly income of about 17,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nHer children help out by sending money, but Kanikei wants to be independent.

Thus, she is asking if she could take out a loan amounting to PHP 15,000 that she would use in purchasing additional supplies of merchandise products such as grocery items, toiletries, beverages and other similar products. The hope is that you'll consider this because this is a lot more now to her. It would be a great remedy for her family's daily living expenses. \r\n\r\nSomeday, she dreams of nothing more than to just be successful in life. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and there, she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Agnes hopes to expand her business by adding to selection of supplies in order to meet the demands of consumers. It will help sustain their everyday needs and will surely boost her savings. She wants to prepare early for the educational needs of her children. She humbly seeks your help through PhP 8,000 loan that she will use to buy more supplies for her variety store. \r\n\r\nAgnes meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. She\u2019s praying that eventually her children will enjoy a comfortable life that God wants all of us to have.  \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has a university degree and works at a hospital. Through her hard work, she now owns two cows and twenty sheep. Her total income amounts to about 12,500 som (KGS) per month. This money is not enough for a dignified life or for raising a child.

Her family had a huge debt before but they were able to pay it off little by little. \r\n\r\nAntonietta lives in Tigbauan, Iloilo with her children and grandchildren. She owns a variety store that also suffered from some losses before. She has recovered it eventually and today she is planning to add more supplies. She is also retailing cellphone load though e-load which is very popular in the Philippines. Income from her business can now support their day to day expenses. Furthermore, her son is planning to work abroad to earn better wages.\r\nAntonietta\u2019s whole family is saving for the needed placement fee for the overseas job. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting for a PhP 40,000 loan to buy more supplies particularly soft drinks and other beverages. Part of the loan will be set aside for her son\u2019s placement fee. She\u2019s hoping that God will use you to extend support to her and her family. Your help will be very much appreciated. \r\n\r\nAntonietta is always inspired to meet with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business. They draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":787.5,"image":{"id":1899023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He has no children or family, and all that matters to him is his business as a tailor, with which he supports himself. He has survived some hard times, competing with businesses in the city of Medellin for contracts. However, since he is located in a rural zone he has not had the success that he has hoped for, and is looking for other ways to earn income. Relying on his experience and knowledge, and making use of his machinery, he started producing his own line of clothing. Thanks to his work he earned enough capital to support himself. He would now like to return to Medellin to show his samples. He hopes with great enthusiasm that they will be well received so that production can start. Also, because he does not like to be idle, he is thinking of a new collection of clothing that he can display on his sidewalk. Demetrio is requesting a loan to buy fabric.    He will use the capital to place an order for the things that he needs to produce his new line of clothing.

Boronkul owns three cows, twenty-five sheep and a horse. She grows safflower and clover on her 5ha plot of land. This brings her about 11,000 som (KGS) a month. Hoping to expand her business, Boronkul is requesting a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) from Bai-Tushum bank in order to buy additional livestock for fattening up and resale.

Her husband currently works in Russia. Two of their children go to school and two other children are still small. \r\n\r\nZeboniso works in sales. She buys bulk dairy products (for example, qurut cheese) and resells them at retail prices. Qurut is traditional white ball-shaped cheese, as you can see in the picture. It is made of condensed \u201ckatyk\u201d, strained and thickened sour milk. A bag with katyk is usually suspended for a few days in the shade until it gets dry. What stays is a thick, nutritious mass. One adds salt and shapes the cheese into 1-5 cm balls. These balls are then dried in the sun for a few more days.\r\n\r\nZeboniso has been doing this work for five years. She is requesting a loan in order to keep up her retail business. She needs the money to be able to transport the dairy products she sells. She would like to increase turnover and expand her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":261.57,"image":{"id":1899736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to increase turnover and expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Vose","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"37.8025 69.644167","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-06-10T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-10T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zeboniso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":292.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":320.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":322.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":335.31},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":352.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":355.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":386.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":392.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":405.7},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":422.3},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":445.43},{"due_date":"2016-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":468.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.02},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.84},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.2},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.36},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.04},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.76},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":98.75,"local_amount":612.91,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:27:12Z","rounded_local_amount":618.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696610161},{"amount":51.96,"local_amount":322.5,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:32:06Z","rounded_local_amount":325.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711526186},{"amount":54.02,"local_amount":335.31,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":338.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731041955},{"amount":56.84,"local_amount":352.78,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":355.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752130917}],"funded_date":"2015-07-05T23:41:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Oksana Buranbaeva","image":194074}},{"id":898224,"name":"Juan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Juan from Tigbauan, Iloilo.

He also buys and sells charcoal and firewood and distributes these with his multicab vehicle. His income from this endeavor can help provide for their everyday needs and children\u2019s education. However, there are times when his multicab doesn\u2019t function well because it\u2019s already deteriorating. It needs some spare parts for repair and maintenance. Juan also dreams of expanding his business in the near future. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, he wants to embark on farming and buy a motor hand tractor to make his farming easier. He knows that all these ventures will contribute to the completion of his children\u2019s education and successful future. He really is a man of many practical goals in life. He needs your help in order to attain all these. He knocks at your kind heart for a loan assistance of PhP 15,000 which he can use to repair his multicab. With this he can continue his buying and selling of firewood and charcoal.

She lives with her husband and two little sons (6 and 4-years-old). \r\n\r\nAs a main source of income for her family, she works with field crop cultivation, after having started 10 years ago. Thanks to Tehmine's and her husband's persistent work, they currently get good harvests of potato, cabbage and greens and sell them in the market. Tehmine and her husband have a dream to expand their land cultivation work and gather more harvest. Tehmine asks this loan to purchase some arable land and be able to make their dream come true. \r\n\r\nAs this is her first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The First-Chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before because they have no credit history. Through this joint initiative, almost 500 borrowers like Tehmine get a chance to have their first loans and develop their businesses.\r\n \r\nTehmine hopes to receive lenders' support ensuring responsible monthly payments.

Even if it\u2019s just a low-cost housing unit which is usually bare or \u201cbox-type,\u201d its monthly amortization will still cut a large chunk from the worker\u2019s regular salary. It is commonly payable in 25 to 30 years, meaning this amortization will always affect the family\u2019s other needs such as food, utilities and education.\n\nThere were times that Mary Jane skipped paying their house amortization due to bloating family expenditures. This is why she is quite thankful for your previous support that went a long way and saved the whole family. She has been faithful in paying her previous loan. \n\nLately, she again had trouble balancing their expenses vis-\u00e0-vis their income and she needed to prioritize the most important expenses like education and medical costs. As of now, the amortization needs to be paid soon before their housing unit gets forfeited. Mary Jane doesn\u2019t want to find her family homeless thus she badly needs your support again. \n\nMary Jane cannot easily produce that large amount of money, even though she receives a regular salary as a sewer in a garment factory in GMA, Cavite. Her husband Emmy has an irregular salary as a welder. Simultaneously, it\u2019s enrollment season and they disbursed some amount for their child\u2019s schooling. \n\nMary Jane desires that their child becomes a successful professional and gains a more decent living wage someday. She also dreams of completing their house amortization so that they can legally call their house their own.\n\nLuckily, Mary Jane is well guided as one of the beneficiaries of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative. This organization has arranged for an easy repayment scheme through salary deduction for their members and beneficiaries. Mary Jane continues to meet with her co-fellowship members in the Covenant Community Service Cooperative.

She has been working as a Washing Quality Control Officer in a garment factory located in GMA, Cavite for eleven years now. Her job includes supervision of the washing process for garments and clothes, inspecting the quality of the washed products, as well as monitoring of some workers in the washing area.\r\n\r\nElaine is married to Romy, a tricycle driver, and they have four children. Elaine\u2019s minimum wage combined with her husband\u2019s irregular income as driver cannot usually suffice their growing financial needs. Their usual problem is how to make ends meet, because aside from basic needs such as food and utilities, they spend too much in transportation to and from their work area. Moreover, they are burdened with their children\u2019s education. It\u2019s not easy to raise four children and provide for their educational needs. When it\u2019s time for enrollment, they look for reasonable loan and financial assistance but they are being lured by usurious lending agencies with very high interest rates. The couple, especially Elaine, is trying to avoid these loan sharks knowing that these usurious agencies will require her to surrender her ATM card as loan collateral. It is a blessing that she became a member of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative* where she found another option. It is her prayer that you can help her provide for her children\u2019s tuition and avoid the lure of usurious money lenders. \r\n\r\nFor Filipino families like Elaine\u2019s, education is the most valued inheritance that they can give to their children. She trusts the Lord that their children will finish education through your kind help.\r\n\r\nElaine meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and work. *The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services. **CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before they start their daily work routines. Bible readings, prayer devotions, and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1897604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children.  Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.  The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nDuhaga School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.  Winnie ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1897249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

When she was in the work force, Ellen and her husband traveled to Hawaii often for his job in the military, and Ellen began raising orchids. She discovered that she was talented at raising orchids and many people were interested in purchasing her beautiful flowers. In fact, her husband built her a greenhouse and she had over 200 orchids at one point. When they moved, Ellen sadly had to give up this passion. \r\n\r\nIn retirement, she has re-established her love for home decor and design, as well as gardening. Recently, Ellen bought 600 orchids, which she has been growing and raising, and she plans to sell these through her new online store. \r\n\r\nLast year, she participated in a six month training, where she learned via phone classes about online business. She learned about SEO and marketing, as well as methods for online sales, pricing, and general business information. Through this, Ellen has been able to more successfully start her online business and create an online presence through eBay and Facebook.\r\n\r\nShe established Cissy's Home D\u00e9cor in July 2014 and began selling products online. Her store involves the online retail of large furniture, especially garden items such as planters for discounted rates as well as Ellen\u2019s orchids. The business has been operating strictly through eBay for the past nine months, and is now expanding to a more established method of sales. \r\n\r\nShe will use her Kiva loan to pay the fees associated with being an established seller on eBay.

She has been operating the business for almost two years now. She has four kids and is married to Roberto. Whatever income she gets basically from her chosen trade, she uses to help her husband in sustaining the family's expenses. \r\n\r\nFilipinos are fond of eating. And it is a big help to most when there are food stalls along the roads where they can eat at a hand without even going home to just merely cook. Perhaps this is the reason why Yolanda has chosen to manage a food stall. But Yolanda's food stall is different because it's a food stall on wheels. Mainly, she cooks street foods like fish balls, squid balls etc. A little help for the buyers because they won't need to walk a distant walk just to get food. With the business, she really earns well. \r\n\r\nHowever, Yolanda still wants to expand her business. She is asking a loan worth PHP 8,000. She will use this to buy more quantity of raw ingredients needed for her recipes. She wants to send to you her sincerest thanks for your goodness and generosity by now. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she wants her family to experience progress and improve as well in her current business. She also prays for the good health of the household and the education of her children.

Due to this mere fact, Isidoro, 45, found business himself in clothing industry. He is a very hard working entrepreneur from Batasan, Quezon City, Philippines. Marialyn, his wife, helps him to provide for their family needs. As of now, she operates a buy-and-sell business of ready-to-wear products. Through this, he is able to gain a little profit which he basically uses for primary expenditures within the household. \r\n\r\nHere, he buys general merchandise from wholesalers and then sell them in retail to mostly people within their community. Products can range from ready-to-wear clothing and other similar products. Customers are attracted to buy due to favorable prices and the many options they are offering. \r\n\r\nWith a humble heart, Isidro would like to avail a 25,000 PHP loan to purchase more products and merchandise to sell. He will use his loan to improve his sales and his additional revenue to improve the general living conditions of his family.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he hopes to have more branches for his business. He also desires for his children to be able to complete their studies and have their stable works.
