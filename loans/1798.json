the mother of two children. Her son is a student and her daughter is a school pupil. Aziya has a secondary education. In search of income for her family, she began rearing animals and growing crops. She started her business 20 years ago. Thanks to her back-breaking work, Aziya has achieved great success and gets a profit of about 9,000 som (KGS) per month.

","en":"Gaybullo is a 37-year-old man. He is married. He is the caring father of three children. He has a secondary education. He wanted to apply to university, but since he was the eldest child in the family he had to help his father support the family. So after graduating from secondary school he started looking for a job, but his father advised him to rear animals. Having listened to his father, he started his own business. He bought some cattle, raised them, and resold them. After he got married, his wife also began helping her husband.\r\n\r\nAs it is known, everyone strives to earn as much as possible in a market economy. After he got married, Gaybullo's outgoings doubled and he was not able to completely cover all of his expenses. He started growing livestock feed for additional income. He began getting a good harvest from the second half of last year sufficient for him to feed more then ten heads of cattle for a whole period. His wife and children help him with this. Having saved his money in this way, Gaybullo wanted to increase the size of his herd and expand his business. But he can buy no more than three heads of cattle with the money that he has saved, and Gaybullo wants to buy six heads of cattle. With this aim he has applied to Arvand for help. Gaybullo is buying cattle with the received loan, and increasing the size of his business. He is grateful to MDO Arvand for its support and the development of his business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":357.43,"image":{"id":1896294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-06-11T12:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-11T12:20:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gaybullo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":536.31},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":539.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":560.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":588.07},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":592.14},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":641.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":650.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":672.21},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":709.59},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":728.46},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":780.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.71},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.02},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.62},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.03},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.04},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.07},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.19,"local_amount":536.31,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-01T12:11:49Z","rounded_local_amount":539.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696605120},{"amount":86.71,"local_amount":539.54,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-20T12:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":542.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711524626},{"amount":90.02,"local_amount":560.11,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":563.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731040469},{"amount":94.51,"local_amount":588.07,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":591.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755520139}],"funded_date":"2015-07-11T07:54:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":894617,"name":"Gladis Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gladis de 37 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su de esposo y su hijo, ella se dedica a la agricultura desde hace 25 a\u00f1os comercializa sus productos en los alrededores de la zona donde ella reside, con lo que obtiene de sus ventas logra solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, Gladis  est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de abono, semillas, fertilizante etc. Y as\u00ed poder tener mejores ingresos econ\u00f3micos.","en":"Gladis is 37 years old, and lives in her own home with her husband and son.

He got several group loans with the institution, and the loan he is currently requesting is to buy manure to provide better care forhis coffee crops and thus improve production.

She is a hard working woman, and the motivating force for her are her daughters, because even though they do not have their father,  she has been very responsible providing their education and all the necessary means to help them get ahead. Several years ago she learned to sew, and with her small savings she was able to buy a sewing machine. For the past two years she has offered her services sewing clothing. She works from home, and she is responsible for providing the finishing touches to the clothing received from factories.

","en":"Jamila is a young woman who lives in a rural area. She is 31, married, and has three children. Her husband works on private construction projects in Russia. The money he sends home is not enough to support his family. Jamila has been raising small livestock for nine years already. She buys young animals and fattens them for a few months, then sells them for a higher price. This is the main source of income for her family. Thanks to her business, her family is provided for and lacks nothing. Jamila wants her children to be able to get a decent education and become professionals, not to struggle like their parents. At the moment Jamila is having business difficulties because she cannot sell livestock due to low prices. She needs to buy feed, so she applied for a loan with Arvand for financial support. She wants to use the money to buy livestock feed and at the same time take advantage of the market to buy young animals at a low price.

He is 42 years old and has two children who are both at school (12 and 16 years old). The married couple runs the activity which generates the family's income together; it is a small cafe that they have been running for ten years now. It was Narcis Alain's brother who gave him the idea to do this, as beforehand he was a security guard and then a taxi-bus conductor. He has a good commercial spirit and is very welcoming.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan so that he can buy a freezer and retile the floor of the caf\u00e9. The aim of the refurbishment and this investment is to retain his existing customers' loyalty and bring in new customers, but also to be able to work in a hygenic and well equipped place. The family still lives in a rented house, but he is planning to buy a piece of land and build a small house.\r\n "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":295.75,"image":{"id":1897038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a freezer and floor tiles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MG","country":"Madagascar","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-20 47","type":"point"}},"partner_id":443,"posted_date":"2015-06-11T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-11T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narcis Alain","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MGA","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":285000},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":285000},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":285000},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":285000},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":285000},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":285000},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":260000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.63},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.62},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":149.5,"local_amount":460000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":470927.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696543713},{"amount":146.25,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:00:21Z","rounded_local_amount":460689.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730978072}],"funded_date":"2015-06-11T20:24:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":896979,"name":"Fabolona  Ii Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les  08 membres du groupe  FABOLONA II  sont des femmes mari\u00e9es  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 47 ans, 3 enfants et vivant toutes dans des  familles polygames \u00e0 DANGASSA, un des villages de NIANGADINA, 2\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nElles collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de mener \u00e0 bien leurs activit\u00e9s agricoles pendant l\u2019hivernage. \nElles sont \u00e0 leur cinqui\u00e8me pr\u00eat de campagne avec l\u2019institution.\nLa sp\u00e9culation cultiv\u00e9e est  l\u2019arachide, le riz et le mil avec SITAN,  assise  au milieu sur la photo.\nAvec son pr\u00eat, elle compte acheter des intrants, des semences et payer les frais de labour pour entretenir  0,5 hectares. \nLa production est vendue au niveau du village, apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9colte \u00e0 une client\u00e8le compos\u00e9e de revendeurs et de consommateurs. \nElle compte r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice moyen de  75.000FCFA par campagne.\nCe b\u00e9n\u00e9fice lui permettra de payer son pr\u00eat et aussi d\u2019aider son mari dans les d\u00e9penses quotidiennes.\n","en":"The eight members of the group \u201cFABOLONA II\u201d are married women, who average 47 years of age and three children each, all living in polygamous families in DANGASSA, a village in NIANGADINA (2nd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).

He is 64 years old, married, the caring father of two children and the beloved grandfather of six grandchildren.  Ruziqul was born and grew up in the countryside.  He has always had a passion for learning, which led him to study at a pedagogical institute.  After graduation, he became a biology teacher and worked in a school for 25 years.  Today, Ruziqul is retired but still very active.  He can't just sit at home and do nothing.  For this reason, he decided to start his own business.  He recently bought some cattle, fattened his animals up and sold them again.  Thanks to this activity, he made quite a good income.  However, he has spent his earnings to buy animal feed and he currently doesn't have enough money to buy additional cattle.  In order to increase his cattle headcount, he has therefore turned to MDO Arvand and requested a loan.  This loan will allow him to increase the size of his herd.  He expresses his gratitude toward MDO Arvand for their assistance and support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.43,"image":{"id":1901207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow.

She is a good mom, enterprising, responsible and very hard-working.  She has her own business making and selling cheese.  She started the business at her house in Cutusuma, a small town on the southeast coast of Lake Titicaca.  Fishing and agriculture are common occupations for the people here.

The house has electricity and water that the family pumps from their own well.  \r\nTomasa keeps dairy cows that produce the milk she needs to make cheese.  The milk is produced according to strict requirements for milk production and each cow produces between 4 and 6 liters of milk per day.  \"When I first started, I was selling the milk that I produced, but as I learned the business I graduated to cheese-making\", she says.  She sells her product to locals, visitors and tourists.  She advantage of cheese-making is that there is a lot of demand for handmade cheeses here.  Tomasa's problem is that she can't increase her cheese production because she doesn't have the milk she needs to do so.  She wants to sell cheese in the city, but she needs more dairy cattle to produce the milk she needs to increase her cheese production.  \r\nTomasa has operated her business for 15 years and she is applying for this loan, her first, to buy more dairy cattle.

He is married and has two children. He has a very tight-knit family. They live in a rural location. In order to have income for the family, all of the members of the family try to earn money somehow. Each works as he can. Abdurauf's main and stable business is rearing animals. He breeds and sells cattle. His wife helps him with this work. She looks after the cattle, and also sells the milk they get from them. The animal rearing business gives Abdurauf a good and stable income, so he wants to expand this business. He needs to buy several more heads of cattle to raise and resell in the future. For this Abdurauf has turned to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to buy the cattle. He hopes that this business will expand successfully and bring more profits in order to satisfy the needs of the family well. Abdurauf thanks Arvand in advance for its

She obtained a patent for her scarves and started selling them on stands and counters.  \n\nOne of Yasemin's friends told her about microcredit opportunities.

Latofat is a widow and has a son whom she is raising alone. She has been in business for 22 years. At the beginning she used to sell groceries. Having gradually increased her stock, she began trading children's and women's clothing. Having saved up enough money, she acquired a store at the local market. Now she has decided to expand her business since she has rented another store.

Then, when he gathers the harvest, he takes it to a large market and sells it there. He previously used to work on a farm and then decided to sell his own crops. He also works as an electrician to get additional income. His wife works as a teacher in their village. But now Abduboqi wants to expand the crop-growing side of business. But at present he does not have enough of his own funds to buy mineral fertilizer and treat his land. As a result he has turned to Arvand and wants to take a loan to buy mineral fertilizer and treat his land.

She is a widow and the mother of two children. She did not get a higher education as there was not enough money to pay for university. She got married after graduating from school. Anzurat has been rearing animals for the past 20 years. She has fifteen sheep and three cows in her herd. She fattens and sells the sheep, buys young ones in their place and then fattens them up in the same way up to a certain weight. Anzurat also prepares milk.\r\n\r\nAnzurat's husband died six years ago. She lives with her eldest son and his family. He has four children. They all live together in one room. They have to be very close. For this reason Anzurat has decided to start construction and build a separate room for herself for her old age. The room is almost ready, but the windows and floor remain to be installed. Anzurat is already elderly and can fall sick from the cold or the heat, so she has decided to install vinyl windows and a heated floor. But at present she has insufficient money. She has therefore applied to MDO Arvand for financial support. Anzurat is grateful for the support and trust."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":241.58,"image":{"id":1899155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She operates her business in a rural area called El Abra that is known for a nearby prison.  This area has a mild climate throughout the year and the day-time temperatures vary from 7- to 23-degrees, Centigrade.\nPrimitiva is a dark-skinned woman with brown eyes and black hair, worn in long braids.  She is shorter-than-average height and strongly built.  She wears traditional dress (hat, sweater, overdress).  She speaks Quechua, her first language, at home and Spanish that she uses in her  business.  Primitiva's husband is a farmer and her children are in school.  They live in a small house with one bedroom in a land that they own. This house is made of concrete and bricks with a dirt floor.  \nThe house has electricity, but isn't plumbed for water and the family pumps the water they need from a well instead. There is no sewage system. Water service is now available in the area.  \n\n\u201cWe live here most of our lives and clean water is recently available; it is a priority to connect to the water system for the benefit of our families \u2026,\" she says. The advantage of her business is that her business demand is constant and has daily sales, and the disadvantage is the lack of clean water for her young children. Her dream is to have clean water in her home. she wants to connect clean water in her kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room; so that, her family will stop drinking dirty water from the river. This is the first loan she is requesting to the institution in 10 years she is doing this activity.\nIt is for these reasons that Primitiva requests a loan for accessing clean water in her kitchen, bathroom and laundry room; so that, this will save her children from the dangers of drinking contaminated river water.\n  "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1882910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to access clean water and save her children from the dangers of drinking contaminated river water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-11T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-11T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Primitiva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":479.09},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":483.09},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":494.71},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":501.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":515.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":525.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":144.32,"local_amount":962.18,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":995.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344554},{"amount":74.49,"local_amount":496.57,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":513.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554764},{"amount":74.97,"local_amount":499.83,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":517.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468850},{"amount":156.22,"local_amount":1041.42,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1077.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296683}],"funded_date":"2015-06-12T02:43:44Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:15:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":898768,"name":"Rosemary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosemary 31 years old, is married and supports 3 children.

She\u2019s a strong woman considering the trials that she experienced in her life.

However, the income derived from her store varies from time to time, as it is usually affected by the competition within the area. Its stability is also shaken by some of her neighbors who have the habit of paying later for those items they get. Sometimes it takes few days or weeks before they pay. She is a kind-hearted person who cannot refuse her neighbors because she understands that there are times when it\u2019s really hard to earn money. \r\n\r\nBecause of this, she needs additional capital to make her business more stable. She plans to buy more stocks and she is requesting for PhP 50,000. With this additional capital, she would be able to boost her income and savings. She\u2019s praying that you have the kind heart to extend support to her. It will surely go a long way.\r\n\r\nCorazon dreams that all her children would be successful and have a better life in the future.

They have three children, two of whom are in high school and one stays at home. In addition to paying the fees for her children in school, she works hard to support and maintain the household\u2019s daily expenses.\r\n\r\nLorina operates a \u201csari-sari\u201d store, a small convenience store in the Philippines. There she sells fresh, dry and packaged commodities, with almost all of her products being essential household items and food. She buys these goods at wholesale prices, then sells them by the piece to her neighbors and the local community. This type of store is very common in the Philippines, and the competition is stiff. Fortunately, she has a space for grilling chicken. She sells the grilled chicken by piece or chopped. It\u2019s quite laborious for her, but she persists through the help of her family.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her variety store and grill space, Lorina is applying for a PhP 30,000 loan which she will use to buy more grocery items such as canned goods, instant noodles, sachets and packs of toiletries and many others. Part of it will be used for additional chicken to be grilled. This will make her business more stable and she will be able to increase her income. In due time, she plans to build an extension of her store soon or look for another place to put up another store.\r\n\r\nShe wants her children to get a college education to bring them better opportunities in life. She thanks God and you in advance for this financial assistance, for it will surely bring supplementary income for the family.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community clients such as Lorina are organized into fellowship groups of fifteen to thirty members who meet on a weekly basis. There they share stories of their work, repay microfinance loans and draw strength and inspiration from their study of the Word of God."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1900013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She has a higher education. For 20 years she has been farming: rearing animals and growing crops. Her monthly income today is about 18,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Klara's hard work, she now has a good farm: five cows and ten sheep. Klara grows potatoes on 1.17 hectares of land for use on the farm and for sale. She sells milk on a daily basis. In order to further develop her business, she has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to buy ten sheep and fertilizer for her crops. Klara is the leader of the Tilektesh group which, besides her, comprises another two people.
