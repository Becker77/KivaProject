Alexander believes he has a chance in this sphere because he knows where to buy merchandise wholesale and where to sell it retail later. Alexander is originally from Nikopol.

He is married with a teenage daughter. \r\n\r\nAlexander buys strawberries, sweet cherries, grapes, peaches, apricots and walnuts in Nikopol region for further resale in bigger cities in Ukraine. At this moment he is seeking a loan of 70,000 Grivnyas to purchase early sweet cherries and strawberries for further resale. One of Alexander's dreams is to buy land and plant different nut trees there to ensure independent retirement for himself and a better living for his family. However, this dream requires big investments and his business needs to be upgraded to a different level. \r\n\r\nAlexander is working towards that big dream and is planning to re-invest profit

","en":"Malika is a married woman. She has one son who is 27 years old. She does not have any other children. Malika is an honest and cheerful woman. She wants to start providing tailoring services from home. For eight years, Malika has been sewing for herself, and now she wants to start her own small business. Sewing is only for women, but there are men who also know how to sew. Any activity depends only on oneself, that is on the person doing it. Malika knows her work well.

He lives in Kitwe, which is the largest city in Zambia,and operates his mobile money transfer business. The business not only provides for himself, but also his siblings. James likes to describe his business as the service of sending and receiving money from one location to another in Zambia. He started operating the business as a way to provide for his family. James enjoys the business because it is an opportunity for him to provide much needed financial services within the community. He enjoys interacting with all the customers from different walks of life that do business at his outlet. James requests a Kiva loan to purchase some branding materials such as paint and signage so that he can attract more customers who need to send or receive money at his shop.

Since her direct selling business is already stable, she now wants to improve her another business. Once more, she would like to ask your help. She's borrowing a 45,000 peso loan that would hand her enough quantities of frozen meats like chicken and pork and beef to sell. She prays that you'll allow her with this. \r\n\r\nShe has proven once that she's faithful in repaying. And she hopes that you trust her once again. With hope and faith, she believes that through this, she'll be able to earn well for her children's education.

However, this work demanded that she spent a lot of time away from her home and exhausting physical effort. Her partner received some money from the company where he works and he gave her the initial capital to open a general store that is very conveniently located for the people in the part of the neighborhood where she lives in the town of Soledad. Her customers can find at hand all types of stationary, skin care and hair care products, and laundry products  such as detergents and softeners. She also has washing machines that people can use. She has been able to build-up a good number of customers in the 3 years that she has been in business and the majority of them are friends, neighbors, family, and referrals. Her marketing chain happens through advertising specials in her display case, over the telephone for her washing machines, and detergents are a \"hook\" product for her. Every day, from 7am to 8pm, her customers can buy products or use her services. She is currently applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing she will have had from Fundac\u00edon Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy a display case and a washing machine, and stock-up on new products.

This is why she is now requesting a loan, along with a group of other people, to buy silk thread, German embroidery thread, and 2-ply Mish thread so that she can keep coloring the beautiful costumes of the community. \r\nManuela hopes to raise a loan so that she can buy more materials and, in this way, improve her income so that she can later set-up a store where she could better display her own work and so she can build a house. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":333.35,"image":{"id":1894921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to buy silk thread, German embroidery thread, and 2-ply Mish thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Quiche","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2015-06-13T11:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-13T11:30:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pedro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maynor Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":511.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681267998},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":511.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696477780},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":511.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711385432},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:17:31Z","rounded_local_amount":511.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731215523},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":511.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752001009}],"funded_date":"2015-06-17T15:02:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":899304,"name":"Rafael","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rafael desire to go to school was already long, but because his family situation was not good, he applied to follow the Student Loan program of Kiva.

She lives there with her husband, Kamal, who is a farmer. This young couple has no children at present. Punyamala is lucky enough that in her young age she had the opportunity to receive secondary education. \r\n\r\nBeing a housewife, Punyamala helps her husband in farming, such as weeding and caring for the crops before harvesting the crops. They cultivate different vegetables in different seasons. The difficulties that have arisen along the way are the rising cost of farm inputs and the instability of prices for buying and selling vegetables. \r\n\r\nNow, as the family expenses are increasing day by day, Punyamala feel the need to further improve their agricultural activities. They have decided to cultivate chili in order to diversify their business.
