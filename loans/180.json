They are all independent and have their own families, but  they still live with Rosa in the house she owns.    For five years she has earned her living by selling meals.  She gets up very early, at 3:00AM, to prepare a variety of meals, which she sells to the workers on a construction site.  In highest demand is her traditional chicken soup, which is very hearty, and typically eaten to get one's strength back.  Rosa is done selling her soup by 6:00AM at the latest.  What she likes about her work is that her clients take pleasure in her good service and flavorful food.  In addition, business is profitable as there is no competition in the area.

Since he was a boy he learned how to care for each of his crops such as potatoes, beans, barley and peas.  When he began his family, he also began to raise livestock, which his wife is responsible for.  In recent years he has been planting more peas because they are very profitable with little investment.  At each of his small farms he delicately cares for them, his serene watch fixed on each of his plants watching their process.  \r\n<p> \r\nThrough all of this time his cultivations have given him financial well being for the support of his family and the education of his children.  For this reason David loves his job and feels very proud to work the land with his own hands.  And now that his children have grown, they help him with his cultivations and in consequence they have plans to increase their production and to not only have irrigated land but also temporary land.\r\n<p> \r\nDavid is a very serene client and is stable in his attendance at each repayment meeting of his communal bank along with the rest of the members.

For 22 years, she has dedicated herself to farming and raising livestock.  She plants mostly potatoes and shares the daily tasks of this endeavor with her husband.  When there is a harvest on a weekend, she is also helped by her older children who travel from another city.  All the long years of experience have taught her how to manage difficult situations that she now can handle well.  Aydee has customers that always buy from her directly at her home, or on her farmlands while she works her crops.

Kamoliddin has personal goals too. He is planning to use the generated profits to buy a new vehicle and remodel his private house. Kamoliddin is a conscientious and focused manager of his resources and always plans his time and finances. In all his business dealings, he is guided by a sense of trust and goodwill towards others.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 26 years-old and married with one school-aged child. To make a living, Zandra owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, detergents, junk food and toothpaste in the local community. Zandra has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Zandra joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Zandra has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and to provide working capital. Zandra is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell such as canned goods and junk food. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Zandra from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":697539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

ventures:  fishing and food vending.  She lives in the municipality of Medellin, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000. Dima is borrowing PHP 10,000 to continue to fund the operations of her business. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Dima aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Jose es un padre soltero que tiene a su cargo sus 2 hijos debido a que la madre de sus hijos los abandon\u00f3 hace un tiempo. Jose siempre les ha querido ofrecer a sus hijos una educaci\u00f3n de calidad y mayores oportunidades de progreso. Jose se dedica desde los 12 a\u00f1os de edad a la fabricaci\u00f3n de sillas mecedoras, la cual hace con partes de madera y cabuyas de mimbre.

She hopes to invest the loan in fertilizer and the rental of machinery to work the lands. She is hoping that, with the profits, she can finish constructing her home which was left incomplete. She works her part of the land on her own, with little help from her husband who has a separate plot that he rents. She works primarily to educate and feed her children. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n\r\n<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month.

Working six days a week and 13 to 16 hours a day, she earns about 120 USD every month. She is assisted by her husband in the shop. Bupe requires a loan in order to expand and renovate her business.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192587,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher

He has worked many jobs in his lifetime, but none other has given him the satisfaction that running his taxi service does. Pedro operates his taxi in Manhattan from 42nd Street and below, driving clients all over New York City, to and from the airports, and sometimes long distances to other cities along the eastern seaboard. He has been married for 30 years, has a grown daughter, and is also a proud grandfather.\r\n\r\n<P>The dispatch company for which Pedro operates his taxi requires him to purchase a new vehicle every ten years. Pedro currently drives a 1998 with more than 397,000 miles, so he has come to ACCION USA for a loan to purchase a new vehicle. In addition to allowing him to continue working for his current dispatch company, the new taxi will provide a more comfortable ride for his clients. Pedro is a long-time client of ACCION USA. He has received several loans in the past and has always repaid on time.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>He has plans to rent his old taxi to a cousin who can use it with another dispatch service in New York City.

Oneida is well known for her friendly, trustworthy and accessible nature, which means that she is well liked, particularly by her customers as she has a clothes-selling business for ladies, men and children. Oneida started her business as she was looking for something that would increase her earnings whilst still being able to care for her children.\r\n\r\nOneida grew her business by \u201cselling small items\u201d, which she had bought on offer or discount, to neighbours and family members. Gradually, her perseverance, able management, and loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n allowed her to increase her income. This current loan from credikiva will be used to buy blouses, footwear, jeans and general men\u2019s, women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing for the purposes of Valentine\u2019s Day, which is coming up and people wish to look nice and buy gifts for their partners and loved ones.   \r\n\r\nOneida\u2019s business has allowed her to improve her standard of living and turn her home into a pleasant environment. Initially her house started out as a plot of land but has gradually been improved upon. Oneida lives in a neighbourhood in the south of Barranquilla with her two children ages 21 and 25 years. She has managed to put her children through school using the loans provided by the Fundaci\u00f3n.\r\n\r\nOne of her children is a technician and the other is studying at a university. Oneida\u2019s dream is for her children to become fully professional in order to be able to compete in the job market. Oneida\u2019s most notable challenge is to continue to make ends meet but she is always keen to adopt new strategies to be able to build her client base and protect her earnings.      \r\n\r\n<br

It is because of this that she is able to contribute to the running of her household. Three months ago, she began making woven baskets because she realized that this would also be profitable. The demand for these baskets has been very strong and they need to been made in large quantities to meet the demand - particularly from tomato producers. To suitably meet the demand of people wanting to buy her baskets, Mrs A. needs some financial support.

He is very proud of his lands, as they are very fertile and they have helped him and his family survive for years. He lives with his mother and father, and they hope to invest in fertilizer and pesticides for their crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

A lot of people who hear about microfinance (or kiva.org) for the first time ask anxiously, \u201cbut how do you make sure people pay back?  Won\u2019t they just take the money?\u201d  The implication is that the clientele who access microfinance (usually the poor) are less trustworthy, efficient or educated than \u2018ordinary\u2019 people.  Whether or not this is true is somewhat irrelevant for a number of reasons.  \r\n\r\nFirstly, most MFIs have due diligence processes in place to assess client risk, as well as measures such as collateral arrangements and group lending (where a defaulted loan is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk.  More important than any of these deterrents, however, is an incentive.  The incentive is for clients to be able to start a business, build a business, and repay their loan so that they can get another and another and another\u2026 The incentive is to have on-going access to financial services from which they had previously been excluded.\r\n\r\nTwawiya began this journey in 2002 when she opened a shop selling a variety of foodstuffs.  Since then, she has received and repaid four loans of progressively increasing amounts from SELFINA, which she has used to expand her business.  Twawiya now purchases all her stock in bulk, which has enabled her to increase her profits.  \r\n\r\nThis time, Twawiya requires a loan of $1075 to purchase stocks of soda, flour and sugar.  Her business makes it possible for Twawiya to provide for her three daughters - Corona, 12, Caroline, 9, Theresa, 6 - and her niece, Elizabeth, aged 10.\r\n\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facilities as a practical way to achieve economic and social emancipation of women.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro Leasing.  Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets.  This leads to poor financial support, which in turn leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys from and leases equipment to women.  Where a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from the said client extending a loan to her, and then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a \"sale and leaseback arrangement\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":100675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He is retired in the eyes of the government following thirty years working in a textiles factory. However, he prefers to spend his time working rather than resting at home. This is why, for five years, in the mornings, he has been selling sweets from a wheelbarrow outside a school. He decided to go into this line of work as he already had some experience in the field. Before working in the textiles factory he worked for several other people selling sweets. Of course, he was selling from something a bit bigger than a wheelbarrow in those days. On the other hand, in his house he also sells fizzy drinks, as well as other types of soft drink. He plans to work as long as his health allows him to, which is why he is looking to invest more money into his business.

As Mrs. L. is a skilled tailor, her shop is very popular in her area. Realizing that she still had time to do something else besides tailoring, Mrs. L. started using the loans from TYM Fund to open a small shop selling a variety of necessities at home in 2003. This has helped her family make about 3.000.000 VND per month. Her husband sends money back home every month to help the whole family. In the next round of loan, Mrs. L. would like to borrow 10.000.000 VND ($625) to purchase more goods for her shop.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

K. is 26 years old, married, and has one child aged four and half years old. Her business is located at Muthurwa, a very busy open-air market on the outskirts of Nairobi city centre. She sells clothes and CDs to walk-in customers. She has been in this business for the last three years. Naomi says that business is very good and profitable. The only major challenge she has is that there are so many people in the area operating the same kind of business so customers are spoiled for choice. However, Naomi works very hard from early morning to late evening to ensure that her business does well.

He lives with his wife Sara and their three young children who he looks after, educates and raises in his own home which is located in the village of Cumutay.\r\n\r\nThe pillar of Antonio's life is farming and although he sometimes has his ups and downs and complications he continues to get ahead in life.  He has been a farmer for 35 years.  His main crops are potatoes, peas, 'olluco' and 'oca' (these last two being native tubers).  He looks after his crops and fertilizes them every weekend since he also works for a construction company which is building a hydroelectric power station in the area.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that Antonio doesn't have much time, he hopes to produce good quality crops in his next harvest.  This will require a lot of hard work since they need more looking after during rainy periods.  He would like, in the future, to obtain more farming land and to increase his production.\r\n\r\nThis is Antonio's sixth loan with MFP and he is certain that he will continue working actively and responsibly with his community bank.

She started her business three years ago and she likes making skirts, blouses, dresses, and dance outfits for schools.  She also adds zippers.  She did not study sewing formally, but she worked for another lady who had a workshop, adding zippers, for six months.  She also repaired skirts and she liked it and thought about starting her own workshop so that she would not feel alone.  Her business is important because she likes making skirts and blouses, and it\u2019s well known for its good prices and quality.  She uses the earnings to pay for water and electricity.  Her hopes and dreams are, God willing, to start an amusement business, including sweets and ice cream, and that her children remain well in their health and work.\r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s members would like to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cWe appreciate your support.

The ability to purchase more items and get a new refrigerator to keep groceries fresh will help Yelena meet the high demand for these food items.

This is 45-year-old Edina S.. She is married and has four children aged between 13 and 27. In 2001, Edina established her red palm oil business. She opens her business six days a week and nine to twelve hours a day. Edina requires a loan in order to buy more red palm for extracting oil. She thanks you for your support. \r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for S. client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more redpalm for extracting oil.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:40:43Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edina L.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:56:46Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356215},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:50Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347968},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:16Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970542},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886759},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436019}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:56:46Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65479,"name":"Le Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Mrs. Le Thi K., aged 50, has been in TYM Fund since 2003.

Due to the fact that she did not attend secondary school, and in an attempt to be financially independent, for the past two years Betty has sold candy. She has a three-wheeled cart from which she sells candy of various types.  Her customers return regularly to buy her sweets.  Betty generally works from 9:00 in the morning till evening, because sales are good.  The difficulty is the need to spent almost the entire day attending to business, but for Betty this is minor because she enjoys what she does.  Her desire is to ensure her financial stability so that in the future she might be able to have a family.  With the money that she has requested she wants to buy more candy and to better equip her cart.

The oldest attends preschool. <p>\r\nAfter completing the 10th grade, he enrolls in a teacher's development course where he was not admitted. Years later he leaves Inhambane for Maputo where his father worked. His father had divorced his mother. When he arrives in Maputo he gets a job in the civil registry. His good performance allowed for his promotion to technical assistant and consequent transfer to Namaacha, a town on the Swaziland border. He has worked for more than 10 years and receives 3257.00mt monthly, a salary that does not allow for a basic living standard. His desire to build his own house has lead him to ask for a loan in order to begin construction 75km outside of Namaacha. <p>\r\nAlong with his children he is responsible for the care of his mother with whom he resides in Chimoio.

Abduzabi is 50 years old. He is married with two children. Since he was young he has been in the business of raising and selling cattle which is why he has a lot of experience. It is necessary to point out that Abduzabi has been able to succeed thanks to the support provided by IMON International. This support has been in the form of a loan which he has used to purchase and raise young bulls in their locality. Today Abduzabi has once again come to IMON International for a loan which will allow him to purchase young bulls to raise and sell. It is his biggest dream to improve the conditions of his business in order to then improve the conditions of his family.   \n \nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The women live in the town of Cuenca but are natives of Quingeo parish located to the south-east of the canton of Cuenca. To the north is the parish of Santa Ana, to the south the parish of San Jos\u00e9 de Raranga of S\u00edgsig canton, and to the west the parishes of Cumbe and Tarqui. Most of the inhabitants work in agriculture and cattle raising, but as well they grow corn, potatoes, beans and barley. Growing flowers is a new and lucrative venture. Cattle raising is important in the lower areas especially for the production of milk. As soon as boys reach working age, they move to Cuenca to take up jobs as construction workers, or as factory workers, artisans of different types, or in various business or transportation ventures. A good number of the women have jobs as domestic servants.\r\n\r\nRosa B. lives on the outskirts of Cuenca but is a native of Quingeo parish. She moved to the city in search of better work opportunities and to help her family get ahead. She is 22 years old, single, and lives with her parents. She contributes very little to household expenses as they have to pay rent, but back in their community they own their own house. Rosa has been selling vegetables for three years in the Feria Libre market. She works on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from 5am to 6pm. The other days she cleans houses from 7am to 5pm. This is Rosa\u2019s second loan cycle and she wishes to use the money to buy tomatoes, onions, peppers, carrots, chard, and other vegetables for her business. Her goal is to expand into other products and thus improve service to her customers.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Lilia Jim\u00e9nez is an entreprising member of the group who is always seeking a better life. She sells earrings, hair accessories, head bands etc., work she\u2019s been doing for nine years. She has her own stall in the 10 de Agosto market where her children also help to sell the merchandise. She works from 8am to 2pm, seven days a week.\r\n\r\nLilia is 39 years old and lives with her partner. They have three children aged 19, 11, and 7. Her oldest son helps with the business, and the two younger children attend school in the town. Her husband is a taxi driver. As they do not own a house, they live in rented accommodation. This is Lilia\u2019s first loan. She was invited to join this team of hardworking women by a friend. With the money she will buy earrings, hair accessories, buttons, etc to better stock her business. Her goal is to buy a vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":541559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy vegetables and hair accessories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Olga Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rosario Del Cisne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilia Eudalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rosa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":183.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":549.99,"local_amount":549.99,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:09Z","rounded_local_amount":549.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892479},{"amount":366.66,"local_amount":366.66,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":366.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632825},{"amount":549.99,"local_amount":549.99,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":549.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846859},{"amount":366.66,"local_amount":366.66,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":366.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113338},{"amount":366.7,"local_amount":366.7,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406905}],"funded_date":"2010-06-21T05:51:04Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:59:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":205633,"name":"Ekua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ekua R. has nine dependants.

to provide satisfactory services to her regular customers by fulfilling their orders without delay. She wishes to access a larger loan to expand her handicraft business so she can earn more profits. \r\n\r\nPrior to ASHI, Merlinda had no access to capital to support her entrepreneurial dreams. She joined ASHI to follow her dreams of providing a decent life for her family. To fulfill this inspiration, she took out a loan and started her own handicraft business. As she continued to take loans from ASHI and save some of her profits, she was able to grow her business. Many souvenir shop owners visit Merlinda's village to purchase her products. Other customers are Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) wanting to buy presents for their colleagues abroad. With the loan, Merlinda has noticed that her weekly income has almost doubled since she has attracted new customers with additional inventory.\r\n\r\nNow she is proposing another loan of 20,000 Philippine pesos to support maintenance of her business and purchase inventory of raw materials needed for her handicraft. With the support of ASHI and Kiva, she is hopeful that her business will generate steady income to improve her financial stability and her family\u2019s standard of living and support the education of her 2 children until they are complete degree holders.

She is married to Juan, 46, and their union has yielded 3 children.  They live in their own home in the Canal community, part of the Samugari district.  Ercelia\u2019s work involves tending to land where she grows cacao, coffee and citrus.  She does her work at the side her husband, who also works hard to generate income for the family.\r\n\r\nShe has found it convenient to take her products to the city of San Francisco where, as she tells us, she can get better prices for her goods.  When her workload increases, she has no problem finding migrant laborers to help her out.  What she enjoys most about her work is protecting the crops against plagues that threaten productivity.\r\n\r\nShe has been in farming for 20 years, and finds the most difficult aspect to be transporting her products.  The trip from her farm to her community is long and tiring, but this is where the drying of her respective products takes place.  In the future, she would like to buy additional lands in order to increase productivity.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.  She hopes to be very punctual with her payments since she doesn\u2019t want to create any problems for her cooperative bank.  She will use the requested loan to buy sacks of fertilizers to improve her crops. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":763519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"buy sacks of fertilizers for her crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-04T16:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ercelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2056.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245165}],"funded_date":"2011-05-04T21:22:57Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":299884,"name":"Dionesia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dionesia is 56 years old and married with six children.

She lives in her own home with her husband and three children.\r\n\r\nIn search of business opportunities, and at the recommendation of her mother-in-law, Milagros started making oven-roasted suckling pig.  She now has 11 years experience in selling this food.

She then dresses them and prepares them.  Milagros has her own oven where she cooks.  She fills customers' orders for large events and also sells in the markets.  She is helped by her sister-in-law and her mother-in-law who also sell this product.  She considers the business to be very profitable and it rewards the effort that she puts in.  Her wish is to improve and stock her business so that she can prepare better-quality dishes.  \r\n\r\nMilagros has been working with MFP through 17 group loans.  She feels very proud of this.  She shows her commitment by being a member of the board of directors of her community bank.  They have placed their trust in her and she feels very satisfied as a result.  Milagros will invest the money that she has requested in repairing her oven as it has collapsed owing to the bad way in which it was constructed.

He has lived on his lands for about 30 years with his family. He has had two children with his wife; both of them are grown but still contribute to the farm. He hopes to invest the loan in buying seeds, fertilizer and pesticides for the upcoming planting season. His goal afterwards is to make some improvements to his home.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":25998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-13T05:30:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fausto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-27T19:55:09Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-06-16T16:56:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23688},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-07-17T21:37:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33122},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T23:42:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71904},{"amount":378,"local_amount":378,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:23:05Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":378,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99065},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2008-05-14T16:45:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210201}],"funded_date":"2007-04-13T19:55:09Z","paid_date":"2008-05-14T16:45:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12235,"name":"Ana Laura","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Senora Ana Laura is a hard-working and honest woman.

Mehri purchases them from farmers who grow vegetables in large green houses.  \r\n\r\nRight now cucumbers and tomatoes are expensive at the market, but people still buy them, because the body has a very large demand for vitamins in the spring.  In 1.5-2 months everyone will have cucumbers and tomatoes ripen in their garden and their price will drop.  This is why Mehri would like to increase her product selection and also sell other fruits and vegetables.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":305137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase product selection","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-18T15:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mehri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":337.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599950},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":337.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994379},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T10:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":337.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215646},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":337.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645139},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":337.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084686},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":337.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000895}],"funded_date":"2009-04-18T16:45:16Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:28:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sabina Holzman","image":36162}},{"id":106467,"name":"Erdenechimeg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erdenechimeg T. is a 50-year-old widowed mother of one.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Her husband, Joben B., who is 38 years-old, works as a laborer and also helps with his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are aged 13 to 18 years -old. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Marissa joined Kiva partner NWTF-Project Dungganon because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past ten loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marissa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to expand her rice and dried fish businesses so that she can continue to save for the future. Marissa B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She has had her business for a year and a half, and she started it by making breakfasts with a loan she took from another company. She plans to use her new loan to invest in her business by buying chairs and tables for her comedor, where she sells breakfast, lunch and dinner. (A comedor is a small restaurant located in a non-commercial area or neighborhood, where people come for lunch or dinner. They are served homemaD. food for a cheaper price than in a restaurant or cafeteria.) Anselma will use her profits to buy a bed and a television. She plans to have a good, successful business because she wants to see her wishes come true and her business is her only hope. \r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because \"I have a business and I need to make my business sustainable\". Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti). Her group is located in Samana, a lush, rugged peninsuL. with a nascent tourism industry. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":599854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is married and has three children. He lives with his family in the community of La Villa en Francisco Morazan. Alex began to raise livestock three years ago, and his father taught him how to do the work. Twice a week he slaughters two cows and sells the meat to buyers who have butcher's shops.

Jovia lacks funds to increase her poultry farm. Jovia is requesting a 60,000 KES loan to buy poultry. Her loan will help her to sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and the local market. This will translate into increased profit and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, Jovia intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry business to other markets. She will use the profit from her loan to repay her loan, permanently change her living conditions, and secure the future of her six school-going children. \nHelp Jovia to start off on the right foot in her poultry business and let her improve her life.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed uncreditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

She currently has a small caf\u00e9 shop, selling beer and soft drinks in Dong Tam, Ninh Giang town, Hai Duong province. With the assistance of her husband, the caf\u00e9 has been going very well. In addition to selling beer in her caf\u00e9, she supplies it to other caf\u00e9 shops in her town, so her family\u2019s income has been relatively stable. With a monthly income of 4.000.000 VND, Mrs. C. is very on time in paying back her loans. In the next round of loan, Mrs. C. would like to borrow 20.000.000 VND ($1200) to stock more beer for her own caf\u00e9 as well as to sell it for other shops in her area, thereby earning more money to send her kids to good schools. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Khoa Nguyen, Kiva

He started cultivating his small parcel of land in 2004, the harvest being used primarily for family consumption with the remainder sold in the market. Currently Gafurjon is asking for a loan of 2000 Somoni to purchase high quality seeds and fertilizer for his crop. He and his family sincerely thank Kiva and its lenders.  <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes:  its role as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

As parents, Josephine and Valentino want all of their children to finish their studies and find stable jobs someday. \r\n\r\nFarming is their main source of income. Their crops include rice, vegetables and corn. To assist her husband in providing for the needs of their family, Josephine decided to begin selling fish, meat and vegetables in their village. With a small amount of capital, she was then able to start her own business in the public market of Diadi. Through her patience and sacrifices, she earns a net income of PHP 700 a week, which she carefully budgets for the daily needs of their family and the tuition fees and allowances of their children. \r\n\r\nShe wants to borrow PHP 5,000 from the Kiva lenders for the improvement of her business. Through the loan, she can purchase more merchandise that she believes will result in an increased

She plans to use this loan to invest in her business selling clothing and making sheets and curtains. She will do so by purchasing brassieres and panties in the main market in Santiago as well as cloth to sew her sheets and curtains. She will use the profits to invest in her business by constructing a commercial venue as part of her home and to invest in her family by purchasing school supplies for her children.
