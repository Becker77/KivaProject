","en":"Narzullo is a young man. He is 29 years old, a caring husband and the father of two children. He is a very energetic guy. He is always striving to achieve something in life. He tries to create all the conditions for his children to grow up with a decent life. Previously, Narzullo worked as a bricklayer in a construction crew. But after some time, his health did not permit him to work there. He has a very tight-knit and hard-working family. His wife Munira sews national dresses at home. After her husband lost his job due to the state of his health, the husband and wife took advice to start a new business from home. The business is fattening and buying\/selling sheep and goats. They would buy sheep and goats, fatten them up and resell them. And they received a considerable income. Apart from this, they grow livestock feed which gives them additional income. But this year he was not able to get a good harvest. He wanted to sell part of the feed and use the money received to expand the scale of his livestock rearing. Due to unfavorable weather he did not get the intended harvest, so his plans to sell barley and use the money from the barley to buy livestock did not work out. But despite all this he has always strived to expand the size of his business, and he has applied to MDO Arvand with the aim of receiving a loan. Narzullo will buy sheep and goats using the received loan that he is going to resell for double the money in future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":188.09,"image":{"id":1902378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy some livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-06-13T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-13T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narzullo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":283.71},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":279.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":286.08},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":307.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":301.57},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":331.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":336.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":342.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":364.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":373.29},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":386.31},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":406.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.82},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.74},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.17},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.66},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.78},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.1,"local_amount":283.71,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-01T12:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":288.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696605126},{"amount":45.5,"local_amount":279.98,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-20T12:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":284.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711524634},{"amount":46.49,"local_amount":286.08,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":291.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731040475},{"amount":50,"local_amount":307.72,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:14:45Z","rounded_local_amount":313.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755520146}],"funded_date":"2015-07-13T14:32:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":895226,"name":"Mar\u00eda Elena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria es una mujer de 39 a\u00f1os es casada cuenta con una linda familia de  ocho hijos de las edades entre 7 y 22 a\u00f1os de edad, esta humilde familia vive en una comunidad de Chichicastenango.\nMaria con el af\u00e1n de generar sus ingresos y apoyar a su esposo con los gastos de su casa se dedica a la compra y venta de pescado seco, este negocio lo tiene ella desde hace quince a\u00f1os y para mejorar sus ingresos tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de ropa t\u00edpica.\nMaria gracias a la amabilidad con la que atiende a sus clientes, su negocio cuenta con mucha clientela, por tal raz\u00f3n ella solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra y venta de pescado seco y as\u00ed poder satisfacer mejor las necesidades de los clientes.\nEl gran sue\u00f1o de Maria es poder mejorar sus ingresos y darle lo mejor a su familia.\n","en":"Maria is a 39 year old married woman who has a beautiful family of eight children between the ages of 7 and 22 years old.

kind-hearted and hard-working 46-year-old man. He is married and has two children. Lutfullo and his family live in a rural village. In order to earn a living, Lutfullo runs his own business. He has been growing crops for fifteen years. Then, when he gathers the harvest, he takes it to a large market and sells it there. He used to work on a farm and then decided to sell his own crops. He also works as a builder for additional income. He has a few heads of cattle which he is rearing for sale later. Now Lutfullo wants to expand the crop growing part of his business, but he has insufficient funds at present to buy mineral fertilizer. He has therefore applied to Arvand and wants to take a loan to buy the mineral fertilizer. Lutfullo very much hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for its support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1899150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy mineral fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-06-13T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-13T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lutfullo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":266.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":289.31},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":291.01},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":301.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":315.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":325.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":334.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":346.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":361.7},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":370.94},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":384.88},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":412.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.24},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.78},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.54},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":895228,"name":"Jos\u00e9","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jose es un hombre  que le agradece mucho el apoyo brindado  pues gracias al cr\u00e9dito el puedo comprar sus semillas de ma\u00edz y abono qu\u00edmico, pues gracias a Dios obtuvo muy buena cosecha y con la ganancias que genero logro remodelar su casa.

He is married and has two children. Mirzorahmat and has family live in a rural village. Mirzorahmat runs his own business in order to earn a living. He has been growing crops for ten years. When he gathers the harvest he takes it to a large market and sells it there. He previously worked on a farm and then decided to sell his own crops. He has a few heads of cattle which he is rearing for sale in future. Now Mirzorahmat wants to expand the crop growing part of his business, but he does not have enough of his own money to buy mineral fertilizer.

She lives in the urban commune of Antsirabe in the highlands of Madagascar with her husband and three sons. In order to meet her family's needs, she had to change her line of work. Two years ago, she started selling her own wares. She offers her customers various day-to-day items and accessories, such as batteries, cosmetic products, domestic items and dry goods. She mainly carries out her business as a wandering street vendor and places herself in strategic positions depending on crowd numbers and special events, such as festivals and large gatherings.\r\n\r\nJulienne requested assistance from Vahatra to start up her business two years ago. She has also succeeded in making a distinct increase in her capital and has built up some savings. With this new loan, she plans on diversifying the products she offers by purchasing torch lamps (500), padlocks (20) and cigarette lighters (20), as well as offering her customers a wider selection of goods. Julienne's priorities are still ensuring that her family's needs are meet by assuring her children's current and future well-being as best she can.

Mother Mary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. \r\n\r\nAnne ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1901556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system and provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Iganga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.609167 33.468611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-06-13T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-13T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.35,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mother Mary School","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3035000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":192.65,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":620001.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.35,"payment_id":696580906},{"amount":200,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":620001.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755507225}],"funded_date":"2015-06-14T09:02:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nathan Tichenor","image":28733}},{"id":899642,"name":"Gauri","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gauri is a hardworking married woman from Raychenga, a small village in district Alipurduar in West Bengal.

Her opinion is that this income is not sufficient to maintain her family and hence there are almost zero surpluses at the end of the month. \r\n\r\nShe planned to improve her business by  means of a loan, which resulted in taking the loan, and she will purchase a picot sewing machine from the local market.

Frequent distribution of relief goods to Haiyan-affected communities almost crushed the variety stores, because the commodities that the people need every day were supplied to them through relief goods. It was several months after Haiyan when variety stores rose again. \r\n\r\nCorazon is one of those variety-store owners. Not only Haiyan affected her business. Her income diminishes also during school breaks or vacations. Now that the school has already begun, she needs additional capital to buy more stocks of grocery items and dry goods for sale in her variety store. This includes cookies, chips, candies, canned goods, sachets of toiletries, juice, soft drinks, beverages, and many others. She implores you for your kind support for a loan of PHP 30,000 to enable her to buy all of these items. May you be God\u2019s blessing to her as she aspires for a bigger and more successful business.  \r\n\r\nCorazon is married to Nelson and they have children. They work hard to support their daily expenses and children\u2019s education.

Almost all businesses in those areas dwindled or were bankrupted.

Frequent distribution of relief goods to Haiyan affected communities almost crushed the variety stores, because the commodities that the people need everyday were supplied to them through relief goods. It was several months after Haiyan that variety stores rose again. \r\n\r\nBabylin is one of those variety store owners. Not only Haiyan affected her business. Her income diminishes also during school breaks or vacations. Now that school has already begun, she needs more stocks of variety store items like cookies, chips, candies, canned goods, sachets of toiletries, juice, soft drinks, beverages, and many others. She also plans to buy a refrigerator so she can have more bottled drinks for sale. She implores your kind support to enable her to buy all these needs in the amount of PHP 50,000. May you be God\u2019s blessing to her as she aspires to improve her business.\r\n\r\nBabylin is a devoted member of CCT Credit Cooperative and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Customers keep coming back again and again due to its savory taste and aroma. This may be the reason why chicken inasal is one of the iconic products of these provinces. \r\n\r\nAireen, 41, a resident of Barotac Viejo, Iloilo, chose the right business to venture into. She has run a chicken barbeque stand for almost twenty years and employs two helpers. Her husband, Wilfredo, also a food vendor, helps her in her business. They have three children to whom they want to dedicate all their efforts. The couple work hard to support their children\u2019s education until its completion. It\u2019s their aspiration to improve the quality of living for them. However sometimes they struggle financially if the income from their business becomes unstable. Due to proliferation of many barbeque stands in the area, the competition gets stiff. Aireen longs to run her business consistently to gain a better and steady income. You might be a blessing to her through this PHP 17,000 loan that she will use to buy additional ingredients for her chicken barbeque business. It will not just provide for their everyday needs but it will also boost her savings for her children\u2019s future and education.

a widow, and she has one son.  She works as a consulting physician in a pharmacy.  As an additional source of income for her family she has been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture since 1995.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has eight cows and 80 sheep on her farm.  She also grows alfalfa for resale on one hectare of land.

Chorkor-Accra, Ghana and is a group of two very active women who, above all, want to better their quality of life. They are selling sandals and rice. Charllote is 44 years old and a married woman of one child, 2 years old. She is a member of the group and is very excited to begin a tenth loan cycle. Charllote sells rice. Her business income is able only to pay for the costs of maintaining her home. She is requesting a new loan in order to buy different bags sizes of rice to cover all of her customer demand because without more investment capital, she feels that her own income is not sufficient. \r\n\r\nBesides the loans, Charllote and the other members of trust in God also benefit from a combination of loans and education (training). The loan officer and the training officer share timely and useful information with the members on a variety of subjects like health, hygiene, and nutrition as well as self-esteem and violence against women. The members learn about effective business management practices and customer service, as well as gaining essential knowledge about business planning, customer service, marketing and pricing. All of these subjects help them better their lives both economically and developmentally."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":721.92,"image":{"id":1901849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy different bags sizes of rice and also sandals to cover all of her customer demand.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Chorkor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":231,"posted_date":"2015-06-14T08:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-14T08:00:05Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yesme","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charlotte","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":145.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":255.37,"local_amount":1083.38,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1084,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696578640},{"amount":157.15,"local_amount":666.7,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":667.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711495398},{"amount":132.87,"local_amount":563.68,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":564,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731013687},{"amount":176.53,"local_amount":748.88,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-20T13:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":749.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":753649160}],"funded_date":"2015-07-03T14:53:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":899898,"name":"Jonalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jonalyn is a married woman with seven children.

She is married to Arnold, a customer representative, and they are blessed with three children. One is in in high school and the other two are in the elementary level. The couple work hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs and to send their children to school. \r\n\r\nJacqueline has a small school\/office supplies store. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also sells mineral water by the gallon for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 700 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan that she will use to buy more school supplies such as pad paper, pencils, bond, art, cartolina paper, staple wire, folders, envelopes, etc. to sell at retail prices and meet the regular needs of the students, especially now that school year has started in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is positive that the loan will boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial assistance, for it will surely help cover their daily sustenance and the school needs of her children.\r\n\r\nJacqueline hopes to expand her business so her family can have a better life. She strives hard to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life.
