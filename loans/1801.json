She offers a large variety of ophthalmic solutions aimed at each segment of the population that lives in the Soledad municipality. This provides a guarantee and support for her investment in visual health. Her business started with clothing and shoe sales. She still does this. However, it seemed like a good idea to buy some cabinets to display frames and to offer vision exams, prescription lenses, and repairs for broken glasses.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she has nine years of experience and she hopes to invest in buying a new supply of frames, lenses, and clothing in general.

But realistically, she is aware that the amount she must save should be much more, if she has to provide a complete education for her daughter and improve her family\u2019s living standards. \r\n\r\nSo, Sumana plans to build on her milk business by buying an extra cow. The extra milk from the cow will bring in an extra income per month. It will be a key step towards Sumana's goal of earning more, saving better, and achieving the financial independence to provide a good future for her daughter. So she is seeking a loan from BJS to buy the cow. \r\n\r\nShe appreciates her lenders' support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1902469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy a cow for her milk-supplying business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Falakata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2015-06-14T23:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-14T23:50:03Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sumana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-06-15T00:42:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":900081,"name":"Manasa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manasa is a resident of Muniguda village of Rayagada district, Odisha, India.

Most of the inhabitants here are very hardworking and earn their living from the sea. <br \/><br \/>Here we meet Rosa, 28, who is married and has three children, ages 9, 8 and 6 years old. They are all in school. Her husband is a fisherman. Rosa is asking for a loan for his husband to use for his work. Alone or with a partner, he goes out every morning in a small rowboat. He only fishes close to the beach because it would be very dangerous to go out too far in his rowboat. He gets what he can from this part of the sea, and although the fish are small they sell well.

No doubt she has everything as per the requirements of the basic necessities of life, different activities with a permanent income, a three-wheeler, a good shop, and other allied items to manage her family. Still, her family members are not so happy due to the non-availability of a good RCC (reinforced concrete) house that they own.<br \/><br \/>It doesn\u2019t mean that they are staying at a thatched house; rather, they are staying at a rented house with a high rate of rent. The rented house is made from mud and roofed with asbestos, which creates a very critical situation during the rainy season. The most important cause of apprehension is that the house is not completely secure and safe. <br \/><br \/>In this situation, she decided to construct a small, but standard house with all possible facilities.

All of the activities provide a monthly profit of 21,000 som (KGS) which is not enough for her and the kids. \r\n\r\nExpecting a high profitability of agricultural activities, Baktygul turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) to buy livestock. She plans to invest the borrowed money to increase the livestock and improve her family\u2019s living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1165.19,"image":{"id":1904183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"for buy more livestock in order to increase her income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bashkayindy village, Naryn region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-06-15T00:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-15T00:40:04Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":32.52,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Baktygul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":11202},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10946},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":11265},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":11594},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":11932},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":12280},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":12638},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":13006},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":13386},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":13776},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":14178},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":13797}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.57},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.9},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.66},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":372.83,"local_amount":22148,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:54:11Z","rounded_local_amount":22189.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291718},{"amount":189.63,"local_amount":11265,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:55:41Z","rounded_local_amount":11286,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696501023},{"amount":190.32,"local_amount":11594,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":11615.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.85,"payment_id":711411950},{"amount":191.76,"local_amount":11932,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":11954.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.09,"payment_id":730934170},{"amount":188.13,"local_amount":12280,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":12302.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.58,"payment_id":752026255}],"funded_date":"2015-06-19T10:42:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Idaliya Grigoryeva","image":1834671}},{"id":900160,"name":"Selime","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Selime is a widow and a mother of three.

Being staple food in the region, the demand for this crop has always been good. \r\n\r\nSwarnabala needs financial help to purchase agricultural inputs for paddy cultivation. This is why Swarnabala is asking for a business loan from Kiva's field partner Belghoria Janakalyan Samity. The loan will be used to purchase good quality paddy seeds, fertilizers, manure, pesticides and other such resources.\r\n\r\nSwarnabala believes that good produce will take care of her financial expenses for the rest of the year.

It is a good alternative for Filipinos when rice is unavailable. So, Nilda has chosen corn for her business. By now, she has been selling corn for years. She is 52 years of age and a resident of Intramuros, Manila, Philippines. She works hand in hand with her husband, Domingo, to support and equip their household. \r\n\r\nNilda buys raw corn on a wholesale basis at first. Then basically what she does every day is push her cart to where corn is being put inside large pans of hot water. There, corn is being cooked. Usually each corn costs 10 to 15 Philippine pesos (PHP). From this, she makes only an average profit, but it\u2019s not stable since customers vary from time to time. \r\n\r\nNilda is asking for a 30,000 PHP loan to buy additional raw corn for her business.

Having an established business and permanent income, her family members still are not happy. Why? Due to the non-availability of at least a good house that they own.<br \/><br \/>It doesn\u2019t means that they are staying at an open place, but they are staying at a rented house with a high rate of rent charged by the house owner. The rented house is made from mud and is roofed with thatch, which creates very critical situation during the rainy season. It is also very critical to stay during the winter period. The most important cause of apprehension is that the house is not completely secure and safe.<br \/><br \/>In this situation, she decided to construct at least a house roofed with asbestos for a good standard. She has already started to construct the house, but she does not have sufficient funds to complete it. So, she decided to borrow a loan from any bank or other financial institution. At this moment, Sasmita came to Mahashakti Foundation to learn about house loan details. Mahashakti Foundation decided to disburse a loan for house construction. <br \/><br \/>From the loan, Sasmita will complete the door, windows, plastering, flooring, and colouring the house. She will also complete the wiring with an electricity connection.<br \/><br \/>She is very happy to know that her house will be completed within a few months.

row and pointing his right hand up in the photo. The other farmers in the group are Anto, Subhan, Ari, Madi, Ito, Gatot, Mui, Sam and Khoirul. They are posing on an unfinished bio-digester. Mono has a family with one child. All of them live in a small village in Rembang, the northern coast region of Central Java, Indonesia.\r\n\r\nIn his daily life, Mono works as a teacher at a local Elementary School. He also has been running a small-scale vegetable farm. Six months ago, he invited nine of his colleagues to start a cow-fattening business. His business is going quite well. Mono was concerned to see that many young people in his village would have preferred to become construction workers in the nearby cities, compared to continuing their education or rather than advancing agriculture businesses in their village. However, he is deeply concerned to see a high price and scarcity of non-renewable cooking gas, and the cow dung that is wasted without further processing, which is polluting the water in his village.\r\n\r\nAfter socializing with Yayasan Rumah Energi (YRE) and At-Tayseer Foundation (a local educational foundation \u2013 biogas construction partner of YRE) about the Household Biogas (BIRU) program, Mono saw that biogas is a good solution of his problem. He saw an opportunity to reduce his dependence on non-renewable cooking gas. In addition, he also wants to use bio-slurry (biogas residue) as organic fertilizer for his plants. He is so keen to purchase a bio-digester, but he does not have sufficient capital for it. A loan from Kiva will help Mono and other farmer group members to make it possible.\r\n\r\nHe has an optimism that if he can build a bio-digester, he can use the bio-gas for cooking, and bio-slurry (biogas residue) as fertilizer for his plantation. He hopes that in the future, he can invite all the farmers in his village to use biogas, create new jobs for local people, reduce the rate of urbanization and help his village to become energy and food self-sufficient. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":377.1,"image":{"id":1902224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home

She prefers a GHAPE loan because of low interest rates, convenient repayment intervals and the training that the members receive in marketing and management skills before the loans are disbursed.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":35.04,"image":{"id":1902550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

This farmer group is led by the 41-year-old farmer Tulus, who is standing on the far right and pointing his thumb up in the photo. The other farmers in the group are Gimin, Senen, Tri, Ati and Adi. Tulus has a family with three children. All of them live in a small village in Sleman, Jogjakarta, Indonesia.<br \/><br \/>Tulus strives to improve his family's economic conditions. He has been doing small-scale vegetable farming and has a few cows to be fattened for resale. His business is going quite well. However, he was deeply concerned to see the high price and scarcity of non-renewable cooking gas, and also was seeing the cow dung was wasted without further processing, which pollutes the air with a pungent odor.<br \/><br \/>After introduction by Yayasan Rumah Energi (YRE) and Bina Energy Mandiri Persada, CV (a local business enterprise\/biogas construction partner of YRE) to the Household Biogas (BIRU) program, Tulus saw that biogas is a good solution for his problem. He saw the opportunity to reduce his dependence on non-renewable cooking gas. In addition, he also wants to use bio-slurry (biogas residue) as organic fertilizer for his plants. In order to make it happen, Tulus invited three of his friends above to form a farmer group. He is keen to purchase a bio-digester, but he does not have sufficient capital for it. A loan from Kiva will help him and the other farmer group members to make it possible.<br \/><br \/>Tulus has optimism that if he can build a bio-digester, he can use the bio-gas for cooking, and bio-slurry (biogas residue) as fertilizer on his plantation. He also want to sell the remaining bio-slurry to increase his family income. He hopes that in the future, he can invite all the farmers in his village to use biogas and help his village to become an energy and food self-sufficient village."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":152.09,"image":{"id":1902628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion","Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to build a bio-digester facility and utilize the biogas residue as organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Sleman","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":423,"posted_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:04Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tulus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gimin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Senen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":24000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2000000},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2000000},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2000000},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000},{"due_date":"2016-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000},{"due_date":"2017-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2000000},{"due_date":"2017-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2000000},{"due_date":"2017-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000},{"due_date":"2017-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.09},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.09},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.09},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.08},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.08},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.08},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.08},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.08},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.08},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.08},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":152.09,"local_amount":2000000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T18:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2026507.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731207060}],"funded_date":"2015-06-17T17:18:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":899860,"name":"Cira's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe de  30 membres fait partie du banc villageois qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9e le 16 novembre 2010.

He was born in a rural region and taught to work from a young age. He had five sisters and was the oldest, therefore he had to help his father earn a living to support his family. He got married when he was 20 and now has three wonderful children. He lives with his parents and takes care of them. He works in animal husbandry and currently has four cows and seven rams. His wife sells the milk from the cows at the market, and the rams he fattens then resells. He also works a bit as a plumber, installing sinks and water heaters in bathrooms.\r\n\r\nAbduholik has approached Arvand for a loan because he wants to install plastic windows in his house.

Most of the residents are hardworking people who have jobs in the fishing industry.  <br \/><br \/>Don Segundo lives in this place.  He is 48 years old and his wife died several years ago.  Segundo has three grown children, two of whom still live at home with him.  <br \/><br \/>Sr. Segundo is a hardworking man who likes to improve his life.  He has two boats that he uses for sending out his workers to catch fish.  Segundo has six employees, three for each boat.  The boats are out at sea for two or three days before returning to the beach where Don Segundo sells his catch to the merchants who arrive at the same place.

original owner operator opening its doors in 1979. When the owner, Libby, decided to retire last year, she passed the business on to talented stylist and former employee Alma. Alma, having been hired by Libby at the Chelsea Set straight out of beauty school, says taking ownership of the salon \"closes the circle\" for her. \r\n\r\nShe is now 22 years into her career, having spent her first 16 working under Libby, and when Libby decided to pass the torch, Alma was the first person on her mind. In taking ownership, Alma brought an entirely new feel to the salon, now called Staynd Color. She has brought in more staff, (and more clients along with them) and has a growing reputation around the community for her mastery of the \"balayage\" technique for highlights - a brushstroke which produces a more natural look that doesn't leave obvious roots, even up to 6 months after the client's last hair appointment.\r\n\r\nAlma will use this loan to bolster her working capital and continue to add her new flair to the 36-year-old salon she now calls her own.

He found a job working on the weekends in a graphics shop, and it did not take long for him to discover he had a natural knack for the work they were doing there. <br \/><br \/>After a few months in the shop, he noticed an unfortunate trend: the shop was receiving so many orders that they were facing the choice of either slowing down the turnaround time, lowering the quality, or turning customers away entirely. There just were not enough printers in the shop to meet the demand. <br \/><br \/>Rafael saw a solution to the store's problem, and an opportunity to break into the industry. He developed a proposal to the owner of the shop: he could start his own small business that would take the surplus clients off of their plate.

Due to financial constraints, her husband is not in a suitable position to buy all these above products for reselling purposes. Therefore, Riffat has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

Due to financial constraints, her husband is not in a suitable position to buy all these products for reselling. Therefore, Farah has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her husband to buy all these commodities and will also be helpful for him to earn maximum income to manage his household and business. Farah is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":141.05,"image":{"id":1903419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Moreover, it has different restaurants where the specialty are dishes based on \"mojarra\" (type of sea bream). The region is part of the \"mazahua\" culture, although people over 40 years old maintain their mother tongue. Listening to them makes you want to learn it. \r\n\r\nThe Naranjo group is made of 8 honest and hard-working people who have a common goal: the stability of their families. These are its members: Ivette, who runs a patisserie; Javier, who runs a stationary shop; Evelyn, Gilberta and Jorge, who have a grocery store each; Jos\u00e9, who sells slush; Betsabe, who sells clothes; and Alejandra, who sells shoes. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is known for being a friendly man. He started a family with Claudia 15 years ago and have a young son together. He has worked in different activities, such as sowing, cutting of sugar cane, fishing and sale of \u00a8mojarra\", in order to provide his family with the best. However, he decided to start a business of slush to spend more time with his family. He puts a big ice bar on the table and uses a brush to graze the bar and obtain fine frost. He then pours a delicious syrup of fruity flavors. He also sells glasses, bags, straws and a spicy product (liquid and powder) to meet his clients' preferences. Thanks to his earnings, he has been able to buy a tricycle, which he uses to move around the city offering several types of slush, always with a personal touch. \"I like to be on the streets, to talk to my clients, to meet their expectations and to obtain revenues to change the quality of life of my family for the better\". \r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to buy ice, flavoring, fruits, water, chili, lemon, milk, napkins, glasses and straws. His dream is to start a business where he would sell ice cream, strawberries with cream, natural fruit water and slush, making the most of the high temperatures of the region, that are favorable to sales. \r\n\r\n*The picture was taken in Evelyn's house.
