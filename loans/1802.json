I enjoyed Business Law and Ethics, Leadership and Culture, Organization and Management and Sustainable Living.\r\n\r\n2.\tWhat are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? Please be specific: in which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\nMy short-term goal is to be involved with a company, specifically in logistics or property and construction. I would like to be in the Marketing or Analyst department because this would be a stepping stone on how to market product or services. I would like to operate in Johannesburg, but expand in my work place in Soweto and yes, I would like to travel and when I have my own businesses I can be able to know which cities need more service and reduce unemployment.\r\n\r\n3.\tTell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children?\r\nI am a 22-year-old female, born in TimbiSha and I stay with my mother. I am the first child to my parents and have only one sister from my father's side with another lady. My mother has been a single parent as my father passed away in 2006 June.

He has been an independent entrepreneur for 10 years, and now employs 7 to 8 workers in his workshop. One of the two aspects of his work he enjoys the most is training unskilled workers until they reach a point where he can recommend them for a government certificate. The other is designing machines and seeing that what he designs works. What is amazing about his workshop is that he designed all the tools he uses to make other machines \u2013 and they work!  However he is handicapped by them and needs good sophisticated machinery to speed up his production and make more complex machines.\r\n\r\nSam is asking for a loan to be able to buy tools and machines that will enable him to work more efficiently and develop his business. He has been making large gasifying improved cook stoves to help stop deforestation in Zambia and has orders for many more. These stoves require precision tools that he cannot afford without a loan.

Together the couple\u2019s income is not sufficient to meet the family\u2019s household expenses along with their children\u2019s education costs. \r\n\r\nSo Phuli wants to buy a dairy cow to sell more milk for her family\u2019s financial improvement. She hopes to sell cow dung also in her local area because the rural people use it as fuel for cooking. That is why she requested a loan to Kiva\u2019s partner, BJS. \r\n\r\nShe hopes the profit level will increase and that her family will have a financial stability. In the future she dreams of buying more dairy cows with her profit and enhancing her business.\r\n\r\nPhuli conveys her gratitude to BJS and Kiva.

in his community. He was very curious about biodigesters and decided to invest in this waste-to-energy system in order to save money. Indeed, increasing LP gas prices and the wood his household needs to cook are costly expenses. By inputting his animals' manure into the system, natural bacteria will treat it and transform it into biogas and organic fertilizer. The biogas will be connected directly to the cookstove and boiler in the house, displacing the unsustainable LP gas and wood he used to buy. \r\n\r\nUsing biogas will improve Luciano's family's health situation, as his wife and children will not inhale toxic smoke produced by burning wood anymore. In addition to economic savings, Sistema Biobolsa gives Luciano the opportunity to protect his direct environment by treating the raw manure instead of contaminating water sources and letting it emit dangerous greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nWith his savings, Luciano plans to buy additional animals to expand his farming activities.\r\nThis loan represents 24% of the full cost of the biodigester. The remaining part is being covered by a government subsidy."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1904027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"to purchase a 6m3 Sistema Biobolsa biodigester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Villa del Carbon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":226,"posted_date":"2015-06-16T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-16T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luciano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6843,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6843}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.95,"local_amount":1155,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-22T12:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1165.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696728724},{"amount":152.24,"local_amount":2315,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-27T12:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2336.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731164635},{"amount":71.81,"local_amount":1092,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:22:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1102.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752252404}],"funded_date":"2015-06-17T15:30:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":900449,"name":"Annause","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Annause est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 47 ans.

She decided to join Ruma because she wants to expand her business in technology, as well as give more contribution to her community. Her community sees her as an informative, kind, and trusted mobile provider. \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Yeni needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits to her community.

is 56 and has four children. She has a college education and earns income for her family by raising livestock, which she began 35 years ago. She has eight cows and 51 sheep. Thanks to her hard work, Bazarkul currently earns 33,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to develop her business in the future, Bazarkul applied for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) with Bai Tushum Bank to buy cows and increase her herd. She plans to use the earnings from the loan to invest in expanding her business by buying dairy cows and renovating her house.
