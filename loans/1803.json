Her customers are residents in the neighborhood where she lives in the municipality of San Jacinto in the department of Bolivar.  She sells all kinds of products and accessories, skin care and hair care products, colognes, and a variety of other goods.  She also sells hammocks made by artisans in her region.  Although most of the sales transactions are carried out in cash, one of her sales strategies is to offer easy payment terms to her customers needing credit.

With the little time Ann has, she sells crops from their small farm and also keeps dairy cows and poultry. \n\nFrom Kiva lenders, Ann is seeking a loan worth 40,000 KES to pay for seedlings in order to grow more crops. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, as evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to give Ann access to a loan that will aid her in growing her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increasing employment opportunities, and bringing about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. \n\nWith your loan, Ann\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":104.36,"image":{"id":1889341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to grow her horticulture farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-06-17T08:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-17T08:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1720.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1770.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1822.35},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1875.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1930.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1986.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2044.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2104.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2166.18},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2229.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2294.64},{"due_date":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2361.7},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2430.72},{"due_date":"2016-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2501.76},{"due_date":"2016-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2574.87},{"due_date":"2016-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2650.12},{"due_date":"2016-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2727.57},{"due_date":"2016-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2807.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.28},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.36},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.73},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.01},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.69},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.38},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.09},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.58},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.36},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.16},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.98},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.52,"local_amount":2025.83,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2086.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378772},{"amount":18.22,"local_amount":1715.1,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1766.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588486},{"amount":21.89,"local_amount":2060.5,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:54:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2121.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506778},{"amount":20.07,"local_amount":1889.11,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1945.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023595},{"amount":22.66,"local_amount":2133.15,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2196.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111748}],"funded_date":"2015-06-17T20:14:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":901789,"name":"La Promesse Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ali a appris de ses parents que la culture du riz \u00e9tait rentable par rapport \u00e0 d'autres et cela leur permettaient de r\u00e9soudre plusieurs probl\u00e8mes familiaux, tels que la scolarisation, habitat et soins de sant\u00e9.

She has a 2-year-old son. She sells sodas.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, a good listener, and an enterprising, supportive, strong, responsible and hardworking woman. Her business is located in the \u201cVirgen del Lujan\u201d neighborhood, located in the center, with many commercial and public establishments. It has subtropical weather and a temperature that ranges between 21 and 35 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nKatherin has a dark complexion and brown eyes. She is short and has long black hair tied back. She is medium size and her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed. She speaks it at home and speaks Spanish due to cultural and professional reasons. She is the second one standing from right to left, and is wearing pink stockings and a shirt with horizontal stripes.\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with a son who is not of school age yet. They live in a humble room guarded by fragile mud walls, a roof covered with old tiles and brick floor. It is served with potable water, electricity and sewage. She dreams of offering her son a better future, so she started a communal bank with members that work selling fish, as locksmiths, making baby clothes, as bakers, selling fruits, selling noodles, repairing TV sets and selling chicken, in order to apply for a loan to improve their businesses.\r\n\r\nShe works selling sodas. She starts very early in the morning to enjoy the fresh morning air and make her first sales. She works every day under an umbrella located outdoors. \u201cI sell sodas at room temperature and also ice-cold. My customers give me some coins and then leave,\u201d she says. The advantage she has is that under the hot weather, sales are continuous.

The household income is INR 10,000 which is insufficient to meet household expenses and pay for the children's education. The monthly savings are just INR 2,000. \n\nHence Mumtajben thought of starting her business to supplement the family income. She started her variety store which includes bangles, earrings, necklace etc. With this business she is currently earning INR 5,000. But she wants to earn more to support her children's education. Hence she came up with the idea to avail herself of a loan to expand her business. \n\nShe got together with 4 other women who share similar interests. The other women are determined to help their families and want to expand their existing business. These families on average earn INR 10,000 a month out of which they are able to save only INR 2,000. \n\nSimilar to Mumtajben, Zahedabibi is into selling bangles, earrings, necklace etc. She will use the loan to expand her variety store and earn more income. Nilofar, Nargisbanu and Rehana are into selling garments. They sell sarees, blouses, dupattas, leggings etc. and they will use the loan to expand their garments businesses. \n\nTogether the group seeks a loan of INR 70,000. Your loan will help these women earn more and give a good education to their children. It will also pave way for a good standard of living and happiness among these families."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":458.35,"image":{"id":1888361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To expand a retail jewelry store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dahod","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":428,"posted_date":"2015-06-17T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-17T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilofar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nargisbanu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mumtajben","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rehana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zahedabibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":5833.33,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:22:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5866.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681398542},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":5833.33,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:20:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5866.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696608708},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":5833.33,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5866.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711532462},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":5833.33,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5866.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731047006},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":5833.33,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5866.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752135751}],"funded_date":"2015-06-17T18:17:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":894598,"name":"18 De Marzo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Laritza es una mujer de 21 a\u00f1os de edad, soltera, tiene 2 hijos de 1 y 6 a\u00f1os, y su negocio es la sastrer\u00eda.\nElla es buena madre, emprendedora, independiente, constante, optimista, responsable y muy trabajadora.

She is standing on the right, wearing a pink t-shirt and black pants.  She lives in the house of her relatives that work; they live in a small flat built of brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof and brick floor that has potable water, electricity and a sewage system.\r\n\r\nHer desire to get ahead drove her to lead a group of people with businesses like making knitted items, selling fish, construction services, selling empanadas, selling cosmetics, selling seasonal clothing, and making loom-woven items, in order to request a loan and improve their businesses.  Her business is tailoring; the process that she carries out begins with an interview with the client where they select the design, she takes measurements, makes the pattern and proceeds to cut.  Once assembled the details are adjusted and she delivers the garment.  \u201cWe do all kinds of work, adjusting lengths and widths and making clothing, too,\u201d she says.  The advantage of her business is that she has a group of established customers; the disadvantage is the lack of capital to purchase of an industrial sewing machine. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to open a shop to sell her clothing.

Her business is selling fruit.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, generous, kind, selfless, a good woman, responsible and very hardworking. She runs her business the area of 'El Torno' located 32 kilometers southwest. It is one of the most important medium-sized cities; its streets are completely paved and there are modern residential buildings that rise on both sides of the modern two-way highway, where travelers pass on their way to the countryside. \r\n\r\nThe area has a hot, subtropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 21 and 35 degrees Celsius. Sobeida has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair that she wears tied in the back. She is tall and has a robust physique. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which is spoken locally, and she speaks Spanish as part of her general knowledge and for her business (she is seated, holding a light-green bag).\r\n\r\nShe lives her life with her partner, who works as a taxi driver, and their children, who go to school. Her desire to excel prompted her to lead a communal banking group of people with businesses such as sales of cell-phone covers, sales of coca leaf, sales of quinoa juice, sales of alpaca sweaters, sales of skirts, sales of perfumes, sales of soft drinks, cleaning, and sales of ice cream, in order to request loans and improve their activities. Her business is selling fruit such as mandarin oranges, oranges, limes, grapefruit, and lemons, which are the types of fruits produced in the area. In the morning she and her husband use his taxi to deliver the fruit different places such as convenience stores, juicing stands, restaurants, and other customers. In the afternoon she pushes her two-wheeled cart past commercial areas selling fruit in small portions at retail. The fruit is consumed by most people, making her business a profitable activity. \"The fruit is sold daily; in the winter time it is scarce and prices go up ...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she sells daily; the disadvantage is the lack of capital for wholesale trade. Her dream is to sell wholesale fruit; she wants to buy fruit at wholesale to stabilize her business. This is the third round of loans in the two years that they have been with the institution.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Sobeida is requesting a loan to purchase wholesale fruit to stabilize her business and sell at wholesale.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3558.72,"image":{"id":1894710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase wholesale fruit to stabilize her business and sell at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-17T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-17T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":4925,"lender_count":141,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sobeida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemesia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanis Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-08T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":34000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-05T04:00:00Z","amount":3737.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T04:00:00Z","amount":3873.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T04:00:00Z","amount":4014.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T04:00:00Z","amount":4160.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T04:00:00Z","amount":4312.18},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T04:00:00Z","amount":4469.14},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T04:00:00Z","amount":4631.82},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T04:00:00Z","amount":4800.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":561.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.53},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":602.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":624.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":647.37},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":670.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":695.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1684.03,"local_amount":11625.75,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":11636.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554829},{"amount":602.69,"local_amount":4160.73,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4164.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468915},{"amount":624.63,"local_amount":4312.18,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4316.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296749},{"amount":647.37,"local_amount":4469.14,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4473.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076911}],"funded_date":"2015-07-17T13:01:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Philip Hess","image":1178611}},{"id":896405,"name":"Dominga","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cPADRE URRACA\u201d; la socia Dominga alterna sus actividades diarias dedicandose al negocio de venta de autopartes de autos como parabrisas, faros entre otros, la socia agradece el pr\u00e9stamo mediante este medio y del mismo modo se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas en el plazo estipulado, la socia lleva buen tiempo con su negocio el cual le va bien gracias al empe\u00f1o que le pone cada d\u00eda a su negocio, siendo de esta manera que la socia saca adelante a su familia.\nLa socia solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de faros entre otros.\n","en":"The member belongs to the \u201cPADRE URRACA\u201d communal bank.

Her aunt used to tell her stories of different cultures and the meaning of many symbols and crafts. As Rachel started mastering the meaning of art, symbols and their interpretation, she realized that there was more to everything than the stories she was told. Her curiosity drove her to learn more about the ways of her people and many other cultures in Africa and all over the world. When the right time came, Rachel\u2019s family elders approved of her skills and passed on the family business to her.\r\n\r\nRachel sells different crafts and arts such as walking sticks, spears, stone sculptures, traditional musical instruments, traditional necklaces, earrings and many artifacts from various Southern African cultures. She has knowledge of the meaning and interpretation of different symbols crafted on the artifacts. She usually explains the meaning of the art or symbol on the object before selling it to her customers. Word of her experience and uniqueness of the art and crafts she sells has travelled far and many tourists are visiting her stall. \r\n\r\nShe seeks funding to buy more crafts and stone sculptures from different areas of Southern Africa. She is also preparing her three young children to learn the ways of her people and at the same time keep the family business that has been running for generations profitable.\r\n\r\nRachel hopes that a loan from Kiva will help preserve the century-year-old tradition and her family business. Her group members run businesses that are different from Rachel\u2019s business. Their group is called Baruch, and they hope that a Kiva loan will help them improve their businesses so that they can send their children to school.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1166.68,"image":{"id":1900281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To increase her stock of stone sculptures to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-06-17T15:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-17T15:50:04Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosewitter","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rachel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Memory","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamhidza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Iyilesi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":291.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":292,"local_amount":292,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":292,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696747239},{"amount":291,"local_amount":291,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:00:51Z","rounded_local_amount":291,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711678918},{"amount":292.01,"local_amount":292.01,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":292.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731183046},{"amount":291.67,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:51:41Z","rounded_local_amount":291.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752271191}],"funded_date":"2015-06-18T13:39:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":898151,"name":"Key Of Life Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In our modern society, with high costs of living, both husband and wife need to pool resources to provide a decent living for their children. This is the mindset that guides Esther, a married mother of three.  Esther is a tailor who specializes in bedding and school uniforms. Sometimes, she goes to neighboring Mozambique to sell bedding sheets, as there is a good market for them there. For the last nine years, the tailoring business has helped her complement her self-employed husband's income in providing for the needs of the family.\r\n\r\nKey of Life is the name of the group that Esther and three other women in business formed. The women all had a common purpose - to source capital injections for their businesses. The group came to Thrive and attended lessons, gaining business knowledge and a group loan. Esther appreciates the training, as she feels that it has positively impacted her business. She is now able to plan and budget properly, and she puts aside savings for emergencies (as Key of Life saves as a group).

Vendors of all different types stand on either side of the road making the street narrow, forcing cars to move in single file. Large wagons decorated with a collage of vegetables and fruits are parked besides the street, and their owners stand beside them shouting out prices like auctioneers. From the deafening chaos in the market place, one of the voices that calls out to the customers is the voice of Lilian. She advertises her products by calling out to her customers, just as the other vendors in the market do.\r\n\r\nShe sell twine and other packaging materials to tobacco farmers, tobacco buyers and others who need to package their goods.  Lilian intelligently builds relationships with her customers and markets her products to encourage customer loyalty. She even supplies local companies with packaging materials such as orange and potato sacks. She has been able to secure huge orders from her customers in the market. Only a few of these orders have been met; this is because she lacks funding to buy the products in large quantities. \r\n\r\nHer friends have so far encouraged her to take a group loan from Thrive Microfinance. Their group is called Sail Through, which is made up of six hard working women.

This led her to join Tashaina group with three other ladies who are also hardworking and passionate about their businesses. \r\n\r\nLiliosa's desire is to buy a motor vehicle so that movement to her four flea markets is made easier and efficiently.

In the Philippines, sari-sari stores are everywhere. Sari-sari is a Filipino term for variety, and these stores sell a variety of products such as biscuits, candies, canned goods, noodles, toiletries, and many other items that are needed in an individual\u2019s daily living. This is considered as one of the most common businesses built by ordinary people since it provides needed commodities for people.\r\n\r\nAdelaida and her husband have six children. The family lives in Santa Barbara, Iloilo. The income from Adelaida's store helps to provide for her family's daily needs. However, due to competition in this kind of business, her income is unstable. Hence, she decided to venture into hog raising a year ago to bring in additional profit. \r\n\r\nThe initial capital for hog raising is high, just as it was for her sari-sari store. Adelaida built a small pig pen and bought piglets and feed. The return of investment is quite positive in this venture, but it will take several months before she can enjoy it. \r\n\r\nAs of now, she needs to sustain the requirements of her small piggery, as well as her variety store. This is why she is requesting a PhP 20,000 loan. She will use her loan funds partly to buy additional piglets, feed, and vitamins, and partly to buy more products to offer for sale in her variety store. \r\n\r\nIn due time, she hopes that her two enterprises will progress and will give her family a comfortable life. \r\n\r\nAdelaida meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance

She has two children, ages 2 and 7, and her business is selling hardware.  She's dependable, patient, friendly, responsible, and very hardworking, and she's a good mother.\r\n\r\nShe works in the Plan 3000 area located 12 kilometers from the city, an area known for welcoming survivors of the 1983 flood.  The migrants who arrived from the provinces and elsewhere in the country settled in that area (now more than 20% of the population), which has basic services such as health and education.  It's a poor area of subtropical climate with a temperature that varies between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n\r\nGuedy is short, dark, and robust, with brown eyes and long brown hair that she wears tied back.  (She's the third from the right, wearing a brown sweater and blue jeans.)  Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family; she knows Spanish through general knowledge and speaks it for business.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her partner, who works as a vendor, and with her children.  The oldest child attends school and the youngest is not yet old enough for school.  They live in their own home built of brick and cement with a corrugated metal roof and a brick floor; they have potable water, electricity, and gas.\r\n\r\nHer desire for self-improvement inspired her to form a bank of people to request a loan and improve their businesses, which include food sales, sweater sales, construction supplies, baby clothing, fried potato sales, athletic clothing sales, and a neighborhood store.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling hardware such as screws, wire, hammers, saws, and other items.  She works Monday through Friday during the day in her permanent outdoor sales space.  \"Hardware is in some ways a man's world and it's hard for a woman to make her way,\" she said.  The advantage of her business is that she has regular sales.  The disadvantage is the lack of hardware supplies.

She has a business selling traditional food.  She is enterprising, independent, optimistic, responsible, and very hardworking.  Her business is located in the southern part of the city, a place where once a year about 1,000 artisans meet in a  craft fair called \"La Alasita,\" where they offer all types of miniature items for sale.  People buy these miniatures in the hope of obtaining the actual item in the future.  This area has a hot sub-tropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 21-35 degrees Celsius. \r\n\r\nOlga has a dark complexion, dark eyes, long black hard pulled back behind her neck, and a slim physique.  Her native language is Guarani, which she speaks with her family.  She also speaks Spanish in the local culture and in her business.  In the photo she is seen in the center, wearing a short-sleeved white shirt and blue pants. Olga lives with relatives who also work.  They live in their own home built of wood.  The house has a tin roof and earthen floor, and has potable water, electricity and a sewage system.  \r\n\r\nOlga's desire to excel led her to form a communal bank with people who have a variety of businesses, including: selling traditional skirts, selling children's jackets, a welding workshop, auto upholstery, selling juice smoothies, selling cell phone covers, and selling school supplies.  They got together to request a loan to improve their businesses.  Olga has a business selling traditional dishes such as: bone soup, stuffed chicken neck, rice with milk and cheese, and other dishes.  She carries out her business in the areas surrounding her home under a pair of umbrellas that shade the tables and chairs that fill the space outside of her concession stand.  The climate is hot, and the customers request ice and cold drinks that they lack because they don't have a refrigerator.  \"My business constantly grows and the customers grow in number, and I don't have the furniture to serve them,\" she comments.  \r\n\r\nThe advantage of Olga's business is that she has daily and regular customers.  The disadvantage is that she lacks the furniture and kitchen utensils to  serve her customers.  This is the first loan cycle that she has participated in during the 8 years that she has been developing this business. This is why Olga is requesting a loan to buy tables, chairs, and cooking utensils to serve her customers and improve the profitability of her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":1892822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables, chairs, and kitchen utensils","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-17T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-17T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":3300,"lender_count":111,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Mar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marizol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes Vict","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorenzo Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Giorgeli Mey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Brandon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-30T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-13T04:00:00Z","amount":1721.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T04:00:00Z","amount":1723.29},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":1754.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T04:00:00Z","amount":1786.58},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T04:00:00Z","amount":1819.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T04:00:00Z","amount":1852.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T04:00:00Z","amount":1885.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T04:00:00Z","amount":1920.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T04:00:00Z","amount":1955.18},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T04:00:00Z","amount":1990.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T04:00:00Z","amount":2027.01},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T04:00:00Z","amount":2063.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":271.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":276.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":286.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":302.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1024.57,"local_amount":6985.71,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":7028.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344609},{"amount":538.46,"local_amount":3671.31,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3693.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554821},{"amount":558.24,"local_amount":3806.16,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3829.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468907},{"amount":876.03,"local_amount":5972.97,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":6009.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296741},{"amount":302.7,"local_amount":2063.85,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2076.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076904}],"funded_date":"2015-06-22T01:07:40Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":896439,"name":"Angela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Angela es una mujer de 46 a\u00f1os de edad, casada, tiene 2 hijos varones de 18 y 25 a\u00f1os y una hija mujer de 22 a\u00f1os, y su negocio es la conexi\u00f3n de gas domiciliario.\nElla es buena madre, emprendedora, dedicada, independiente, responsable y muy trabajadora.

Her business is connecting gas in homes. She is a good mother, enterprising, dedicated, independent, responsible and hard-working. <br \/><br \/>Her business takes place in the Pampahasi area. It is located to the north of the city at the foot of the mountains where the streets are steep and hard to climb. It has a cold and dry climate with daily temperatures that vary between 0 and 12 degrees Celsius. Angela is wheat colored, has dark colored eyes and uses glasses. She has dark brown hair down to her shoulders, is short in stature and robust in build. Her native language is Aymara which she speaks in her family and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and for her business. <br \/><br \/>She lives her life with her husband who works in the same business and her 3 children who are independent. They live in a room that is property of the family built of brick and cement with a metal roof and wood floor that has running water, electricity, gas and sewage. Her business is connecting gas to homes. Her clients contact her to take charge of budgeting the work (materials, labor, etc.) and fulfill all the required processes (technical and administrative) through to the actual gas connection, without the client having to go to the company's offices. \"I started my business because of the nationalization of hydrocarbons. This created the demand and I actually run a family business\", she comments. The advantage of the business is that it is constant. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy working material like pipes, metal saws, glue and others.

Rita lives there with her husband and her only cute son. She sells mobile airtime credits to her community. Rita joined Ruma almost a year ago and was introduced to Ruma by a Ruma sales executive who came to her house.

Rita is a kind and cheerful person. Her community sees her as a trusted and informative mobile airtime provider. \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Rita needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva lenders.

Due to the low financial situation of Palestinians in Lebanon, especially those who live in camps, she started eighteen years ago helping her husband in agriculture, where she rents croplands, plants them (Olives, figs, grapes, etc..), and then sell the crops.

years old). \r\nSamvel works at local village municipality as an assistant. Because the work in the office is not too much, most of the day Samvel works with his farm. He keeps a livestock of two cows and three calves. Samvel also gets income from cultivating wheat, potato and cabbage in the family yard. He has been involved in farming business for over 20 years and it has become a part of his life. \r\n\r\nTo enlarge the current farm and get more income for his family, Samvel asks lenders to help him with this loan. He plans to purchase  three calves to enlarge the livestock herd and also seeds and forage for land cultivation. \r\n\r\nThis is Samvel's  second loan. Unfortunately the first loan, which she got from local financial institutions, was very difficult to return back, and he faced some difficulties.

Ernesto, 65, has to wake up very early in the morning and sleep late at night in order to meet the demands of customers who sometimes buy as early as 4:30am or as late as 10:30pm. It\u2019s a good thing that his wife, Visminda, lovingly assists him throughout the day. Their usual everyday necessities are being supported by the income from their variety store. \r\n\r\nThey have been operating this business for thirty five years and it helped a lot in their children\u2019s education. However, their income is not enough to set aside some savings as they aged. Now that Ernesto and his wife are already in their old age, they still want to improve their business. Ernesto is longing to have additional capital of PhP 12,000 that he will use to buy more dry goods and grocery items for sale in his variety store. He\u2019s aiming that he can save some amount from additional income that will be derived from these goods. He can use the savings as emergency fund in case he or his wife will get sick.

It\u2019s hard to imagine the sacrifices of Marilou, 50 years old, as she tries to provide for her four children who are all studying in college. She praises God that she\u2019s blessed with a responsible husband, Eladio, a driver, who is her companion in all triumphs and trials. They both work consistently to achieve their dream of having professional children. They believe that education is the most valuable inheritance that they can give their children.   \r\n\r\nMarilou runs a variety store in Santa Barbara, Iloilo. The store sells various commodities like canned goods, repacked cooking oil, sachets of shampoo and conditioner, packs of condiments and spices, softdrinks, and many others. The profit from her business covers their family expenses, but she hopes to gain more profit so she can better provide for her children\u2019s educational needs. To improve her business, she desires to ask for PhP 10,000 loan which she will use to buy more stocks of items to sell. In the long run, she hopes to expand her store into a big grocery. You\u2019ll be a great blessing in advance.

Translated in English, it goes like this \u201cI dream that families are not separated by needs just to live\u201d. Wella, 30, from Santa Barbara, Iloilo, Philippines, can sentimentally identify with this song because her husband Romel, also 30, had to leave her and their little child to seek for a more decent wage abroad. It\u2019s difficult for a starting family like hers to be separated from each other. This is why Wella works hard to expand her business of food vending and catering. She hopes that her income would be enough to support all their needs, so that her husband need not work abroad anymore. \r\n\r\nInstead of feeling lonesome due to the absence of her husband, Wella focuses her attention to her business. She harnessed her cooking talent by preparing delicious cuisine, expanded her network and offered catering services to them. But catering service is occasional and income is unstable. It\u2019s best for her to have as many clients as possible even if there would be two or more occasions or catering requests at the same time. It would bring her more profit. Her only problem is the limited utensils, equipments, tables and chairs to be used for simultaneous occasions. She humbly requests for a PhP 38,000 loan to buy all these things. She may also need to hire occasional waiters and helpers. Hope you could be God\u2019s instrument to grant her request and contribute few steps to make her family whole someday. \r\n\r\nWella draws inspiration from her co-fellowship* members who meet every week to share stories of their life and business and to draw strength the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Unfortunately the first loan, which she got from local financial institutions, was very difficult to repay, and Mayram faced some difficulties.

Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

The seven women who make up the Friendship Bridge trust bank \u201cLas Esteli San Lucas\u201d live and work here. They have great hopes for expanding their small businesses, educating their children and raising their standard of living.\r\n\r\nOne of the youngest members of the trust bank is 23-year-old Heidy, who is single and the president of the group.  For the past two years, Heidy has been selling cosmetics.  Little by little her business has been growing enough so that she is able to continue her study of nursing at the university as well as to help with her family\u2019s income.  Heidy is requesting a loan in order to buy more cosmetics, including creams, shampoos, cases of makeup, deodorants, and lotions.  All of these cosmetic items are in great demand right now!\r\n\r\nHeidy and the women of \u201cLas Esteli San Lucas\u201d are grateful for the loans but are also very appreciative to be able to participate in the non-formal education portion of their monthly meetings. They learn about many important and useful subjects like health and hygiene, nutrition and the use of medicinal plants as well as teenage pregnancy and women\u2019s rights.

es una joven mujer de 19 a\u00f1os de edad, soltera, sin hijos, y su negocio es la venta de alimentos y productos de primera necesidad en su tienda de barrio. Ella es emprendedora, amable, de buena actitud, comprometida con su trabajo, generosa, alegre, responsable y muy trabajadora. Su negocio lo realiza en la localidad \u2018Sacaba\u2019 ubicado a 25 kil\u00f3metros al sur este de la ciudad donde los pobladores se dedican mayormente a actividades agropecuarias, los j\u00f3venes y ni\u00f1os adoptan r\u00e1pidamente un trabajo para apoyar a sus familias, dejando de lado los estudios. Los trabajos normalmente est\u00e1n relacionados a cuidado de ganado y ni\u00f1eras o ayudante de alba\u00f1iles en la ciudad. Dichas actividades son riesgosas y llevan a los ni\u00f1os, ni\u00f1as y adolescentes a posibles situaciones de explotaci\u00f3n laboral. \nMelissa es de tez morena, ojos pardos, cabello largo negro lo usa amarrado, baja estatura, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica mediana, su lengua materna es el Quechua que se habla en el lugar y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y por el negocio que realiza. Viven en una casa propiedad de la familia construida de ladrillo y cemento con techo de calamina y piso de cemento que cuenta con energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y agua de pozo extra\u00edda mediante bomba el\u00e9ctrica. Su negocio es la venta de alimentos y art\u00edculos de primera necesidad como; pan, az\u00facar fideo, arroz, refrescos, galletas, productos de limpieza, etc., en su tienda de barrio que debido a la falta de comercio en la zona no tiene competencia. Actividad que realiza de forma independiente todos los d\u00edas de la semana en horario del d\u00eda, \u201cmi madre me regal\u00f3 el negocio para que tenga una actividad comercial, mi meta es consolidar mi negocio\u2026\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que no cuenta con competencia en el lugar, la desventaja es la distancia de sus proveedores y de su tienda. Su sue\u00f1o es abrir una empresa distribuidora para realizar ventas por mayor, ella desea ampliar su negocio realizando la compra por mayor de abarrotes y material escolar para la venta en su tienda, ya que existe una escuela cercana y existe demanda de esos productos. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 5 a\u00f1os que se dedica a esta actividad. \nEs por esos motivos que Melissa solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de abarrotes y material escolar para surtir su tienda y con los beneficios convertirse en vendedora mayorista.\n","en":" Melissa is a young woman who is 19 years of age.  She is single and has no children.  She has a business selling food and consumer staples in her neighborhood store.  She is enterprising and kind, and she has a good attitude and is committed to her work.  She is also generous, cheerful, responsible, and very hardworking.  Her business is located in the town of Sacaba, located 25 kilometers to the south of the city.  Here, the residents work mainly in agriculture. The youths and children leave their studies to work very quickly in order to help support their families.  Generally their work is related to the care of livestock and babysitting, or helping out with construction in the city.  These activities are risky, and they put the boys, girls, and adolescents into possible situations of worker exploitation.\r\n\r\nMelissa has a dark complexion, dark eyes, long black hair tied back, a short stature, and a medium physique.  Her native language is Quechua, which she speaks in the place, and she also speaks Spanish in the general culture and in her business.  They live in a home that is her family's property.  It is built with brick and cement and has a tin roof and cement floors.  The house has electricity and well water extracted with an electric pump.  \r\n\r\nMelissa has a business selling food and consumer staples such as bread, sugar, noodles, rice, soft drinks, cookies, cleaning products, etc.  Due to the lack of commerce in the area, her neighborhood store has no competition.  She works independently every day of the week on a daily schedule.  \"My mother gave me the business so that I could have a commercial activity. My goal is to consolidate my business,\" she comments. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of Melissa's business is the lack of competition in the area.  The disadvantage is that her store is very far from her suppliers.  Her goal is to open a distributorship where she could make her sales at wholesale.  She wants to expand her business by purchasing groceries at wholesale and by purchasing school supplies to sell in her store, because there is a school nearby and so there is demand for these products. This is the first loan she has taken with the institution in the 5 years that she has been developing her business. \r\n\r\nThis is why Melissa is requesting a loan to purchase groceries and school supplies to stock her store, so that with the profits she can convert her business into a wholesale distributorship.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1896542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries and school supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-17T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-17T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-09T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-08T04:00:00Z","amount":391.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T04:00:00Z","amount":407.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":386.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T04:00:00Z","amount":454.02},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T04:00:00Z","amount":460.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T04:00:00Z","amount":458.04},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T04:00:00Z","amount":510.42},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T04:00:00Z","amount":511.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T04:00:00Z","amount":534.22},{"due_date":"2016-03-08T04:00:00Z","amount":574.37},{"due_date":"2016-04-08T04:00:00Z","amount":582.92},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T04:00:00Z","amount":608.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T04:00:00Z","amount":641.07},{"due_date":"2016-07-08T04:00:00Z","amount":668.32},{"due_date":"2016-08-08T04:00:00Z","amount":692.74},{"due_date":"2016-09-08T04:00:00Z","amount":723.17},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T04:00:00Z","amount":752.95},{"due_date":"2016-11-08T04:00:00Z","amount":641.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.13},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.82},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.42},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.21},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.46},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.28},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.52},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.24},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.95},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.91},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.45},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.86},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.18},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":117.41,"local_amount":809.69,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":811.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554834},{"amount":54.41,"local_amount":375.31,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":376.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468920},{"amount":1278.18,"local_amount":8815,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":8831.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296754}],"funded_date":"2015-07-17T21:14:55Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":897049,"name":"Fernando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fernando, tiene la edad  de 69 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casado, vive con su esposa y su hija,  los cuales son su mayor prioridad.

Claudia's business is selling fried chicken. \nShe is a good mother, enterprising, independent, generous, patient, responsible and hard-working. <br \/><br \/>She works itinerantly in the Plan 3000 area which is known for the origin of it's inhabitants, Ayoreas tribes, native to the area and miners relocated to the area from the west. They settled in the area and started manufacturing and commerce. It is a hot, very humid, sub-tropical climate with a daily temperature that varies between 21 to 35 degrees Celsius. <br \/><br \/>Claudia is dark-skinned, dark eyes, and has long dark hair that she ties back at her neck, is short in stature and of medium build. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed  which she speaks with her family and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and for her business. (She is the first one who is stand up to the right in the photo wearing a brown and white blouse). <br \/><br \/>She shares her life with her partner, who works, and her children, who study at school. Her children are independent and have their own families. She lives in her own house made of cement and bricks with a metal roof and brick floor which has running water, electricity and sewage.  <br \/><br \/>Due to her need to continue with her business she decided to form a communal bank with people with businesses like; second-hand clothing sales, selling fruit, selling tomatoes, knitting, selling fish, a cleaning service, selling empanadas, selling cosmetics and selling seasonal clothing to request a loan and improve their businesses. <br \/><br \/>Her business is selling fried chicken, a business she does at a sales stand in the street in different locations. Her food is composed of pieces of meat from young chickens, sometimes in flour or in batter and fries. What distinguishes her chicken from others is that she normally cuts them at the joints leaving the bones and skin intact. The well-seasoned, crusty skin, low in fat is the distinction of her chicken. \"I am going to open a fixed stand and to do this I need a roof to protect my clients from the sun and rain\", she commented. <br \/><br \/>The advantage of her business is that it is a fast food that people consume daily, her disadvantage is the lack of capital to build her roof. Her dream is to open a fried chicken snack shop. This is her first loan with the institution in the year and a half she has been in this business.
