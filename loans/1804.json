Now she is a homemaker and raising her children (a daughter and a son). Her children read in the local village school.<br \/><br \/>Shyamali's husband has been engaged with farming activities. He cultivates different crops on their own plot of land. Though Shyamali is a housewife, she helps her husband in the farming work. Together, the couple has been working hard, since this is their sole source of income. They have been selling the produce in the local town market. However, a major part of the harvest is sold to the wholesale dealers in the market. <br \/><br \/>Now they want to expand their business by cultivating paddies, as paddy is a staple food of the region and the demand for it has always been good. Shyamali wants a good and abundant harvest so that the rest of the year they don't have to face any financial problems. For that, they need good-quality seeds and other farm supplies. To achieve the same, the couple needs some capital.<br \/><br \/>So, Shyamali has taken a loan from Kiva's partner BJS to purchase good-quality paddy seeds, fertilizers, and other agricultural inputs to grow paddies.

Unfortunately, she lost her husband a few years ago, and she had to take all the responsibilities of the family. \r\n\r\nDipa, being a housewife, now runs her own animal husbandry. She owns milking cows, and she sells milk to her local villagers and neighbors. She earns barely enough to cover all the household expenses. To cope with the growing demand of her customers and rising prices of daily essential commodities, she wants to expand her business. So Dipa applied for a loan from BJS (a Kiva partner) to purchase a dairy cow. \r\n\r\nWith this, she hopes she can sell more milk as per her customers\u2019 demand so that she can increase her income and thereby increase her savings also, which is very much essential for future emergencies.

Day after day he worked in his farther's workshop, learning the skills of this art. His knowledge was based in the techniques that his father taught him, which enabled him to create new designs and structures and also to make repairs and create all types of wood furniture. <br \/><br \/>Despite his work in a furniture factory, he didn't make enough money to offer his family a decent quality of life, and so he decided to start his own business. His main challenge was starting up without all of the essential tools of the trade, but he has been able to acquire them little by little. Currently, he is asking for his first loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, which will be used to buy the basic materials needed for his business. <br \/><br \/>David is a dedicated man, capable of overcoming obstacles, and his goal is to educate himself and get professionally certified. At the family level, his goal is to be able to offer his daughter a high-quality education so that she can go to college."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":107.42,"image":{"id":1897520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to buy materials for his carpentry business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-06-18T04:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-18T04:20:05Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.61,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David Elias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":46462},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":71856},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":74012},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":76232},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":78519},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":80874},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83301},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":85800},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":88374},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":91025},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":93756},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":129789}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.41},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.32},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.32},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.35},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.41},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.53,"local_amount":46462,"processed_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":47521.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.06,"payment_id":696560924},{"amount":26.72,"local_amount":71856,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":73494.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.02,"payment_id":711475649},{"amount":28.67,"local_amount":74012,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":75699.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.93,"payment_id":730994512},{"amount":27.89,"local_amount":76232,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:23:19Z","rounded_local_amount":77970.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.6,"payment_id":752082475}],"funded_date":"2015-06-18T12:32:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":901701,"name":"Divina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Divina is a married woman with three children.

hardworking, polite and honest. Yucabeth lives in Nyamira, a remote area in Kenya. Nyamira is at the center of a primary banana and maize growing region. However, most farmers, like Yucabeth, prefer to keep income-generating animals on their farmland, too. \r\n\r\nYucabeth started farming 35 years ago. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs and maize. She uses the income from these activities to take care of her family. \r\n\r\nYucabeth is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. With more poultry on her farm, she will produce more eggs for food, hatching and selling.

for almost 10 years now. She is 37 years of age and blessed with four children. Her husband, Rolando, helps her in their business and they work hand-in-hand to provide for their needs.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Lorena wants to make her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like to avail a loan amounting to 35,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional grocery items that are needed. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nLorena aspires to save enough money so she can afford to send her children to college and make them finish their schooling. She also wants to expand her business. She prays for more strength for her family always. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":710.41,"image":{"id":1905145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy additional grocery items that are needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-18T12:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-18T12:50:05Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":290.64,"local_amount":13124.97,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":13176.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523352},{"amount":129.16,"local_amount":5833.32,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5856.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433781},{"amount":161.45,"local_amount":7291.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":7320.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954700},{"amount":129.16,"local_amount":5833.32,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5856.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044621}],"funded_date":"2015-07-05T10:28:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":901824,"name":"Agustina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agustina owns and operates a food stall.

But she's really hopeful that she'll be successful with this. \r\n\r\nToday, she asks for your helping hands for the continuation of her inventory.

If she gains such, it would be an advantage, since people get more attracted when there are more displayed than the usual. \r\n\r\nShe really hopes that you can help her with this. She is doing this for her children's education, wishing they would be able to complete their studies- and her remaining hope relies in you. \r\n\r\nAs of today, she's active in attending a weekly fellowship that enables her to draw strength and inspiration to push towards the goal through the word of God that she studies with her colleagues. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Emmy, from Bomet, a remote town in Kenya, is an active and progressive farmer in her locality. She has a handsome husband and together they live on a small piece of land. Traditionally, her primary source of income has been eggs, crops, a personal business, and she has been practicing farming for the past 22 years. Having done farming for such a long time she has gained so much experience that she is always ranked the best farmer in her village. Demand for dairy milk has been high and Emmy wants to take advantage of the market. \r\n\r\nTherefore, she is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is another profitable agricultural venture in Kenya and Emmy has already identified the breed of dairy cow that she wants. Emmy always says that, \u201cTo become a successful dairy farmer, one does not need to be a livestock expert. All one needs is passion, information, and keenness to learn from the successful farmers.\u201d  Marketing of the dairy milk and dairy products will not be a challenge, because she will sell the milk directly to the market and also to big dairy processing firms. Through the loan, Emmy will not only benefit from milk, but will also benefit from manure (cow dung) that will be used in improving the fertility of her farm, thus saving money that would have been spent buying fertilizer. \r\n\r\nEmmy has been facing challenges in accessing finances, but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, are there to make her dream come true. Emmy chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low and is on a reducing basis. Emmy underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and during the training season she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. Through accumulated profits Emmy plans to permanently improve her living conditions, and to secure the future of her school-aged children by paying tuition fees for them. She plans that through increased income, she will be able to buy more dairy cows and build a bio-gas digester, and hence save costs incurred in buying fuel."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":454.59,"image":{"id":1885119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a quality breed of cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bomet","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-06-18T13:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-18T13:20:05Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6451.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6639.76},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6833.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":7033.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":7239.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":7450.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":7668.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":7892.49},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":8123.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":8360.55},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":8604.89},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":8856.36},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":9115.19},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":9381.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":9655.76},{"due_date":"2016-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":9937.95},{"due_date":"2016-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10228.38},{"due_date":"2016-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10527.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.01},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.23},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.87},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.29},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.79},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.35},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.71},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.51},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.38},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.35},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.4},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":99.2,"local_amount":9447.25,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":9521.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681378738},{"amount":115.81,"local_amount":11029.27,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:21Z","rounded_local_amount":11116.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588459},{"amount":239.58,"local_amount":22817.52,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":22997.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023565}],"funded_date":"2015-06-20T07:44:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":901791,"name":"Rifat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rifat is the age of 49, living with her husband in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. \r\nHer husband owns an electrician shop in which he sells electrical goods and provides services for repairing electrical components, such as ceiling fans, washing machines and troubleshoots the underground electrical supply.

Meet Rose, one of the most hardworking and dedicated women on planet earth. She is based in Rareti, a remote village in the Nyamira area of Kenya. She is happily married. She blessed with two lovely children. For the past 10 years she has been engaging in mixed farming and through selling milk and a variety of food crops she has earned a decent income. Like many farmers in her village, she also plants trees on her farm to complement the region's natural forests. Although Rose makes profits selling her farm produce at the market, the biggest challenge she faces is lack of water to irrigate her farm and water for home consumption. Rose comes from an area where there is no water connection and she is always forced to walk for a long distance for this \u201cprecious commodity\u201d. \r\n\r\nBeing 29 years of age, she faces challenges carrying water on her back. Rose is seeking a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the farmers in Kenya depend on rain fed agriculture but Rose wants to change that notion and start irrigation farming. Through the loan she intends to harvest rain water which always goes to waste and store it in the tanks. She intends to buy pipes that will be used to pump water from the river directly to her farm. With your loan Rose will be saved the trouble of walking a long distance in search of water and she will have enough water for home consumption. Irrigating her farm will boast productivity since water is an important requirement in the germination of crops.\r\n\r\nRose is very excited about this project and hopes her dream will be achieved through the loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders. Increased productivity means increased income and this will translate to improved living standards. She will use the additional income to improve and secure the future of her children.

The Nyamira area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. That is why Charles is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh.

She is humble and simple. She is a passionate, small-scale dairy farmer based in Lessos village. She stays with her husband, with whom she is blessed with six children. \r\n\r\nSubsistence farming is very common in Lessos. Peres is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. You might be wondering, \"Why a dairy cow?\" Five years ago, Juhudi Kilimo ventured into the market with the sole aim of changing farmers' perspective towards farming. Through giving out loans for acquiring income-generating assets, farmers carry out farming with the aim of making big returns in order to repay the loan and make a profit. \r\n\r\nAfter servicing the first loan, they get the logic and seek another loan, usually a higher amount, to do bigger projects and make more money for themselves. In this model, farmers, like Peres, start by planning and choosing a farming enterprise that will enable them to earn enough profit to repay the loan and use the extra amount. The farmer must also keep the market in mind when making these decisions. \r\n\r\nPeres identified dairy farming. In order to engage in that, she needs your loan, which she is going to invest so that she can make more money. She is going for a good quality animal. Her money from this investment will enable her to earn more income and pull her family out of poverty."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":134.6,"image":{"id":1895141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-06-18T14:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-18T14:30:04Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peres","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":41400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2929.99},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3015.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3103.76},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3194.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3287.82},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3383.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3482.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3584.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3689.35},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3797.17},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3908.17},{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4022.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.08},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.74},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.98},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":69.89,"local_amount":6807.94,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6848.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588523},{"amount":64.71,"local_amount":6303.15,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:33Z","rounded_local_amount":6340.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023634}],"funded_date":"2015-06-24T06:25:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":902190,"name":"Marivic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marivic is a woman with two children.

Monica practices mixed crop and dairy farming. Through these two farming activities, she always puts food on the table for her family. Although Monica has been making profits by selling vegetables and milk to the nearby markets and neighbors, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious mother. She has been facing a challenge of transporting her produce to the market and the timely delivery of products. Monica sells perishable products, and she does not have proper storage facilities. Therefore, she needs to make sure that the products reach the market on time. Because of poor feeder roads and the transport network in her area, this is a challenge she has faced. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. The motorbike will help her transport her products to the market. As a result of this loan, Monica will be able to timely deliver her products. She will earn more profit by selling fresher products at a higher price. Monica's dream is to secure the future of her children and to improve her living conditions. Through improved profits, Monica is sure that her dream will be achieved. She will also have a positive impact in her society through creating employment because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike.

The land she is fully planned for and thus cannot be used to grow any more crops. With your loan, however, Sally can rent 2 more acres that she can use to plant more food crops this season. \r\nHer diligence is evident in the fact that she ploughs her entire plot of land using a hoe, by herself. She strongly feels that she can do more once she can secure more land. Income she makes from your loan investment will be used to service the loan, grow the business and to meet her family's basic needs.

He is a super incredible farmer! He certainly ranks among the top successful smallholder farmers on Juhudi Kilimo's client list. Born in 1986 into a humble family, Jared\u2019s upbringing was difficult. He attended school and cleared secondary, after which he got into mixed farming 5 years ago. He also married a beautiful and loving wife. Together, they are blessed with 2 children. \r\n\r\nJared practices farming on a 3-acre farm that is owned by the family in the village of Makairo. On the farm, he grows tea, vegetables, beans and maize. He also keeps more than two highly productive dairy cows for milk production. The 29-year-old farmer sells his produce in bulk to the nearby market. His key clients are his neighbours and local people. He is a member of Omwaro Group, a group formed to help members, who are smallholder farmers, to save and use the savings to access loans from financial institutions. \r\n\r\nJared is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to build a greenhouse. He needs greenhouse technology to continuously improve the productivity, profitability and sustainability of his major farming systems. A greenhouse will provide a favorable environment for his plants. It will also protect the plants from adverse climatic conditions such as wind, cold, precipitation, excessive radiation, extreme temperature, insects and diseases. With your lending, Jared will have a year-round production of crops and off-season production of vegetable and fruits. He will also save on the use of natural resources such as water. Water requirement of crops is very limited and easy to control with this technology. \r\n\r\nJared has a great credit history. In 2013, he took a KES 90,000 loan and successfully serviced it. This will be his second loan with Juhudi Kilimo. After successfully clearing the previous loans, he stated that this loan will change his life. Profits from this investment will be be plowed back into the business to fuel further growth. There still remains so much space on his land for future growth. If there ever was an opportunity to invest a $25 loan in someone's future, it is here! You won't regret it!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":280.72,"image":{"id":1895494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To build a green house for increased diversity on his farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-06-18T14:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-18T14:50:04Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jared","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6369.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6555.7},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6747.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6944.49},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":7147.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":7356.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":7571.32},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":7792.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":8020.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8254.72},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8495.96},{"due_date":"2016-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8744.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.35},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.37},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.61},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.82},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.09},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.43},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.84},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.32},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150.8,"local_amount":14672.1,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":14717.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588530},{"amount":129.92,"local_amount":12641.19,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":12680.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023640}],"funded_date":"2015-07-06T19:02:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":901319,"name":"Leuta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leuta is 63 years old and married with eight children.\r\n \r\nShe has a small plantation where she grows taro and bananas that she can sell in her community or at the market.

That is why she is seeking a loan to buy farm implements such as fertilizers and seeds that will assist her to produce more. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Lenah will be able to completely turn around her life because the production level on her farm will increase, and this means more income. Through the loan, she will be able to assure her family of improved living standards, and she is confident that the new profits will allow her to comfortably repay the loan.

Born in 1986 in the Nandi region of Kenya, Magdalene has grown up to be a very hardworking and enterprising woman. Her upbringing was not easy but at least she managed to finish her secondary education. She is currently running a 3 acre mixed farm in Kilibwoni village with the unwavering contribution of her dear handsome husband. She keeps dairy cattle that give her milk to sell. \r\n\r\nMagdalene is seeking a loan to purchase land. 12 years ago she ventured into farming, she has been relying on her husband's farm to run the agribusiness, and still will. However, the business has grown and all the space is totally utilized. With the loan investment, she will acquire additional land to facilitate the growth of her business.

Even though quality seeds cost more, and the sellers target big farmers, Juliana is stretching herself by paying more for them because she sees the value in planting quality seeds that have gone through vigorous testing. The impact of this loan will be reflected in the ability of the seeds to produce normal seedlings under adverse growing conditions. These seeds are likely to survive Kapsowar's harsh weather that has seen acres of crops fail in the past. \r\n\r\nHaving a successful crop farm is a step forward for Juliana's family towards food and financial security.
