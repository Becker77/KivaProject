Meet Fred, a family man and smallholder farmer from Chepchoina village in Kenya. He is married to a lovely wife known as Ann and together, they have 5 children, the youngest being only a year old. \r\nFred started farming 4 years ago to supplement his monthly salary. He aspires to grow his agri-business, become self-employed and to employ others.

They are from Sauce which is located in the northern part of the region. They are known as responsible, hard workers with a desire for personal improvement. \r\n\r\nSauce is known as a milk, curd, and cheese-producing area and therefore most people engage in selling milk and curds. They do so starting at a very young age to help with household expenses. Unfortunately, they were unable to go to school because they did not have the money. Today they struggle to provide their children with the opportunity to have the education that they did not have, and to realize every parent's dream of seeing their children become professionals. \r\n\r\nThanks to her desire to get ahead, Erlinda is the group's coordinator. Her occupation is selling milk and curd from her house and by special order in the village grocery stores. She devotes about eight hours every day to her business, offering her products to meet the demand of her clients and providing good customer service.  In the not-too-distant-future she hopes to increase her income. Her goal is to invest working capital in the purchase of milk and curd for resale. \r\n\r\nThe Santa Elena solidarity group thanks Kiva investors for their help so they can have their own businesses and support their households financially. \"Thank you investors.\""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":537.5,"image":{"id":1898161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese Making","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy and sell milk, curd, and cheese.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2015-06-18T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-18T21:40:01Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rafael Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erling Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esmelda Erlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2900},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2900},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2900},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2900},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2900},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2900},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2900},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2900},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2900},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":215.04,"local_amount":5801,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5840.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696600430},{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":2900.08,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2919.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711519859},{"amount":109.04,"local_amount":2941.66,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-24T12:11:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2961.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":733233719},{"amount":105.92,"local_amount":2857.26,"processed_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2876.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752310064}],"funded_date":"2015-07-13T20:13:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":902326,"name":"Saum","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saum is a married woman with 4 children.

Perishable products such as milk, vegetable and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price and through this loan Florence is going to achieve her dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Florence feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Florence will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market. Also she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market, hence increased income level. Florence is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work.

She is a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. Through her dairy cows, she is able to get between 10-15 litres of milk a day, and this helps her support her family. \r\n\r\nJemima also practices crop farming. She has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements. . This is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm inputs. Through this loan, she will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and increased profit levels. Jemima is very visionary. \r\n\r\nHer goal for the season is to boost her crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year.

While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. \r\n\r\nIt is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to give Betsy access to a loan that will aid her in growing her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increasing employment opportunities and bringing about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Betsy\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business.

She carries out her business in the \u2018San Nicolas\u2019 area, which is in an avenue that joins the road and passes through different areas of this district.

Her mother tongue is Aymara, which she speaks with her family, and speaks Spanish for general knowledge and because of the business she carries out. She lives with her children who are studying in a school. They live in their own house built of brick and cement. The ceiling is made of corrugated metal sheet and the floor of wood. The house has drinking water, electric power, household natural gas and sanitation.\r\n\r\nHer business is to make vicu\u00f1a blankets. Her job is to walk long distances in the high plateau looking for vicu\u00f1a wool. Afterwards she prepares the wool to tack it. Once she has enough wool she weaves it in a loom. Her work is purely handcrafted and every blanket takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks to be finished. \"I started in the business weaving for other people, then got to know the market and became independent for the well-being of my children\" she says.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she has a list of regular clients and the disadvantage is the lack of machinery to tack the wool. Her dream is to open a shop of crafted fabrics. She wishes to invest in her business through the purchase of wool in bulk to have enough material to work during the winter season. This is the first group of loans with the institution in 7 years that has been doing this activity independently.\r\nFor this reasons Sehila is requesting a loan to buy vicu\u00f1a wool in bulk to work in winter and buy a spinning machine for wool with the profits.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":256.39,"image":{"id":1898118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy vicu\u00f1a wool to weave in winter and buy a spinning machine for wool with the profits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-18T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-18T22:20:03Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sehila Enriqueta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-11T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T04:00:00Z","amount":299.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T04:00:00Z","amount":347.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T04:00:00Z","amount":344.14},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T04:00:00Z","amount":382.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T04:00:00Z","amount":393.54},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T04:00:00Z","amount":401.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T04:00:00Z","amount":431.31},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T04:00:00Z","amount":442.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T04:00:00Z","amount":461.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T04:00:00Z","amount":486.17},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T04:00:00Z","amount":503.28},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T04:00:00Z","amount":506.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.9},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.06},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.12},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.49},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.98},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.51,"local_amount":300.08,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":300.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344621},{"amount":51.05,"local_amount":352.1,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":352.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554836},{"amount":49.24,"local_amount":339.5,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":339.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468922},{"amount":55.68,"local_amount":384.02,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":384.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296756},{"amount":56.91,"local_amount":392.45,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:52Z","rounded_local_amount":392.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076915}],"funded_date":"2015-06-19T00:31:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maya Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez","image":null}},{"id":902345,"name":"Almabilla","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Almabilla is a 49-year-old mother of two boys age eight and twelve from Badian, Cebu.

Mahina lives with her husband and his family. She has always wanted to have a large and harmonious family, and hopes to become a mother soon.\r\n\r\nFor about 5 years, Mahina has sold men's clothing at the bazaar. Her mother-in-law helps her with her work, but Mahina usually works at the clothing stall alone. In order to earn money and care for themselves and their parents, Mahina and her husband must go to work no matter the weather.

Jocelyn was recently granted a loan that helped her a lot to establish her sari-sari (variety store) business. Through your small act of help, she was able to supply her small store with more grocery stocks which resulted in a higher income and salary. \r\n\r\nJocelyn would like to ask your sympathy as she pushes her goal further to improve what she has started. She is requesting a 48,000 PHP loan to buy additional stocks of grocery items to sell along with other stuffs.  Jocelyn\u2019s loan will surely bring joy and gladness to her since she sees this opportunity as a milestone to success.

She is married to a Baptist Pastor and they have children. They live in Oton, Iloilo where Judy raises hogs for additional income.

With profits from her business, she has been able to buy a new sewing machine to replace the old one. The other group member, Sinikiwe, runs a poultry business from her home. She usually keeps batches of 150 birds at a time. She has been able to send her 4 children to school with the income from poultry rearing.\nDeborah group is currently on their fifth loan cycle and so far, they have a good repayment history. The Deborah group needs a $1200 loan and from her portion of the loan, Barbra plans to buy another sewing machine so that she increases her production levels. This cotton industry has just come to life in Zimbabwe and rural farmers will be selling their produce at several market places set up by cotton buyers. Not only will she supply her South Africa market as usual, she will be able to make use of the opportunity that has arisen locally.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1903608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy a new sewing machine for her tailoring business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-06-18T23:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-18T23:10:08Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Barbra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sinikiwe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:15:21Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696747246},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711678926},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:29:51Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731183054},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752271199}],"funded_date":"2015-06-19T21:39:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":902393,"name":"Lemuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Lemuel, 29 years old and his partner, Flora May, is 22 years old. They have two small children. They are starting a family and undergoing some adjustments at this stage.\r\n\r\nLemuel runs a \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store in Oton, Iloilo and he continues to work hard in order to maintain and improve it. He is targeting to increase his income and enhance his savings for his family. However, the profit derived from his store varies from time to time as it is usually affected by the competition within the area. Its stability is also shaken by some of his neighbors who have the habit of paying later for those items they get. Sometimes it takes few days or weeks before they pay. He is a kind-hearted person who cannot refuse his neighbors because he understands that there are times when it\u2019s really hard to earn money. But since he also needs to save for his small children, he has to make his business more stable. He can do it by acquiring additional capital of PhP 50,000 to buy more stocks of dry goods and grocery items for his store. With this additional capital, he would be able to boost his income and savings. He\u2019s praying that you have the kind heart to extend support to him and his starting family. It will surely go a long way. He plans to expand his business and open new enterprises someday with the help of his partner.\r\n\r\nLemuel prays for good health and good future for the whole family especially for his children. He shares his aspirations and life reflections with his co-fellowship* members at CCT who regularly meet every week to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1906201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more stocks of dry goods and grocery items for his variety store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Oton, Iloilo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-18T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-18T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lemuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":9999.99,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":10152.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314640},{"amount":375,"local_amount":16666.65,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":16921.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523363},{"amount":300,"local_amount":13333.32,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:55Z","rounded_local_amount":13537.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433792},{"amount":225,"local_amount":10000.04,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":10153.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954711}],"funded_date":"2015-06-19T10:38:18Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":897677,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase seeds and manure for reseeding.

She can still manage to run a variety store and a small canteen or food stall. For almost eighteen years, her business has been the source of their family income. It provided for their daily expenses and children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nSmall canteen is commonly known in the Philippines as \u201ccarenderia\u201d. Most of Filipino families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal.  But if there is only one or two family members present for dinner, they would prefer to buy cooked viand or food. This is a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. This is the reason why Elisa\u2019s carenderia business is considered valuable. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community, students and working people. \r\n\r\nBut the presence of other carenderia threatens her business. She needs to improve her place by placing some appliances like electric fans or a television for the benefit of customers. This method will make her carenderia more desirable. She is praying for a PhP 60,000 loan to buy these appliances. Part of the loan will be allotted for additional quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. Even at her age, she needs to compete and remain strong in her business, because as a self-employed widow, she has no medical benefits or pension when she retires. She only relies from her savings and any help from her children who are raising their own families too.\r\n\r\nShe meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from her studies of the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her store is stocked with dry goods and packaged commodities, with almost all of her products being essential household items and food. She buys these goods at wholesale prices and then sells them retail to her neighbors and the local community. \r\n\r\nBecause sari-sari stores are very common in the Philippines, competition is stiff. Customers tend to visit the stores with wide selections. This is Susan\u2019s fundamental problem. As you can see in the photo, her store offers a limited selection of goods. Therefore, she needs to display a lot more items to attract customers to her store. \r\n\r\nA PHP 13,000 loan would be of great help to her. She will use the funds to buy goods and grocery items for her store. Your kind heart and generous assistance will solve her problem and may contribute to help Susan attain her dream of having a better life.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community clients such as Susan are organized into fellowship groups of fifteen to thirty members who meet on a weekly basis.

This season is difficult for fishermen and fish vendors. Practically, it\u2019s dangerous for fishermen to go fishing. The scarcity of fish makes its price higher, and the fish vendors find it hard to afford. \r\n\r\nEstilita, 67, is married to Dionisio, also 67 years old and a fisherman. They have children who are still studying in college and high school. They live in Barotac Viejo, Iloilo. Estilita is a fish vendor who usually sells fish caught by her husband. But due to old age, her husband can hardly go out to the sea to catch fish. In times like this, Estilita has no choice but to buy fish from other fishermen. She needs to prepare for this season of rain, hence she seeks for additional capital of PhP 12,000. Part of it will be used to buy fishing nets for his husband and paint for their fishing boat, while the rest will be used to buy volume quantity of fish. This additional capital will keep her business running even during rainy season because it will strengthen her buying power even if the price of fish is high. You can be the answer to her prayers through your generous support. Thank you so much in advance.\r\n\r\nEstilita dreams that someday, she will acquire several fishing boats for rent. The rental fees from these boats will sustain their needs when she can no longer sell fish and her husband is no longer capable of fishing.  She remains a zealous member of CCT where she gains inspiration from her co-fellowship* members who regularly meet once a week to study the Word of God and share stories of their life and businesses. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":240.65,"image":{"id":1906068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fishing nets and paint for her fishing boat;

her faith and integrity. Honesty is expected of her when she operates any business or endeavor. Wilma reminds herself about this always and she keeps up her faith to be a good example. She is married to Nardenito, a pastor, and they have children. They live in Talisay City, Cebu where Wilma operates a food stall for additional income. It is a known fact that being a pastor is a vocation, and monetary return is limited. Good thing is, a pastor\u2019s family is rich in love and care from their parishioners. \r\n\r\nWilma embarked on food stall business as additional income generating venture. She maximizes her cooking talent, and even the limited space in front of their house becomes useful. This is where she displays the cooked food, packed into servings for sale. This is more practical for her as she doesn\u2019t need to maintain a big space for customers to eat, no need for eating utensils and equipments, no need for dishwashers or food servers. Her regular customers are her neighbors, the local community, students and working people. Profit derived from her business helps a lot in their daily expenditures but she still needs to save a lot for her children\u2019s education. She\u2019s planning to cook more meal recipes now that the school year already begun. More students are expected to buy from her and it will boost her income. This is why she prays for PhP 10,000 additional capital. She will use this to buy more quantities of meat, fish, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. May God knocks at your compassionate heart and may you be a blessing to her.\r\n\r\nWilma aspires that someday, she would be financially capable of helping others. She also wants to continue serving God together with her whole family. She is an inspiration to her co-fellowship members at CCT who regularly meet every week to reflect of God\u2019s Words and share stories about life and their businesses. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

This is Muhammed. He is the Head teacher of University Link High School, a mixed school in the Urban area of Mbalewith 1000 students. University Link School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

She sells sugar, candy, cookies and other food. She enjoys interacting with clients as well as the very process of buying and selling. She works hard to provide for her family. She does her best to put bread on the table. \r\n\r\nDilorom was born in Shahrituz in 1967. She lives in a village with her family. Her elder sons are working in Russia because they did not manage to find suitable jobs in Tajikistan.

This loan will help Gita's family to take the first step towards a financially secure and stable future.\r\n\r\nGita is grateful to her generous lenders for the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1906584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more grocery items for their grocery shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Falakata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2015-06-19T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-19T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-06-19T18:48:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":903309,"name":"Roqiya","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"   \u0415\u0435 \u0437\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0442 \u0420\u043e\u043a\u0438\u044f. \u0415\u0439 54 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u0420\u043e\u043a\u0438\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u041a\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0451\u043d \u0438 \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0436\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u0420\u043e\u043a\u0438\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0443, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435. \u0420\u043e\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e 3 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0433\u043e\u0434 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0442\u043e\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b. \u0420\u043e\u043a\u0438\u044f \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c. \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0443, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044c\u044f \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d. \u0420\u043e\u043a\u0438\u044f \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0437\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d \u0438 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0430.","en":"This woman is called Roqiya.

So she seeks a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to buy a dairy cow, which will allow her to sell more milk.

His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 1100 USD for purchasing all needed machinery and equipment for opening a car wash service. \r\n\r\nAfter the business is started, the family will have stable source of additional income and the family members will make savings for further well-being. Vano and his wife rely on the good will of Kiva lenders and will be very thankful for the support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":170.01,"image":{"id":1906680,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

These women want to create a future where they can meet the economic needs of their families, send their children to school and generate more income. The \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d program of Friendship Bridge, that combines small loans and educational trainings, is an effective vehicle for them to make progress toward these goals. They find the educational trainings to be very helpful that they receive in their monthly trainings. A Facilitator from the organization, shares beneficial information with the women in their own native language about the world around them and within them. The women learn through role playing, stories and drawings. Some topics discussed include hygiene, health and the use of medicinal plants, self-esteem and empowerment as well as teenage pregnancy and violence against women. The ladies learn to effectively manage their loans and expand their small businesses with information about budgeting, pricing, marketing, customer service and accounting.\n\nRosa is a member of the Trust Bank with one son. She is a street vendor and sells beauty products as well as donuts. She is soliciting a new loan that she will use to buy beauty products like creams, lotions, powders, perfumes and make up. Rosa will use another part of her loan to buy flour for her donut business. She is very pleased to be making an income as she can send her son to school.

Su negocio lo realiza en la zona \u2018San Nicol\u00e1s\u2019, \ncaracterizada por encontrarse en un \u00e1rea central donde existen los cruces de calle para dirigirse a otras zonas alejadas, De clima frio y seco con una temperatura que var\u00eda durante el d\u00eda entre 0-12 grados cent\u00edgrados.\nJisela es de piel morena, ojos pardos, cabello negro largo trenzado, baja estatura, su forma de vestir es tradicional (sombrero, manta y pollera), y su lengua materna es el Aymar\u00e1 que se habla en el lugar y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y por el negocio que realiza. Su vida la comparte con su pareja que trabaja y con sus hijas que estudian en la escuela, viven en una casa propiedad de la familia construida de ladrillo y cemento con techo de calamina y piso de madera. Su negocio es la elaboraci\u00f3n de mantas de vicu\u00f1a; su trabajo consiste en caminar largas distancias en el altiplano en busca de lana de vicu\u00f1a, la cual asea para luego hilvanarla, una vez que tiene suficiente lana se dispone a tejerla en un telar. La labor es netamente artesanal y cada manta lleva un promedio de 2 a 3 semanas en terminarla. \u201cinicie mi negocio hilando las lanas, poco a poco aprend\u00ed el arte de tejer y ahora soy independiente\u2026\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que trabaja en su casa permitiendo cuidar a sus hijas, la desventaja es la falta de una m\u00e1quina para hilar la lana reci\u00e9n cortada. Su sue\u00f1o es abrir una tienda de tejidos, ella desea realizar la compra de una m\u00e1quina para hilar lana y lana de vicu\u00f1a por mayor para aumentar su producci\u00f3n. Esta es la primera secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 4 a\u00f1os que lleva realizando esta actividad de forma independiente. \nEs por esos motivos que Jisela solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de una m\u00e1quina hiladora de lana y lana por mayor para aumentar su producci\u00f3n y abrir una tienda.\n","en":"Jisela, 40, has a partner and 3 daughters, 11-, 8- and 6-years old, respectively.  She operates a business making and selling wool mantas, the traditional outer garments that many people here wear.  She is a good mom, enterprising, sincere, generous, responsible and hard-working.  She operates her business in San Nicol\u00e1s, a crossroads of sorts in central Bolivia.  The climate here is cold and dry with average day-time temperatures that range from 0- to 12-degrees, Centigrade, or 32- to 54-degrees, Fahrenheit.\r\nJisela is brown-skinned with brown eyes and long black hair that she wears braided.  She wears traditional clothing that includes a sombrero and manta.  She speaks Aymar\u00e1, her native language, and Spanish.  She lives with her partner, who also works, and her daughters, who are all in school.  The family lives in their own house.  It's a brick and cement house with a metal roof and wood floors.  \r\nJisela uses vicu\u00f1a wool to weave her mantas.  She travels far and wide across the Altiplano to buy the wool that she uses to make thread.  When she has enough, she weaves the threads together on her loom to make a manta.  The work requires a flair for this traditional craft and each manta takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks to complete.  \"I started out only making thread, then graduated to weaving and now I do it all . . . \", she says.  The advantage of the business, she adds, is that it allows her to both work at home and care for her children at the same time.  \r\nJisela's biggest challenge is turning wool to thread efficiently.  She wants to open a store, selling textiles, but she needs a machine to make bulk supplies of the thread she needs.  She has operated her business for 4 years now and is applying for a loan, her first, to buy a machine for turning wool to thread.  The investment will allow her to produce the volume of thread that she needs to open her own store."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":260.15,"image":{"id":1899388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy equipment and supplies for her weaving business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-19T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-19T17:30:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jisela Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-13T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-12T04:00:00Z","amount":331.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T04:00:00Z","amount":339.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T04:00:00Z","amount":360.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T04:00:00Z","amount":358.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":401.12},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T04:00:00Z","amount":403.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T04:00:00Z","amount":417.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T04:00:00Z","amount":446.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T04:00:00Z","amount":450.76},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T04:00:00Z","amount":485.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T04:00:00Z","amount":502.96},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T04:00:00Z","amount":503.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.49},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.7},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.36},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.34},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.93},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.23,"local_amount":332.65,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":333.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344623},{"amount":49.2,"local_amount":339.31,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:13Z","rounded_local_amount":339.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554838},{"amount":52.13,"local_amount":359.45,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":360.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468925},{"amount":52.15,"local_amount":359.64,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":360.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296758},{"amount":58.44,"local_amount":403.01,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:52Z","rounded_local_amount":403.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076917}],"funded_date":"2015-06-19T19:17:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":902675,"name":"Mujeres Luquenas Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMujeres Luque\u00f1as\u201d is on their very first loan cycle.

She works hard, along with her husband, to generate enough income to send all the children to school, as she realizes that having a good education is a vital key to a successful future. Rosa has a traditional textile business and fabricates colorful blouses or \u201chuipiles\u201d and napkins or \u201cservilletas.\u201d She also sells snacks. The responsibilities of both of these businesses are shared by family members. Rosa is requesting a loan that she will use to buy high quality thread for her beautiful \u201chuipiles.\u201d She will use another portion of the loan to buy ingredients for her snack business.\r\n\r\nThrough the educational program of Friendship Bridge, Rosa and her friends in the Trust Bank are learning about the world around them and within them. Each month at their meetings, a facilitator from the organization shares practical information with them about relevant subjects like effective business practices, savings and indebtedness, violence against women, and teenage pregnancy. These informational sessions are given in the native indigenous language of the women using games, role playing, and diagrams. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe women of the \u201cMujeres Luquenas\u201d Trust Bank are on more solid ground because of their perserverance and access to capital and education.

Birobiya is not only raising them on her own, she also works alone in order to provide for her children. It is hard for her to raise them and work alone, but despite everything Birobiya only moves forwards. She lives for her children and tries very hard. Birobiya engages in one type of business: she goes around houses and sales cloth and children's clothes.
