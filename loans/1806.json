This is Esther. She is the Head teacher of Buckley High Primary School, a girls school in the Urban area of Iganga with 450 students. Buckley School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining two UV water filtration systems to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase two UV water treatments system with two 450 litre tanks, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nBuckley School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

As a Mapan agent, Jerris is responsible for processing deposits from customers into their Mapan accounts as well as receiving orders from customers who want to buy products listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer orders, Jerris will submit the order via SMS and, within 5-10 days, the product will be delivered to the customer.

He lives there with his wife and his only son. Mahpudin owns a stall that sells mobile airtime credits to his community.

His community sees him as an informative, funny, kind and trusted mobile provider. \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Mahpudin needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits to his community. Mahpudin\u2019s goal towards Ruma in the near future is to serve an e-commerce business for his community, a Ruma\u2019s latest product called Mapan, so later on, his community can have access to better products with lower prices.

West Bengal. She is blessed with two children (one son and one daughter). The daughter is married and son works in a ration shop. Soma has received education till grade 3. Unfortunately she had lost her husband few years ago, so she is the breadwinner of the family. \n\nThe only source of income for her family is a small grocery store. Soma looks after the store. She sells things of daily necessity like biscuits, flour, oil, sugar, salt etc. but the income is hardly enough to cover her family's needs. Of late, having been hit by high inflation and an unbalanced monthly income, she could hardly think of savings for the future. With the growing costs of the essential commodities, Soma wants to increase her income and planned to expand her business.  So she applied a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to buy more stock of inventories like sugar, edible oil, spices, cookies, etc. in a bulk. \n\nShe hopes she will ensure her family safeguarding against losses from illnesses and other emergencies with the help of the business profit.

Three years ago it fell to Alvaro to take charge of the business where he works from 8am to 6pm every day. These circumstances motivated him to face his fears and to go beyond his daily tasks in order to demonstrate that he has potential for innovative growth.\n\nOne of his personal projects is to train himself to give himself the knowledge he needs to achieve his vision for the business, which is to expand it and have a good infrastructure. For the time being he needs to buy some flat sewing machines which will enable him to achieve the quality of finish demanded by his clientele.

He is 44 years old, and has 2 children. His son is 23 years old, and his daughter is 19 years old. Mansurjon is a responsible man, true to his word, and always finishes his work on time. He works making earthen ovens. Almost every person who lives in a village uses an earthen oven, because they have no electricity. It is their means of preparing food.\r\n\r\nMansurjon learned this work from an artisan, and to this day uses his advice on the job. Mansurjon's son helps him. Mansurjon is teaching him this occupation, and quietly passing his trade on to him. Mansurjon does not ask much money for his work, because he understands that the local residents have very little money.\r\n\r\nThe reason that Mansurjon has applied to borrow money is so he can get some tools for his work. The tools he is using now have become too worn out to use. His own income is not enough to allow him to buy tools for him and his son.

Chandana sells saris to her neighbors, relatives and friends from her home. A sari is a traditional women's garment consisting of a length of cotton or silk elaborately draped around the body.

As Chandana has a good relationship with her customers, she needs to buy more saris to satisfy them according to their seasonal demand. But the lack of adequate capital is the major problem for her. So she took a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to increase the inventory with varieties of saris for her business. \r\n\r\nShe hopes the variety in the stock will attract more customers and she will earn more profit. It will enable her to create the financial stability for her family\u2019s well being.

Three are already married, two of her brothers are working in Manila as custom and a security guard, two sisters are working as housemaids in Bacolod City, one has her own small business, and the youngest is in college. Their total monthly family income of PHP 18,000 ($404) is barely enough to provide for all their basic needs. This motivates Honeylyn to find means to help the family have more income and that\u2019s why she braved the selection process of Bagosphere and successfully passed it to qualify for the two-month training program that could lead to a call center job. Apart from helping her family, Honeylyn\u2019s ultimate goal is to have a successful career in the BPO industry, to develop her communication skills, to learn new languages, to uplift her family from poverty and to help the less fortunate.

He has pensioner parents, 2 sons, 2 daughter-in-laws and wife. His income, however, is not enough to meet the basic needs of this large family. With the help of his family members Pakhrad is extensively engaged in agribusiness, which is the most important source of his family's income. For more than 15 years, Pakhrad has been involved in cultivation of greens. They sell the agricultural products in the local market. As it becomes harder to earn a living over time, Pakhrad wants to start additional business in order to more effectively meet the daily costs of his family. \r\n\r\nA loan of 5000 GEL will be a great support to this hard-working man and his family, enabling him to purchase wedding dresses and hire out it among local people.\r\nThis credit will be a great support for the family. Pakhrad is thankful to Kiva Lenders for giving him a chance to generate more income. The family members rely on the goodwill of the lenders and will highly appreciate their support.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.  For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.  Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.
