Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He developed his business in the community of \"Vichaya\", which is characterized by its large plains, where the community plants Vichayas to earn an income.

The climate is cold and dry the entire year, with temperatures during the day ranging between -1\/16 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nDavid has a dark complexion, brown eyes and short black hair.

He lives with his family, who work in the same business. They live in their own house, built out of adobe, with a roof of corrugated iron. The house has electricity and water, which is extracted from a well with an electric pump.\r\n\r\nHis business is the production of stucco, a fine powder consisting of lime, marble, gypsum, natural pigments etc., which when mixed with water hardens and is used to cover walls and ceilings. \u201cI started working as an assistant.

She comes from Managua, and is characterized by her sense of responsibility, her hard-working attitude and her dreams of self-improvement. Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources, this young mother wasn't able to finish her education and now she fights day by day to provide her children with the life opportunities which she couldn't have. She fights to get ahead with her business, improve it, get more customers and satisfy their demands.\r\nThanks to her drive to get ahead she owns a business which is a small cafe located in one of the local children's hospitals.

Nevertheless, her interest in becoming a professional in this trade quickly paid off. Through a state institution, she was able to broaden her knowledge, and thanks to this, today she offers a whole variety of hair treatments, haircuts, hair color, and more.\r\n\r\nGraciela is very dedicated and committed to her work and her home. Every day of the week, she sets appointments with her clients that permit her to do her work and be able to look after her four children, three of which are under eighteen. \r\n\r\nIn order to expand her beauty services, she is requesting a Kiva loan, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will purchase a blow dryer and a flat iron. This investment will allow her to increase her client base, since there was a neglected market because she did not have these tools of the trade. \r\n\r\nHer personal goal for the future is to have her own house, and her goal for success is to open her own beauty salon."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":82.87,"image":{"id":1898257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to buy a hair dryer and a straightening iron.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Arjona (Bolivar)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-06-20T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-20T18:10:04Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.35,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40097},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":54050},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":55671},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":57342},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":59062},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":60834},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":62659},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":64538},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66475},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":68469},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":70523},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90280}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.04},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.62},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.94},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.06},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.82},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.59},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.39},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":15.44,"local_amount":40097,"processed_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":41869.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.6,"payment_id":696560928},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":109721,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":114570.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.23,"payment_id":711475652},{"amount":21.42,"local_amount":57342,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:23:19Z","rounded_local_amount":59876.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.52,"payment_id":752082478}],"funded_date":"2015-07-16T20:24:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cara Goman","image":1345692}},{"id":903248,"name":"Virginita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virginita is 53 years old and married, with one child who still attends school.

Your loan will be very useful to help Hariyanto improve his business and, accordingly, his community, which needs access to such services. \r\n\r\nHariyanto's goal in the near future is to serve an e-commerce business for low communities, so his community can have access to better products with lower prices.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nKing of Kings J.

This is Michael. He is the Head teacher of Iganga Boys Primary School, a mixed school in the Urban area of Iganga with 600 students. Iganga Boys School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nIganga Boy's School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Michael ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":212.5,"image":{"id":1907602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

questions by a staff member of the Institute: This is her story:1.\tWhat do you study at the Maharishi Institute? Which classes do you enjoy the most? I am studying a Bachelor of Arts in business administration. I am doing my fourth year. The class that I enjoy the most is Algebra because it is the most challenging and interesting at the same time.\r\n\r\n2.\tWhat are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? Please be specific: in which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel? After graduating I hope to work in the finance department, which is the field that I am interested in. I also want to open my own business so that I can support my family and improve other people\u2019s lives. \r\n\r\n3.\tTell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children? I am Phumla originally from the Eastern Cape, currently staying Carletonville in Johannesburg. I am 31 years old and the mother of two children. I am the third born from a family of eight. I am the bread winner at home, even though I study full time. I had to find better work in order to support my family, which is why I decided to further my education because I know that education will open doors for me.\r\n\r\n4.\tWhat do you like to do in your spare time? During my leisure time I go to people\u2019s homes where I volunteer my time into help them in whatever way they need assistance. I also read books and watch television.\r\n5.\tHow will Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: will there be significant changes? A Kiva loan will change my life in  a positive way because I will be able to come to school without worrying and stressing about school fees. It will help  in terms of transport money too. I will be able to come early, as I have been struggling to come to school on time. This loan will have a huge impact in my lifestyle as I will be able to be a better student in terms of academics.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":16.33,"image":{"id":1907569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for one year tuition fees and living expenses at the Maharishi Institute.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

She then goes to her sewing machine and starts sewing school uniforms. Due to the constant blackouts caused by the electricity load shedding, Jane has to sew the uniforms using her manual sewing machine in candle light. Although her eyes have been affected by years of straining from sewing in a dimly lit room, Jane remains strong and continues working for her family.\r\n\r\nJust as the first rays of the sun start emerging in the blue June sky, she leaves her work and prepares breakfast for her four children. When her children leave home for school, Jane goes to the market, were she does most of her work. At the market place, where many other tailors operate, Jane finds some of her customers already waiting for the uniforms and others for placing orders for more uniforms. Most of her customers sell these uniforms in the rural areas at more affordable as prices compared to those charged in shops. \r\n\r\nJane has been in this business for more than 10 years now. She has two girls under her employ, helping her with sewing and selling the uniforms. She markets her business through word of mouth and going from school to school advertising the uniforms she sews. Jane has received many tenders from schools and colleges that are interested in her work. Her challenge is the lack of funding to buy the adequate material to sew these uniforms. Along with her friends who are also tailors, they formed a group called Bridgeview.

Just nearby, she has a small stall selling second-hand clothes that she buys from Mozambique. \r\n\r\nBeing a single mother, she has to work hard to send her four children to school and feed them. She wants to grow her business and make some physical improvements to her stall to protect her from the sun. \r\n\r\nMiriam is part of a group called Excellent Sisters. The group is taking a second loan from Thrive Microfinance. They have a good payment history, and they want to take their businesses to a higher level.

Her husband is responsible for fulfilling the needs of the entire family. Her husband needs to maintain his taxi because the current condition of his taxi is not good; it requires more maintenance on a daily basis. Due to insufficient financial means her husband is unable to maintain his taxi. Therefore Mussarat has applied to Kiva for a loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan Mussarat's husband can afford the maintenance easily. He will then be able to provide better transport facilities and earn a profitable income. Mussarat also plans to make savings with the profits from her husband's income to meet her family's needs in the future.\r\n\r\nMussarat is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC

They have five children, ages 1, 5, 7, 10 and 12 years. She's a good mother, independent, consistent, optimistic, responsible, and very hard-working. She runs a business selling socks, gloves, and underpants from a mobile cart. She runs her business in the southern part of the city, an area that receives most of the migrants coming from the country to the city. Commerce in the area is predominantly small-time retail and informal. The climate is warm and subtropical with daytime temperatures varying from 21-35C degrees (70-95F).\r\n\r\nSilvia has brown skin and brown eyes and long dark hair that she wears tied back at her neck. She is short and of medium build. Her speaks her native language of Guaran\u00ed at home and with family and speaks Spanish in public and to run her business. She shares her life with her partner, who works in construction, and with her children, who are all in school except for the youngest. They live in a brick and cement home with a laminated metal roof and a tile floor and have running water, electricity, and sewer services.\r\n\r\nFor her business, she sells undergarments including gloves, boxers, socks, leggings, and more.  \"I travel with my business, carrying all my merchandise as well as my little one,\" she says. One advantage of her business is that she's independent and can care for her baby son. The disadvantage is that she doesn't have the capital she needs to stock her business and offer more variety. Her goal is to open a store selling clothing.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy men's underwear to stock her business, and with the profit from these sales, she will pay for her baby's vaccinations. This is her first loan sequence with the institution and she has three years of experience with the business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":338.18,"image":{"id":1900655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"pay her baby's medical expenses by buying and selling men's undergarments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-21T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-21T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-13T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":427.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":431.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":443.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":463.14},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":478.89},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":512.32},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T04:00:00Z","amount":530.19},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T04:00:00Z","amount":547.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":576},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":589.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.85},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.53},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.18},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.4},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.08,"local_amount":427.21,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":438.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344625},{"amount":64.68,"local_amount":431.2,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":443.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554842},{"amount":66.55,"local_amount":443.65,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":455.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468929},{"amount":69.47,"local_amount":463.14,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:13Z","rounded_local_amount":475.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296762},{"amount":73.4,"local_amount":489.36,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":502.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076919}],"funded_date":"2015-06-23T11:02:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":903517,"name":"Lorlyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorlyn works hard to support her family.

Ni Kadek hopes that for next six months the pigs will have a good growth that will increase sales results.\r\nObviously the results obtained will be used to meet the cost of living as well as their children's school fees.

Her variety store sells various commodities like canned goods, candies, chips, biscuits, sachets of shampoo and conditioner, packs of condiments and spices, and many others. \r\n\r\nPiso Net is a coin-operated internet PC with typical rental fee of PHP 1 every four minutes. It is a budget-friendly internet caf\u00e9 suitable for short time internet users. Her income from these businesses can help provide for their everyday needs. But her children are still studying in college, thus she plans to add another additional enterprise. \r\n\r\nShe is a trained sewer or dressmaker and she wants to harness this talent. She intends to buy a sewing machine so she can sew some ready-to-wear clothes while she looks after her variety store and Piso Net. A hardworking mother indeed! She can exert all efforts just to provide for her children\u2019s needs and education and give them better life someday. In due time, she dreams of having a bigger store, more PCs for Piso Net, and a ready-to-wear production business. \r\n\r\nShe is hoping that you can contribute and help her take some steps towards achieving her dreams through a loan assistance of PHP 45,000 that she will use to buy a sewing machine. This loan will make her more productive. She is a compliant member of CCT Credit Cooperative and meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to inspire and strengthen each other through the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Sari-sari (a Filipino term for variety) stores sell different products like biscuits, candies, canned goods, noodles, toiletries and many other items that are needed in an individual\u2019s daily life. This is considered as one of the most common businesses built by ordinary people since it provides commodities for people.\r\n\r\nSusan was enticed to run this kind of enterprise. She is 55 years old, married with children, and a resident of Bacolod City, Negros Occidental. Her income from the store helps provide for their daily expenditures. However, due to competition in this kind of business, her income has become unstable. Hence, she plans to add alternative businesses like mineral water distribution and rice selling. She will buy sacks of rice at wholesale price, and then she\u2019ll retail it per kilo. It will add some profit for her. Moreover, mineral water distribution is in demand nowadays. Susan thinks that it is a good enterprise to venture into. \r\n\r\nSusan is in need of PHP 30,000 additional capital to buy sacks of rice and containers of mineral water. Someday she hopes to put up several branches of her store that will surely give her family the comfortable life that God wants for His children.

One has to undergo breaking, forming again, shaping, spinning, heating and removing of unnecessary fluids that lead to permanent changes like hardening and strengthening of a beautiful outcome, a pot or a vessel. A person\u2019s experiences and trials will also result in his\/her intensified vigor if handled properly. After all those hardships, a person can be a beautiful channel of blessings to others. \r\n\r\nIt is interesting that Cristy chose to venture into a pottery business. She has deeply appreciated the processes that happened before she can touch these products. She can compare it to her changed life. Now, she has the capacity to help others by employing them in her pottery shop located in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental. She has three workers who create earthenware products. There are various shapes of pots, jars, vases, and vessels which are attractive to both local and visiting buyers. However, the income from this business is not always promising. Cristy knows it; that is why she also invested in a tricycle. \r\n\r\nCristy is single but she has dependents who are studying in college. Single persons in the Philippines are expected to help their parents, siblings, or siblings\u2019 children. As a good daughter, Cristy assumes responsibilities for her family. \r\n\r\nNow that she finds difficulty in reserving raw materials for pottery, she desires to have a loan assistance of PHP 51,000 to buy a volume of raw materials. She will also use part of the loan to pay her workers. Payment for volume pottery orders from her shop comes late at times, and she needs to adjust so her workers\u2019 salary won\u2019t be affected.\r\n\r\nCristy is a devoted member of CCT Credit Cooperative and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1006.27,"image":{"id":1907354,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy a volume of raw materials for her pottery business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacolod City, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-21T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-21T10:10:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristy Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":51000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":191.68,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":8645.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314655},{"amount":191.68,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":8645.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523381},{"amount":191.68,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":8645.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433810},{"amount":239.59,"local_amount":10625,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10806.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954729},{"amount":191.64,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":8645.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044641}],"funded_date":"2015-06-21T19:28:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":903581,"name":"Letecia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Letecia is a married woman with six children.

She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are a source for them to meet their daily expense and to send her child to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nEvelyn dreams of expanding her store to give her child a college education to allow her better opportunities in life.

As a result, Fidel will increase his income and will be able to improve his quality of life and that of his family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1900787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to maintain and cultivate one hectare of coffee","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pimpingos - Cutervo - Cajamarca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2015-06-21T13:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-21T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Fidel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2048.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752075021}],"funded_date":"2015-06-21T18:22:36Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:01:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gemma Kern","image":null}},{"id":903377,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":55,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase stocks of maize for milling so as to meet client demands for maize flour.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2015-06-21T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-21T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2678.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681675121},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:33:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2678.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711696886}],"funded_date":"2015-06-23T13:23:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":902949,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is a 46-year-old, married mother of seven children, one of whom is still in school. \r\n\r\nSusan is in the agriculture business, pig fattening in the Philippines.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She knew Ruma through a Ruma sales executive who came to her house. She decided to join Ruma because she wants to try to become an entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Wiwi is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits to her community. Your loan will be very useful to help Wiwi improve her business, which in turn benefits members of her community who need access to such services. In the near future, Wiwi hopes to work with Ruma on its latest product: Mapan, an e-commerce business for low-income communities.

He owns a stall that sells mobile airtime credits to his community. He joined Ruma last year and was introduced to Ruma by a Ruma sales executive who came to his stall. He decided to join Ruma because he wants to learn about how to become an entrepreneur, as well as to increase his revenue and savings so someday he can continue to expand his business in another sector. His community sees him as a trusted and informative mobile airtime provider. \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Budi needs additional capital so he is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva lenders. He will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits to his community. Budi's goal  in the near future is to offer an e-commerce business for lower communities, Ruma's latest product called Mapan, so later on, his community can have access to better products with lower prices.
