Bengal. She is a mother of two children (a daughter and a son). They read in grade 10 and 2, respectively. Mamani studied till grade 5. \r\n\r\nShe runs her own small sewing business from her home. She is a good seamstress and has good experience in this field. She purchases fabrics, cut pieces of cloth, threads and other sewing materials from the wholesale market and makes many kinds of readymade garments, like ladies nightwear, salwars, blouses, petticoats, frocks, etc. After she makes these products, her husband supplies them to the local garment shops.

Isaac has been running his money transfer business in one of the townships called Zingalume in Lusaka, Zambia since November, 2014. He is requesting for a loan in order to purchase the two trading kiosk which he is currently using and to provide the funds needed to serve customers. The loan will also be used to employ one person to help serve customers faster. \r\n\r\nAccess to financial services in Zambia is both scarce and expensive. Close to 10 million Zambians, do not have bank accounts. Distance and transportation factors hinder access to available financial services. Zoona is a company that specializes in low-cost mobile money and other financial transaction services by propagating an open network using small businesses called Agents. \r\n\r\nIsaac is one of the Agents, he earns a profit for every transaction that he makes at the kiosks. This is his story: When Isaac first started his business his main focus was to get people in his community to know about the service that he provides. He started off by doing direct sales to customers in his community by distributing flyers and explaining his business to them in person. His strategy paid off because barely a month later his transactions had increased from a mere 10 transactions a day to 30 transactions a day. He then set up his second outlet and because of the quick growth of his business he faces the challenge of working float (electronic and cash value of his working capital) which means he does not have enough working capital to satisfy his customers from time to time. He frequently has to close his shops and make trips to the bank to convert his electronic money to cash and vice versa.\r\n \r\nIsaac is certain that purchasing his trading kiosks so that he can own them and the capital injection in his business will help him grow his business and earn more profits. The profits will help him to provide basic needs for his family, as the business is his only source of income.

It serves as key ingredients of cooking food with flavor and color and also is used as medicine. As per customers' demand, Rama wants to enhance her family-run business for more income.

business partner. He and his wife work hard to provide income to meet their family\u2019s daily personal and household needs.<br \/><br \/>Cesar operates a variety store which his wife has managed for a number of years already. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. He earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from their small general store, Cesar also operates a tricycle which carries four passengers and brings them to their destination either to a town market, church, or a friend's house and or to schools. He is shown in his photo with his tricycle. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of Php 2000 in sales every day. <br \/><br \/>To help him continue operations of his business he is requesting a Php 10,000 loan which he will use to buy grocery items such as sacks of rice, corn rice, charcoal, sugar, cooking oil, and beverages and partly for the maintenance of his tricycle. He is positive this will boost his income as he expands his business. He is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given him.<br \/><br \/>Cesar dreams that his small store will become a bigger grocery store someday. He prays for good health and life. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies. <br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":215.63,"image":{"id":1908338,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Wanting to give them a better living condition in the future, she\u2019s doing her best to enhance her direct selling business. She dreams that all her children will finish schooling because she knows that it\u2019s the only inheritance that she can bestow on them. A college diploma will be the first step to their success.\r\n\r\nFlorentina resides in Santa Barbara, Iloilo with her husband Ruperto and their six children. Ruperto is a laborer with irregular income. Aside from this, he is already 63 years old. At his age, his strength declines but he cannot retire yet because they have three children in college.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why Florentina wants to enhance her direct selling business. She has to work hard to supplement the needs of the whole family. However, her stock is very limited and it will also give her limited income. Thus she appeals for a PHP 11,000 loan to buy additional products like food supplements, toiletries, apparel, shoes and bags. This will surely increase her profit and will help provide for their everyday needs and children\u2019s education. You\u2019ll be a great blessing in advance. Thanks for your heartfelt generosity and goodness. \r\n\r\nFlorentina meets with her fellowship group* every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups, each composed of 15 to 30 community partners, that gather each week to study the

Which classes do you enjoy the most?\r\nI am a BBA student, currently doing an English composition class that is truly interesting and fun, equal educational.\r\n\r\n2.\tWhat are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? Please be specific: in which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\nMy plans are to gain some working experience in the financial sector before venturing into my own business in the near future. Firstly I want to establish my business here in Gauteng then take it (expand) provincially then be global, which will constitute me to travel.\r\n\r\n3.\tTell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children?\r\nI am 32 year old male (1983\/12\/20) and the only child my mother could be able to have. I was raised by her alone with the help of my grandmother. Currently she is working part time as a cleaner, as she is helping out a few members of the family to get through school. I am not married but have four kids that live with me and their mother. They inspire me to go on in life and I want to be a living and shining example to them.\r\n\r\n4.\tWhat do you like to do in your spare time?\r\nI love people and charity work; hence I am involved on part of 4 charity organizations. So I spend most of my time doing work at community centers.\r\n \r\n5.\tHow will Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: will there be significant changes?\r\nCurrently I am supporting myself in terms of my studies. Being a full time student makes it hard to get a part time employment and that makes it more difficult for me with transport money.

Su negocio lo desarrolla en la zona \u2018Urbari\u2019 que es un \u00e1rea de la ciudad espec\u00edficamente delimitada, cuyo uso de suelo ha sido asignado para la edificaci\u00f3n y asentamiento de actividades industriales, de clima c\u00e1lido sub tropical con una temperatura que var\u00eda durante el d\u00eda entre 21-35 grados cent\u00edgrados.\nDeisy es de tez trigue\u00f1a, ojos pardos, cabello casta\u00f1o largo lo usa amarrado por detr\u00e1s, baja estatura, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica mediana, su lengua materna es el Guaran\u00ed que habla en familia y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y por el negocio que realiza (sentada al centro).

Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 2 a\u00f1os que desarrolla esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Deisy solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de ropa de segunda mano por mayor para abrir un puesto de venta nuevo. \n","en":"Deisy, who is 50, is married and has five children, aged 18, 23, 25, 27 and 29. She works selling secondhand clothing. She is a good mother, and is enterprising, independent, determined, committed, responsible and very hard-working. She works in the 'Urbari' district, which is an area of the city which has been specifically classified for construction and industry. It has a sub-tropical climate, and the temperature ranges from 21 to 35 degrees celsius.\r\n\r\nDeisy has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long brown hair that she wears tied back, and is short and of medium build. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family, although she also speaks Spanish which is the language she uses for business. (She is seated in the center of the photograph.) She shares her home with her husband who works as a plumber, and her two youngest children who are still studying. Her other children are now independent. Her home, which the family built, is made of bricks and cement with a tin roof and has water, electricity and sewage connection. \r\n\r\nHer desire to excel led her to lead a group of people engaged in different types of businesses, including selling eggs, weaving, bakery, selling fish, selling pies, selling cosmetics and food sales, to ask for a loan in order to improve their businesses. Her business is selling secondhand clothes, such as pants, sweatshirts, t-shirts, shirts, blouses, sweaters, jackets, etc. She needs to supply her business with a wide variety and large quantity of clothing constantly to compete in the market, and also wants to open another stall selling the same items in another market. \"My business needs to increase its stock in order to grow, and the profits will go towards opening another stall\" she says. The advantage of her business is that the sales are constant, but the disadvantage is that she doesn't have the necessary capital to expand her business. Her dream is to have two market stalls, and she wants to invest in buying secondhand clothing wholesale. Deisy has been in business for two years and this is the first loan cycle with the provider. Deisy is asking for a loan to buy secondhand clothing wholesale in order to open a new market stall.

following questions by a staff member of the Institute. This is her story:\r\n\r\n1. What do you study at the Maharishi Institute? Which classes do you enjoy the most? \r\nI am doing a Bachelors of Art in Business Administration. The class I enjoy the most is marketing because, there you can express yourself and become as creative as you like; it does not limit you, but it helps you to think beyond.\r\n\r\n2. What are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? Please be specific: in which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\nMy goals are to obtain my degree so that I can be able to support my siblings. The field I want to work under is the Marketing department because, it will give me more opportunity to travel the world. I would like to work in the USA because I feel there is more opportunity and growth since their country is more developed. Yes, I would love to travel.\r\n\r\n3. Tell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? \r\nI was born in the informal settlement of Daveyton, where a child is exposed to drugs, prostitution and violence, which I feel no child should be raised in an environment like that.\r\nI have three brothers which none of them has been fortunate to study further after matric because of the funds yet at the same time they had to go and look for work so that they can take care of the family.\r\n\r\n4. What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children?\r\nI like reading books because it helps me to be more knowledgeable and expand my thinking capability all the time. So whenever I am free I got the primary schools and offer my services to help up bring kids and read looks for them.\r\n\r\n5. What do you like to do in your spare time? How will Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: Will there be significant changes\r\nYes a lot, it will give me opportunity to arrive at school on time instead of walking distance and end up missing my first class and meditation programme.

Shikha supports her family financially by running a clothing business. \r\n\r\nShe purchases varieties of clothing according to the seasonal demand from a wholesaler and sells them at the retail price in her neighborhood. She mainly sells sarees (a garment traditionally worn by Indian women), but sometimes she also sells other clothing like petticoats, nightwear, blouses, salwar suits, etc., according to the demand of her customers.\r\n\r\nHer customers are gradually increasing day by day. Continuous price rise of the essential goods and the concern of saving for the future have made Shikha think to expand the size of her small-scale business. \r\n\r\nThus she applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, BJS, to buy clothing stock. She is confident that with the help of this loan she will be able to expand her customer base.

She will also sell cow dung, which is good for farm manure and used as fuel in their region.\r\n\r\nTo this end, she applied for a microloan from Kiva's field partner BJS to purchase a dairy cow.

Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Florcefida would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 18,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Florcefida hopes to maintain an increasing profit from her business. She dreams for her family to be always happy and healthy.

Sari-sari (a term used for variety) stores sell different kinds of products from biscuits, candies, canned goods, noodles, products used for personal hygiene and the like which are involved in every individual\u2019s daily living. This is considered as one of the most common businesses built by ordinary people since it provides commodities for people. \r\n\r\nWith this fact, Eulalia was enticed to get in touch with this kind of craft. She is 50 years old, married to Lolito and a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. By now, they are working with determination to pursue the needs of their family. The income they get from the store helps them for their daily expenditures. \r\n\r\nHowever, what profits they get from the business are sometimes insufficient. It is because of this that at times she finds it hard to maintain supplies of various products. This is why she is requesting PHP 50 000 loan that she will utilize to buy additional products for her inventory. With more products displayed in her store, she will have the opportunity to increase in income. \r\n\r\nIn due time, she hopes that she progresses and that her business will see a boost in sales. Through this, she can earn and save money for a house someday if God will allow.

My father left us when I was just four months old. The day he left us we thought he was going to work but he could not come back and instead he decided to stay with his girlfriend. My mother is so supportive and she wants the best for her children and we are going to make her proud.\r\n\r\nIn my spare time I read novels, listen to my favorite music, which is gospel as it brings me closer to my God. I go to church every Sunday and sometimes I help my brother with his homework.\r\n\r\nThe Kiva loan will change my life because I will be able to finish my studies and get my degree and start working.

Which classes do you enjoy the most?\r\nI am studying for a Bachelor of Business Administration. The class that I enjoy the most is the Entrepreneur course.\r\n\r\n2.What are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? Please be specific: in which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\nAfter graduating I wish to work for government sector for 2-3 years, saving money to start my own enterprise. I would like to work in Johannesburg and I enjoy travelling nationally and internationally.\r\n\r\n3.Tell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children?\r\n\r\n I am from a rural area in Limpopo. I was born in a place called Dzumeri village. I am the second-born from a family of four. My mother died when I was 18 years old; my father is self-employed and he is struggling to support us because he is married again with two kids. I was brought up by my grandmother; she was not working and life was not easy for us because we used to go to school with hungry stomachs.\r\n\r\n4.What do you like to do in your spare time? \r\nIn my spare time I go house-to-house in my township, Soweto, selling archaar. I have to work with my hands and I enjoy doing various home repair tasks. I also like reading novels and newspapers sometimes. I visit my family in Alexandra to spend the weekend with them.\r\n\r\n5.How will the Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: will there be significant changes? \r\nThe Kiva loan will change my life because I will be able to pay my education fee and transport to school.

But that never became a hindrance to move forward and reach her dreams. She is already 34 years old now and with her self-will and courage, she's making herself quite busy now in handling her buy-and-sell business. \r\n\r\nAs you can see in the picture, she offers different kinds of products. She sells bags and some accessories like ponytails and other stuff. From here, she gets income that serves as a remedy for her family's (seemingly unending) financial incapacity. \r\n\r\nAt times, there are cases where her sales never meet her expectations. It's really hard when such moments like these come. There are also circumstances when her capital is not enough. And being one of the breadwinners of the family, she doesn't want this business to just end with an unreasonable cause-- insufficiency. \r\n\r\nShe believes that there is always a provision when there is a vision (a dream). This inspiration comes from the people around her that encourage her, including the people that she interacts with every week at a regular fellowship*. (Here, they share, testify and study the word of God.)\r\n\r\nProve to her that what she believes is always true. She's asking now for a loan of 50,000 PHP that she would use in purchasing additional products for her inventory. It's just one small step for you to take to help Maricel. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is comprised of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1031.25,"image":{"id":1908344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to be used in purchasing additional products like bags and accessories for her inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Las Pi\u00f1as","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-22T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-22T01:50:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maricel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":468.8,"local_amount":20833.3,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":21105.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523401},{"amount":140.62,"local_amount":6249.99,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":6331.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433830},{"amount":187.48,"local_amount":8333.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":8442.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954749},{"amount":234.35,"local_amount":10416.65,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":10552.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044654}],"funded_date":"2015-07-17T17:13:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":903987,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is 22 years old and supports one child.

She has two daughters who are 14 and 22, and her business is a neighborhood store.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, strong, tenacious, persevering, and very hard-working. She carries out her business in the southern area of the city, which is next to the city but outside of it. That is, it is outside of the economic, social, or cultural unit that defines the city. The suburb's residents live, organize themselves, build their houses, open their streets, build their schools, deal with their struggles, and die on the margins of the government and its regulations and institutions.\r\n\r\nYolanda is tan with dark eyes and uses eye glasses. She has short dark hair, short stature, and medium build. Her mother language is Quechua, which is spoken in the area, and she speaks Spanish in everyday life and in her business. (She is in the center, wearing a sky blue shirt with black and white stripes and maroon pants.)\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her husband, who works as a non-salaried chauffeur, and with her daughters, who are in school and in college and help her with the business. They live in a house they own, made of brink and cement with a corrugated metal roof and cement floor. It has electricity and drinking water with plumbing.\r\n\r\nHer desire to improve her income impelled her to join a communal bank to request a loan, in order to stock her business and be able to pay her younger daughter's last year of school expenses.\r\n\r\nThe members of the communal bank work in areas such as sewing wool shirts, selling natural medicine, farming, selling food, selling second-hand clothes, a bookstore, and recharging car batteries. She makes her living by selling food and basic necessities such as sugar, bread, rice, noodles, oil, water, soda, cookies, sweets, and others. She sells from her neighborhood shop located in her home, on weekdays during the daytime hours.\r\n\r\nAlongside her store, she has a second occupation as a seamstress. She makes adjustments in size and width, mainly to girls' dresses, and she also makes clothing to order. \"My daughters help me take care of the store when I have clothing orders,\" she says.

She is 47 years old now and has only one child. Flinging herself into managing her current sari-sari (general) store, she is hopeful that in no time she will be able to finally get her dream house and have more businesses as well. But as of now, she is working persistently to provide for the daily needs of her household. \r\n\r\nSari-sari stores are seen everywhere in the Philippines, most especially along the sidewalks and streets. It is most like a convenience store, but quite a bit smaller than the usual and offers only limited products that are commonly needed such as toiletries, food, instants, beverages and other commodities. Unlike grocery stores, sari-sari stores offer products at low cost and on a retail basis, which is really an advantage for the customers.\r\n\r\nMaking headway to improve her sales, Emelita would like to ask for help from you. She would like to borrow 30,000 PHP, which she would use to purchase additional products and merchandise items for her store. With this, she expects to increase her sales and provide a better remedy for her family\u2019s daily living conditions. And, today, you can be a big part of her life. \r\n\r\nShe meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

In her childhood, she was deprived of an education due to the poor economic resources of her family. She can only sign her name. Due to poverty, she was unable to provide an education to her children. Her daughter is married and her son is engaged in small work.\r\n\r\nBishakha's husband is a farmer by profession. He has been associated with cultivation for many years. So, he has acquired lots of experience in farming. Bishakha also assists her husband in the field work. Earlier, they used to grow different types of vegetables and crops in different seasons. But now they thought of growing maize on their farm land. These days, maize is in a lot of demand in markets because of its nutritious value. So, they want to cultivate maize and sell it directly to the village market. Due to the lack of capital, they cannot start this maize cultivation. For that reason, Bishakha applied for a loan from Kiva's field partner BJS to buy agricultural supplies such as seeds, manure, pesticides, etc. to cultivate maize. \r\n\r\nShe hopes this will enable her to ensure the financial stability of their family so that she can fulfill her long cherished dream of building a concrete house for her family\u2019s well-being.\r\n\r\nBishakha thanks BJS and Kiva for their financial support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1908536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase seeds, pesticides and other agricultural supplies for maize cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Falakata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2015-06-22T05:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-22T05:40:03Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bishakha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-06-22T07:24:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":904008,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":27.5,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more stock of vegetables, tomatoes, onions and fruits for selling in hopes this will enable her to serve more customers and make more income to support her family.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2015-06-22T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-22T05:50:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2691.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696764349}],"funded_date":"2015-06-27T05:38:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":904014,"name":"Sima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sima is a very energetic young woman of 28 years from Falakata, a town located in Alipurduar district.

The main reason behind this expansion is that she wants to earn more profit, as it will surely help and support her family in their daily expenses. \r\n\r\nShe really hopes for your helping hands. \r\n\r\nFlorenia dreams of being successful in the years to come. At the same time, she dreams that her grandchildren will finish their studies as well. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of their work. There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":306.26,"image":{"id":1907563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Which classes do you enjoy the most? \r\nI am studying a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration, and I enjoy  Financial Management the most.\r\n\r\n2.\tWhat are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? Please be specific: in which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel? \r\nAfter graduating, I would like to work as a financial advisor in a big company in the Free State (another province in South Africa) so that I can help my family or support them. I would also like to have my own organization where I will be helping orphans and vulnerable children, as I know what it feels like to live without parents and to live in poverty.\r\n\r\n3.\tTell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children?  \r\nI was born in Pimville in Soweto into a family of five. I have three sisters and one young brother. I am the third born in my family. I am staying with my aunt because I lost both my parents when I was five, so my guardian had to take care of us. We are staying at her place with her two children, both girls. My aunt is a domestic worker and she is the only breadwinner in the family. We are all in school.\r\n\r\n4.\tWhat do you like to do in your spare time?\r\nI like to read and write most of the time, when I am not busy.\r\n\r\n5.\tHow will a Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: will there be significant changes? \r\nA Kiva loan will bring a lot of changes in my life because I am going to be able to pay attention to my studies. This is because sometimes, when I don\u2019t have money for transport, I am unable to come to school every day because I struggle with transport money.

following questions by a staff member of the Institute. This is her story:\r\n\r\n1. What do you study at the Maharishi Institute? Which classes do you enjoy the most? \r\nI am studying a Bachelor of Art in Business Administration degree. I enjoy Marketing and Human Resources.\r\n\r\n2. What are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? Please be specific: in which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\nMy goals are to be able to support my family and to be independent. I would prefer to work in the corporate sector where I will be able to use my skills. I would like to work in Pretoria and probably live there.\r\n\r\n3. Tell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? \r\nI was born in Daveyton in Johannesburg, and I have four brothers and two sisters. My biological mother passed away in 2007, so I stay with my father and stepmother. \r\n\r\n4. What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children?\r\nMy father works at the correctional services and my stepmother is between jobs. I am currently single and have no children. \r\n\r\n5. What do you like to do in your spare time? \r\nI like to cook, read inspirational books, go outdoors, and visit my close family and friends.\r\n\r\n6. How will a Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle? Will there be significant changes?\r\nThe Kiva loan will have a huge impact in my life. It will help me to reduce my study fees and that will ease my mind, because I will worry less and will be able to study harder and be much more determined than before. My family will be at ease and stress-free because I come from a struggling family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":16.33,"image":{"id":1908558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for one year of tuition fees and living expenses at the Maharishi Institute.

The classes that I enjoy the most are CBE classes, which focus on building my inner and outer self.\r\n\r\n2. What are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? Please be specific: in which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\nMy short term goal after graduating is to get a permanent job in Sasol. I would like to work as an administrator for a period of 5 years and it must be in Mpumalanga. I love travelling a lot, so being the Personal Assistant of the CEO would also be fine. My long term goal is to own a few flats and rent them. I want to be in the property business.\r\n\r\n3. Tell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children?\r\nI am from Bushbuckridge and am from a family of five. I am the third born. I have two sisters and two brothers. My mother is currently not working, and as for my father I lost contact with him in 2008. I am a mother of three kids, 1 girl and 2 boys, who live in Mpumalanga with their dad. I am single. I grew up with my grandmother, who later died, and I had to learn how to do certain things. Through hard work, I am proud to say that I have made my grandmother proud by completing my matric, and I am now on my way to completing my degree. I have nothing today but tomorrow I\u2019ll be someone.\r\n\r\n4. What do you like to do in your spare time?\r\nI love reading novels so that it can improve my English. What I am reading at the moment is 'Traitor\u2019s Heart' by David Milan, if I am not mistaken. Either that or I go and visit my kids in Mpumalanga and spend some time with them.\r\n\r\n5. How will a Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: will there be significant changes?\r\nThe Kiva loan will change my life in a good way - socially, emotionally and financially, because lately I have been having problems with money and that affects my studies and health as I always have thoughts and questions about how I am going to do things.

She is grateful to the Kiva Fund and to everyone who helped to finance her. Today she has two cows and ten sheep. She grows clover and strawberries for sale on 1.5 hectares of her own land.

The deep family tradition of agricultural practice, the main source of revenue and food for the home, encouraged Balla to become a farmer, He grows corn, millet, and cotton on his 15 hectare plot of land, but, as a farmer, he must cope with difficulties such as lack of rain and agricultural materials. This year, he wanted to buy a seeder to be quick with seeding and fertilizing. That also saves his children the physical labor.

She lives with her husband and children in Jogendrapur village of Falakata in Alipurduar district. Two of her children are students. Jayamani was deprived of education in her childhood due to poverty, but she can sign her name.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a farmer by profession. He has been growing seasonal fruits and vegetables for years. He works hard on his farmland to grow good quality vegetables so that he can satisfy his customers.The local people have high demand for his fresh fruits and vegetables. Jayamani is a homemaker but helps her husband in cultivation whenever she gets time. Their income is hardly sufficient to meet the expenses of their family. \r\n\r\nNow they plan to grow cucumber, as cucumber is the right vegetable to beat scorching summer heat.
