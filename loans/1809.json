following questions by a staff member of the Institute: This is her story:1.\tWhat do you study at the Maharishi Institute? Which classes do you enjoy the most?\r\nI am studying a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration. I like Marketing  Management and I enjoy doing consciousness classes. They help me to build my self-esteem, and know more about nature such as living and non-living things and how we should support nature. \r\n2.\tWhat are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? Please be specific: in which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\nI would like to work in good company that will help me to grow as a person. I will like to work for the Rand Water Board. I will teach people how to save water in order for all of us to have water. I would be happy to travel for my job.\r\n3.\tTell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children?\r\nI was born in Mpumalanga and raised alone by my mother because my grandmother was working as a domestic worker. My mother battled when raising me as she was still at school. She decided not to have anymore children. I am therefore an only child. When I finished high school,  I moved to Johannesburg to stay with my grandmother and I worked for a few years then I decided to join the Maharishi Institute. I always wanted more in life, and I want to be a successful  business woman. In 2011 I was blessed with the baby girl, I named here Lisedi (meaning light of my life). I want to provide for my family and I don\u2019t want to see them suffer.\r\n4.\tWhat do you like to do in your spare time? I like to go out with my friends or stay at home and read a book or watch movies. Then before I go to sleep, I meditate. On weekends I sometimes take my child for games and eat out.\r\n5.\tHow will Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: will there be significant changes? A Kiva loan will help  me with transport fare as I struggle to find money for the whole month.

Her husband works informally as a bricklayer.

Which classes do you enjoy the most?\r\nI am studying a Bachelors degree in Business Administration. I enjoy Project Management, Human Resource Management, ICT and Marketing Management. I also enjoy Philosophy of Consciousness and Sustainable Living.\r\n2.\tWhat are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? Please be specific: in which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel? I want to be project manager where I will be able to do big events. Johannesburg is where I expect to work. Yes, I would like to travel.\r\n3.\t Tell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children? I was born in  Dobsonville in Soweto. I have four brothers and four sisters. I am a single parent of two boys, aged 9 and 10. They are also in school. I live with my mother who is a pensioner. At times it\u2019s even hard to put food on the table, but somehow it always works out. \r\n4.\tWhat do you like to do in your spare time? I read a lot. I also do charity work if I have time,  especially during school  holidays. I also do part time work if there is some available.\r\n5.\tHow will Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: will there be significant changes? There will be significant change because it will help me with money for transport to school. At the moment I sometimes miss school because I can\u2019t afford the transport money, so Kiva is going to change a lot of things.

He is a skilled craftsman with different occasional jobs, but he would prefer a steady income.

They are survivors of Typhoon Haiyan that swept the Philippines, especially Visayas region, in November 2013. \r\n\r\nRosario runs a \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental and she continues to work hard in order to maintain and improve it. However, the income derived from her store varies from time to time as it is usually affected by the competition within the area. Aside from this, she has some neighbors who have the habit of paying later for those items they get. Sometimes it takes a few days or weeks before they pay. The stability of her business is shaken by this practice because it depletes her capital. She is a considerate person who cannot refuse her neighbors, but she also has to earn enough money for their everyday needs and save some amount for their retirement. Self-employed citizens in the Philippines, especially in some remote areas, have no pension or medical benefits when they retire. They have to rely on their own savings or help from other people. Considering all this, Rosario needs to improve her business. She plans to buy more items, particularly soft drinks, beverages and rice. She is requesting additional capital of PHP 40,000 that will surely boost her income and savings. She\u2019s praying that you have a kind heart to extend support to her. It will go a long, long way. \r\n\r\nRosario dreams that all her children will be successful and enjoy a better life in the future. She meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

woman from Tigbauan, Iloilo. She is married to Rogelio, a 67 year old laborer who still accepts manual work despite his age. Rosalinda feels the sacrifices of her husband that\u2019s why she tries to earn a living to help him and support their expenses. She\u2019s selling RTWs or ready-to-wear apparels like clothes, undergarments, shoes and even bags and umbrellas. She also manages her variety store for fifteen years now. \r\n\r\nHowever, the usual dilemma of variety store owners like Rosalinda is the long time debts of some customers that depletes her capital. Even her RTW business suffers the same problem. As of now, she needs additional capital to buy more RTW products like clothes, bags, umbrellas and other supplies in her variety store. A PhP 30,000 loan will help her a lot. She can improve her profit so her husband can already retire from manual work at his age of 67.

Sari-sari means \"variety\". They provide the people with products mostly needed in everyday survival - from products for personal hygiene such as shampoo, toothpaste, and powder, to condiments, foods, canned goods, and other stuff that is merely low-cost. This is why many of those who want to go with a business often start with being a sari-sari vendor, because with just a small amount of capital, you can automatically operate a store and earn. <br \/><br \/>It's just like Remelinda, 36 years old, and from Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila. She began being involved in this kind of business five years ago. And through all those years, she was able to provide her three children a living through the income she gets from the store. What she does is basically buy stuff in a large quantity and then display it at her store and sell it at retail, often at a price that is very affordable for people, but is larger than the original price so she can have a profit. <br \/><br \/>However, you cannot expect a regular and stable income from this, since sales vary from time to time. For this reason, Remelinda wants to ask you for a PHP 50,000 loan that she will use to buy more supplies of products to display in her store. Certainly, this will really help her improve her business and attract more customers. <br \/><br \/>She meets up every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1909272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more supplies of products to display in her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Muntinlupa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-22T20:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-22T20:00:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Remelinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:17:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3372.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314685},{"amount":375,"local_amount":16666.65,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":16862.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523420},{"amount":300,"local_amount":13333.32,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":13489.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433849},{"amount":300,"local_amount":13333.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:38Z","rounded_local_amount":13489.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954768},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.38,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3372.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044666}],"funded_date":"2015-06-23T07:53:47Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":904620,"name":"Louie Jean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Louie Jean is a 28-year-old college undergraduate who lives in Bago City.

You can say that figuratively, computer is like the oxygen everyone needs, from an individual to the biggest institutions within the society.\r\n\r\nThis is why Mary Lou, 51 years old, a resident of Caloocan City, has chosen to make computer as the mainstream of her current business. She is a mother to her one child and she manages her own household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nSo how is she running her business then? In the Philippines, we can expect that most of the population cannot afford to buy their own computer unit. As an ease to this, entrepreneurs like Mary Lou offers PC rentals with automatic access to the internet, basically per hour at a given cost. Usually, price ranges from 10 to 15 PHPs per hour which is a hook to the people for its very inexpensive price. \r\n\r\nHowever, what income Mary Lou gets from her current business is not quite enough to provide all their needs.   So she is planning to expand her business to increase her profit. With this in mind, she is humbly requesting a PHP 15000 loan, which she will utilize to purchase additional computer units and other materials needed for the renovation of her shop. In advance, she would like to say her thanks and deepest appreciation to those who will help her in this vision. \r\n\r\nMary Lou hopes to have a sustainable livelihood in the near future. At the same time, she prays that her children will have a secured future through finishing their schooling. She regularly meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1909313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy computers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-22T20:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-22T20:50:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Lou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.7,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:17:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5246,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314687},{"amount":93.32,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4196.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523422},{"amount":93.32,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4196.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433851},{"amount":46.66,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2098.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954770}],"funded_date":"2015-06-22T23:04:43Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":904643,"name":"Fikile","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fikile is a Business Management student at the Maharishi Institute and was asked the following questions by a staff member of the Institute.

Su comida est\u00e1 compuesta por trozos de carne de pollo tierno, a veces enharinados o rebozados, y luego fritos. Lo que distingue a su pollo frito de otras frituras de pollo es que habitualmente las corta por las articulaciones, dejando los huesos y la piel intactos.

Her business is selling fried chicken. She is a good mother, an entrepreneur, independent, generous, patient, responsible, and hardworking. Her business is developed on itinerant basis in the area 'plan 3000' characterized by  its population's origins; Ayoreas native tribes and relocated western miners took ownership of the area and began manufacturing and trading. With a hot, subtropical and very humid  climate daytime temperatures vary from 21 to 35 degrees centigrade. \n\nAntonia has a dark complexion, brown eyes, wears glasses, long gray hair which she wears tied behind the neck, a short stature and median physical build. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which is spoken in her family; she speaks Spanish as part of general culture and for the trade she is doing. (Antonia is pictured sitting down on the right, wearing the celestial blouse.) She shares her life with her husband, who works, and her independent children who have their own families. They live in their own house, built of brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof and brick floor. At home, they have drinking water, electricity and a sewage system. Due to her need to continue with her activity, she decided to form a group of people with businesses such as selling second hand clothes, selling fruit, selling tomatoes, confection of textiles, selling fish, cleaning services, selling pasties, trading cosmetics, and seasonal clothing sales, in order to request a loan and improve her activities. \n\nHer business is selling fried chicken, an activity performed in a stall in the street in different places. Her food consists of chunks of tender chicken meat, sometimes floured or coated and then fried. What distinguishes her fried chicken from others is that she usually cuts the chicken pieces in the joint, leaving bones and skin intact. The well seasoned crispy skin, without excess fat, is the distinctive feature of her good fried chicken; \"I will open my fixed selling place, for that I need to build the roof to cover from the sun and rain my customers \u2026,\u201d she says. The advantage is that is a fast food business and is consumed daily; the disadvantage is the lack of capital to build the roof. Her dream is to open a place to sell snack of fried chicken. She hopes to build the roof for her new place to sell the fried chicken, in order to cover its customers from the inclement weather. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in the first year and a half that she has been running this activity.\n\nFor these reasons, Antonia is requesting a loan to to build the roof for her new place to sell the fried chicken, in order to cover its customers from the inclement weather.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3259.64,"image":{"id":1892855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

They are led by Manjulaben who is standing in the center. Manjulaben is a 36-year-old mother of 2 children. The household income is INR 12,500 which is insufficient to meet the household expenses and pay for the children's education. The monthly savings are just INR 2,500. Hence Manjulaben thought of starting her business to supplement the family income. <br \/><br \/>Manjulaben started her grocery store business where she sells rice, oil, ghee etc. Through this business she is currently earning INR 5,000. But she wants to earn more to support her children's education. Hence she decided to seek a loan to expand her business. She got together with four other women who share similar interests.

Hence Sabanabibi thought of starting her own business to supplement the family's income. She started her variety store which sells products including bangles, earrings, necklaces, etc. With this business she is currently earning 3,500 INR, but she wants to earn more to support her children's education. \r\n\r\nSabanabibi came up with the idea to avail herself of a loan to expand her business. She got together with four other women who share similar interests. The other women are determined to help their families and want to expand their existing businesses as well. These families earn on average 10,000 INR per month, out of which they are able to save only 2,000 INR. \r\n\r\nSimilar to Sabanabibi, Laliben and Sherbanu are also into selling bangles, earrings, necklaces, etc. They will use the loan to expand their variety store and earn more income. Mumtaj and Sabana are into selling fruits. They sell apples, pears, watermelons, pineapples, oranges etc. and they will use the loan to expand their fruit businesses. \r\n\r\nTogether, the group seeks a loan of 70,000 INR.

She lives her with husband and their three children, who are 3, 9 and 14 years old respectively.  Maria's business is selling cosmetics. \r\n<p>\r\nMaria is a good mother.  She is independent, active, tenacious, friendly, well-mannered, responsible and very hard-working.  She runs her business in the \u2018Paurito\u2019 neighborhood, a rural community located 30 kilometers southeast of the city and 356 meters above sea level.  It is a town of artisans where \"SAO sombreros\" are made; they are wide-brimmed hats made from the fibers of tree leaves. \r\n<p>\r\nMaria is olive-skinned and has brown eyes and chestnut hair, which she wears tied back behind her neck.  She is short and of medium build.  Maria's native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family.  She speaks Spanish when out and about and to run her business. \r\n<p>\r\nMaria shares her life with her husband, who works as a driver, and with her three children.  The two eldest children go to school, and the youngest is not yet school-aged.  They live in their own home, which is built of wood, brick and cement and has a corrugated iron roof and a dirt floor.  They have well-water that is pulled up with a pump and they have electricity.   \r\n<p>\r\nA need to improve her situation brought Maria to lead a communal bank of people with businesses such as: a bakery, electrical services, food sales, making pastries, selling sheets, a tire shop and tea service.  Together they request loans and improve their businesses.  \r\n<p>\r\nMaria is an independent sales woman who guarantees and certifies her products' origins.  Her business is selling catalog cosmetics as a street vendor.  She sells products from Revlon, L'Oreal, Epicare, Max Factor and others.  She travels every day of the week selling at different markets and to businesses in her area.  The products with the greatest demand are quick-drying nail polishes, eye-shadow creams, lip gloss, summertime products and others.  \u201cI intend to offer my customers the best products and the most competitive prices.  I have experience and knowledge in the area of beauty, so I can provide the personal advise my customers may need,\" Maria says.  An advantage of her business is that the majority of her sales are done on orders and by catalog, so she doesn't have to carry all her products around with her.  The disadvantage is that she doesn't of the capital to invest in wholesale products.  \r\n<p>\r\nMaria's dream is to open a sales stall in the market to sell beauty supplies.  She wants to invest in her business by purchasing a stock of wholesale seasonal cosmetics so she can meet her customers' demand and cover her family's expenses.  This is Maria's first loan cycle with the institution in the two years she has been running her business.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria is requesting a loan to purchase wholesale cosmetics so she can sell a greater variety.  With the profits, she wants to open a store in the local market.

Many of the women are involved in the creation of beautiful traditional textiles, as well as animal husbandry. Eight dedicated ladies have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Perlas de Oro\u201d or \u201cGolden Pearls\u201d and are very excited to be receiving their very first loan that they hope will be funded by Kiva investors together with Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nCristina is the lively 37-year-old President of the Trust Bank, and she is married with five children. She takes her responsibilities seriously and has great leadership skills. She is from a family of six children and she is the third daughter. Cristina is the owner of a convenience store and she watches her clientele grow daily. She also sells snacks and raises animals (chickens, pigs and cows). Her goal is to create income and to raise the standard of living of her family. She has requested her first loan that she will use to purchase rice, beans, noodles, oil, sugar, drinking water and gas. These are the items that are most in demand in her store. Cristina is very pleased because the extra income will be really useful for her family, especially now that four of her five children are in school.\r\n\r\nEducation is very important to these women as most have had little or no formal schooling. They are very aware of the value of learning, both for their children and themselves. The \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of Friendship Bridge, that combines small loans and education, is so beneficial for these women. Each month, a Facilitator from the organization shares useful information with the ladies, in their own native language, on everyday topics like budgeting, marketing and sales, as well as nutrition, women\u2019s rights and self-esteem. \r\n\r\nSpeaking on behalf of the women in the \u201cPerlas de Oro\u201d Trust Bank, Cristina expresses her gratitude to Kiva investors for their kindness and generosity in funding their much-needed loans. They are poised to step into a brighter future, benefiting themselves, their families and their community in El Quich\u00e9.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2065.24,"image":{"id":1909819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
