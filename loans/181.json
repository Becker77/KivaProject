With over 4 years of experience in this trade, Sylvia sees an opportunity to expand her enterprise further. Nevertheless, she does not have the working capital necessary to increase her quantity of stock. Thus her loan will be used to buy more gari, sugar, milo, fruit drinks, cooking oil, egg, beans, different kinds of tin fish and tin tomatoes and earthen ware bowl, indirectly helping her boost her overall sales.

It is a busy place and well-known for the fabrication of the traditional, woven wrap around skirts that the women wear called \u201ccortes\u201d.  These textiles are intricately woven in a \u201cjaspe\u201d or \u201cikat\u201d pattern and are often quite colorful and detailed. Local women save their quetzales (the currency in Guatemala) for months or years so that they can buy one.\n\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank called \u201cRayos de Luz\u201d or \u201cRays of Light\u201d was organized by eight women who proudly wear the traditional colorful clothing of the area. One of the younger members of the group is 23 year old Berly, who is married and has two children who are 10 months and 2 years old respectively. Berly completed high school with a teaching certificate. She has a business selling shoes, perfumes and cosmetics sold by catalogue. She also has a small store where she displays and sells these items. Berly is requesting a loan to purchase a new inventory of shoes in a large variety of styles so that she can offer high-quality products to her customers. Berly is well on her way to leaving poverty behind and creating new opportunities for her young family. She feels very content and privileged to be able to have access to a loan with low interest. With her earnings, she is creating a more welcoming atmosphere to her store and has painted the walls. \n\nThe \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of Friendship Bridge, that combines small loans and educational trainings is of great use to Berly and the ladies in the Trust Bank. A Facilitator from Friendship Bridge, using games, role playing, diagrams and pictures, shares lots of knowledge with the women on a variety of subjects. \n\nKIVA investors, partnering with Friendship Bridge, are of great value to Berly and her friends in the \u201cRayos de Luz\u201d Trust Bank. They are well on the path to a more empowered and brighter future, that will not only help themselves but also their families and their community in Totonicapan, Guatemala.

She thanks you for your support.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. Because customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, the women lack tangible collateral assets, and financial institutions do not consider them to be credit-worthy. This leads to poor financial support and, as a result, limited access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. When a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys the equipment from the client, extends a loan to her, and then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a \"sale and leaseback\" arrangement.<\/P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":152092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of cocoa in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-04-23T13:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-07T17:12:11Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-06-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":231131},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-07-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":260209},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-08-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":289026},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-09-07T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":319327},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-10-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-18T07:20:20Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":351365},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347614},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970234},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886484},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:57Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435769},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130074}],"funded_date":"2008-04-23T17:12:11Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":49508,"name":"Thi Thuy Ha","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":"N. thi Thuy Ha (MS: 070030) is twenty six year old.

She has lived in the city of Lima for 20 years. She lives with her 26-year-old son in her own house. For three years, she has sold various products like porcelain decorations, marbles and buttons in a small store she put in her house. She attends to her neighbors, who are her primary customers. Mary really enjoys her work, as it is very laid-back and allows her to generate an income to support herself. But sometimes her work leaves her tired because in the morning she works as a maid in the priests' house next to the parrish, and then works in her own business from 2 o'clock in the afternoon until about 10 at night.

Muidinkhoja is 27 years old. He is in the business of selling DVD disks. He tries to have all the latest movies, concerts of the popular actors, singers and others. He also sells cell phones produced in China. Being the owner of the business, Muidinkhoja  travels to the neighboring country, China, to purchase newer and modern cell phones at wholesale prices. For that reason, the retail prices of his products are lower than his competitors, allowing him to maintain a large clientele in this market. Today, Muidinkhoja is requesting a loan of $2000 USD. He is planning to purchase a large supple of DVD disks and cell phones to increase the quantity and variety of his goods. Muidinkhoja thanks all for supporting him and promises to be diligent in his loan payment.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Vaaipu  has many years of experience in this business.  Vaaipu  needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase additional tailoring equipment such as needles & threads.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 360 tala or US $150 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Vaaipu  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Vaaipu 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vaaipu  N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.78 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.88 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Her routine starts with the milking of her cows and then the process of separation to produce the milk that she sells.

He enjoys his work because he knows how to get a good harvest. Although it can be tedious, it is satisfying to him because he enjoys this rural way of life. At harvest time, Apolonio and his family must work twice as hard, because it takes a great deal of effort to harvest all the potatoes. He then sells these to wholesalers in the city who offer him a steady income, allowing him to live comfortably. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Apolonio would like to increase production and start to plant peas, because the price of peas has been stable on the national level, This is his third loan with MFP [the Kiva field partner] and he promises to be on time with his repayments. He also reports that he enjoys working with his communal bank group because all of the members are responsible and on-time in their payments. Apolonio plans to use this loan to buy fertilizers and pesticides to protect his crops. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":533575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizer and pesticides for his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-07T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Apolonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2010.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886386}],"funded_date":"2010-05-22T18:40:29Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

She\u2019s a resident of a small Southern town: Kadamjai. Since early childhood, Gulbar watched her parents raise cattle. They later realized that they had to pass on the family business to Gulbar. Gulbar\u2019s parents have been breeding cattle for years and distributing their product to many local buyers. The business was started with only 500 soms, and eighteen years ago Gulbar took charge of it. Small investments brought some profit. At the moment she has two dairy cows and two young calves. She keeps herself busy every day. \r\n\r\nGulbar is married; her husband is an expert in a local firm. He also tries to help Gulbar with business. They thank their lucky stars for succeeding in this business because it helped them to provide a good education for their children. Their oldest son works in the US; their second son makes a living in Turkey. Unfortunately, the youngest son has physical disabilities and stays at home with his parents. \r\n\r\nEighteen years of cattle breeding generated proceeds to arrange a nice wedding ceremony for their daughter. Now they are working on the construction of their own filling station. Cattle breeding brings only 3000 soms a month, which is not enough for purchasing the required construction materials. The family hopes to get this loan to finish construction of the gas station. Traffic is always busy in their town, so they are sure that the filling station will always be full of customers and that they will be able to repay the loan. \r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? --- \r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She works at the business for nine hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by her husband. Maida currently earns about 150 USD from her business.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in the house that she inherited from her parents and hopes to be able to get ahead with her work. Her craft stand is located in the San Jos\u00e9 market (an important market in the city of Juliaca), which is very busy due to the attractive and original models that she weaves. She always receives her clients, who are primarily tourists, with a smile and she very happily shows them the crafts that she sells. What she likes most about her work is to weave as since she was a young girl she has had a lot of passion for this art.  She has been doing this work for 5 years and the most difficult part is to transport her crafts from her workshop to her stand as there are many bundles that she brings. In the future she hopes to have a larger store where she can sell her items with greater ease.  This is Mery's second loan with MFP and like she did with her first loan she is prepared to make all of her payments on time. In her communal bank she is very responsible as she is always up to date on the agreements at which the group arrives. With the 1000 soles she will buy more wool to increase the quantity of items that she weaves and increase her stand's stock.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Aimee Sostowski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":315642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To purchase wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-07T20:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596210},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:41Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990488},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211599},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:56Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641120},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080560},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":172.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996685}],"funded_date":"2009-05-07T21:43:04Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aimee Sostowski","image":null}},{"id":110983,"name":"Rosalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalie C. has 1-hectare rice farm.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Jaime has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. He is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase more livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be his seventh loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Hermelinda Gilberta O. T. is the leader of the group.  She is 25, and she sells fruits and soft drinks in the afternoons.  She takes this opportunity to sell roasted corn on the cob.  She started her business with help from her sister 12 years ago.  She sold fruit in the offices close to where her sister was selling.  The fruit that she sold was provided by her sister.  \r\n\r\nShe was earning money, and she managed to buy her own fruit.  She also sold sweets.  Three years later she was able to have her own small stand on 35th Street Galerias del Sur in zone 11 in the capital.  From there she was able to have a business stocked with sweets and fruits.  Her biggest wish is to be able to excel in her small business and stock it with imported fruits.\r\n\r\nHilda T., another member of the group, has had a tortilla business in her house for eight years.  Her family is comprised of five minor children.  Her dream for her business is to be able to have another type of sales like firewood and beans to offer her customers.\r\n\r\nThe other member of the group, Ana Rosalia T. T., has been selling tortillas for five years.  Her business is in her house.  She has three minor children.  Her biggest wish for her business is to hire another person to help her.  She wants to do this in order to take care of the demand that she has in her business.\r\n\r\nThese women are requesting this loan because they have many plans and dreams for their lives.  Therefore, they need the capital to work in their businesses. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":599226,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro Sacatep\u00e8quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2010-09-13T16:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda Candelaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermelinda Gilberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Rosaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000.08},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":999.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.01},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125.01,"local_amount":1000.08,"processed_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396346},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534901},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189137554},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414983},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195833576},{"amount":124.99,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201276106},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-17T07:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206397888},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211216325},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216494696}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T00:32:40Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":234747,"name":"Catherine Sempeyo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Catherine Sempeyo K. is 22 years old and a widow who supports two members of her family.

She is married with two children. At the moment, one has completed senior high school. She has been a local manufacturer of palm oil and palm kernel oil for eight years now. Palm oil is produced from palm nut fruits and the palm kernel is a by-product of palm oil, which is produced first. The palm kernel is processed through various stages to obtain the palm kernel oil.  Palm kernel is used to prepare many local dishes.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>Her production is on a small scale because she has inadequate capital to buy machines for the processing. She wants to use this loan to buy more palm nuts to increase her efficiency to produce in larger quantities.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the money that she is currently requesting she will buy kitchen utensils; also she will invest in the carpentry shop, buying a larger amount of wood to make the furniture that has been ordered recently.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":385432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy kitchen utensils for her take out food business and wood for her husband's carpentry shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-09T01:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":262.4},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":265.99},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":275.03},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":287.62},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":299.13},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":309.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.61},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.88},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.07},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.51},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.58},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":92.61,"local_amount":262.4,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":271.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081321},{"amount":93.88,"local_amount":265.99,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":275.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997481},{"amount":97.07,"local_amount":275.03,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":284.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842827},{"amount":316.44,"local_amount":896.58,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":927.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734406}],"funded_date":"2009-09-09T02:47:15Z","paid_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":139727,"name":"Vilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vilma is engaged in hog raising business.

She was able to establish the cafe several years ago, and she makes a variety of food for it.  This has helped her husband to cover the basic expenses.  He is a taxi driver, and there are days when he has few customers.\r\n\r\nThat is why she took the initiative to work in order to get income.  Through the years she has been improving her house.  She has done that with the help of a loan through the institution.  It is the only way to be able to build because everything is expensive.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to build a room for privacy and to be more comfortable.  Her house is small.  She will buy stone, ten zinc sheets, ten bags of cement, iron, buttresses, and other things to start the work.\r\n\r\nHer plans are to keep working and to achieve economic equilibrium to cover her payments. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":575159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Build a room for privacy and to be more comfortable -

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She joined One Acre Fund in order to access fertilizer and hybrid seeds and ensure food security for her family. In the recent 2011 season, Joan had an excellent maize yield harvesting 16 bags on 1 acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Joan was only able to harvest 8 bags of maize on 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Joan and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and

Peter is from Ivano-Frankivsk.  Since childhood, he has had \"golden hands\" and was able to make anything from wood.  At another time, Peter worked as a driver, expediter at a spirits plant.  Then, after taking his friend's advise, he started his own business.  Peter has been involved in making furniture out of chipboard to-order for seven years.  He always has work orders due to having loyal customers and producing quality work.  Currently, his monthly income is 5,000 hryvnia.  Peter has one hired worker.  Having a means of transportation (a 1999 Gazel passenger van) also helps a lot in the business.  Peter plans to invest a loan in the sum of 8,000 hryvnia into a purchase of necessary materials for making furniture, specifically purchasing chipboard and furniture accessories.  In the near future, Peter hopes to buy a new passenger, so that it is easier for him to meet with clients.  Peter loves his family very much and invests a lot into the well-being of his relatives.  One of the interesting facts could be that recently Peter's daughter won a prize at a world championship in track and field (200 meter run and a 4x100 meter relay)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":900479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"purchase necessary materials for making furniture, specifically purchasing chipboard and furniture accessories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Ivano-Frankivsk","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"48.884167 24.686111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2011-10-21T05:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":674}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":85.33,"local_amount":666,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":682.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244597107},{"amount":85.33,"local_amount":666,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":682.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250811094},{"amount":85.33,"local_amount":666,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:45:47Z","rounded_local_amount":682.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257219818},{"amount":85.34,"local_amount":666,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":682.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263357856},{"amount":85.33,"local_amount":666,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":682.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270071186},{"amount":85.33,"local_amount":666,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-18T08:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":682.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277255169},{"amount":85.33,"local_amount":666,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-19T08:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":682.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283717594},{"amount":427.68,"local_amount":3338,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-20T08:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3418.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287518561}],"funded_date":"2011-10-24T01:01:37Z","paid_date":"2012-07-20T08:01:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":353640,"name":"Euphrasie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Euphrasie is 57 years old and is married with four children between the ages of 12 and 31.

Q., 31, sells new clothes by either walking in the streets or going house to house knocking on doors. She goes to Guatemala City or as they call it here \u201cGuate\u201d to buy new clothes to sell. With this loan she will be able to restock her selection, which is very low because she has sold out of everything. The first loan was so successful in starting her new business that she's pleased to be moving on to a second loan.<p>She and the other members of her group just finished paying off their first 6 month loan. They all paid up in full and on time, something to be proud of and not something all groups are able to achieve. <p>She is married and has two children, both in school. When asked how much schooling she has had she was shy to admit that she had only finished the sixth grade. But she knows how important school is. Her dream is to continue with her own schooling to become a nurse and help her husband finish schooling as an electronics repairman in radios and televisions. Her health and her family's health are not particularly robust.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

We have never benefited from a loan before Kiva\u2019s arrival.  With the first loan, we purchased maintenance and cleaning products (bleach, brooms, detergents, etc\u2026.) at low prices that we brought to the marketplace and have even worked with other women\u2019s associations for the right distribution of these products.  Sales have been good.  This enables us to collect some profit, allowing us to make our payments on time, per the loan contract, and even to make them ahead of time.  Thanks to this initial loan, we have been able to cope with numerous social and family-related problems.

She tells us that she's very happy because she feels like business is good and now that she is ahead everything will be much better. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":335683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy ground beef, pork, and chicken, tomato salsas, cabbage tortillas, butter, oil, salt, cheese, and soft drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Lorenzo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.416667 -87.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2009-06-13T21:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":768.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63229933},{"amount":40.61,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":768.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73661511},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T01:45:12Z","rounded_local_amount":768.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87101541},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T05:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":768.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97018564},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":768.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103863212},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:28:43Z","rounded_local_amount":768.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110752903},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":768.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118141977},{"amount":40.66,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":768.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123979426}],"funded_date":"2009-06-14T17:39:02Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:09:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Bishop","image":107465}},{"id":119207,"name":"Lino","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lino T., 47, is married with four children.

His strategy has been to buy undernourished looking cows at low costs and then to feed them hearty diets and provide them with proper care, so that they then may regain full health and be sold at higher prices.  Benon would like to use the loan to buy more medicine for his cattle, so he may further improve their health. He believes that his productivity and hard working nature will give him an edge against competitors and allow him to eventually scale his business so that he may begin selling his cattle in large quantities at local town centers.

The members of group Djekadi intend to make a monthly profit of 10 000FCFA to 15 000FCFA each which will be used for the repayment of interest on the loan and the daily expenses of the family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Cletus Kuunifaa, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":415140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":" Purchase of various items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:53Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raki               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":18376.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873772},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":18376.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763498},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":18376.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152313},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:43Z","rounded_local_amount":18376.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991167},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":18376.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021435},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":16666.65,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:09Z","rounded_local_amount":18376.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746237}],"funded_date":"2009-11-01T18:39:47Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cletus Kuunifaa","image":306418}},{"id":152122,"name":"Firuza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

However, both continue to pursue their dream of helping their children economically.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP, and she is sure that she will make her payments on time.  She will invest the funds she is requesting into the purchase of fertilizer, to ensure that her farmland is healthy and continues to yield bountiful crops in the future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":444391,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Oxapampa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10.333333 -75.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-08T22:20:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":334.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734898},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":334.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124222},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":334.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959962},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":334.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992808},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":334.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717597},{"amount":117.25,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":336.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751272}],"funded_date":"2009-12-10T18:47:08Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":164541,"name":"Mario Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Marlon  tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad, casado, con tres hermosos hijos menores de edad, su negocio es la venta de CD, en pel\u00edculas, videos, m\u00fasica, el cual lleva once a\u00f1os es las ventas, vende ambulante, anteriormente vend\u00eda le\u00f1a, carb\u00f3n, pero se ha dedicado solo a la venta de cd, todo esto lo logro con los pr\u00e9stamo de la instituci\u00f3n pues comenz\u00f3 con poco y luego con la inversi\u00f3n aumento las ventas, con el con el financiamiento,  anterior logro aumentar su inventario, este cr\u00e9dito lo esta solicitando para compara parte de pel\u00edculas y materiales de construcci\u00f3n para repellar las paredes de su casa el cual comprara: arena y cemento para hacer la obra el cual esta contento por poder hacer una mejora en su casa, como en su negocio el cual espera poder tener alg\u00fan d\u00eda un lugar fijo\n\n","en":"Marlon is 36 years and married with three beautiful young children.

The group consists of eight members.  This Communal Association is led by its Board of Directors.  At the head of the Board is the President, Sra. Daysi.  The members of the Communal Association engage in various businesses so that they can get ahead.  These incluD. making dinnerware to use as gifts, sewing garments, selling sausages and potatoes from a kiosk, selling American brands of clothing, selling quilts, selling vegetables, and making clothing for pets.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Daysi, the President of the Communal Association, said that she has been a member of \u201cAngoritas\u201d for approximately a year and a half and has participated in three loan cycles.  During this time, she has managed a business selling hamburgers and \u201csalchipapas\u201d (sausages and fried potatoes).  Sra. Daysi did not have a business before.  She used her first loan to buy supplies she needed to start her business such as bread, potatoes, oil, sausages, meat, and paper sacks.  The loan for this cycle will be used to buy supplies in bulk, thus allowing her to save some money.  Whenever the ladies purchase in bulk, the unit cost per item is less.  \r\n<p>\r\nDaysi conducts her sales from a kiosk she borrowed from her aunt.  Her business is open on Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.  By working to this schedule, she is able to take care of her five children.  Her greatest challenge is leaving them alone since her husband is deceased.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Daysi said she enjoys the opportunity to receive a loan with a group guarantee since she currently has no other type of guarantee.  In addition, she has been treated well by the staff and is excited about continuing ahead.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe photo shows nine adults because the mother of one of the members (the woman in the front row who is knitting) was present at this meeting.

She is is 42 years old and married with a 6-year-old son who has not started his education yet. Her husband is a rickshaw driver providing transport services to passengers. He has been operating his transport business for the past 16 years. As a result, his rickshaw has grown old and on time maintenance is required.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, Khalida has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner Asasah for her husband who will replace his rickshaw body with a new one and also do some repair work so it performs better.

She likes to sell a little bit of everything and started the easiest way selling shoes which helped her trust her neighbors more and figure out if they were responsible.  \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan she got to stock up on tennis shoes and shoes for the Christmas season because this is what people need the most around this time and this way she can help her husband with household expenses and their children\u2019s schooling costs.\r\n\r\nOne of Marcela\u2019s most wished-for dreams is to continue growing in business to keep her good customers so that she can continue to sell them natural products to lose weight in the long run but being associated directly with the firm.\r\n\r\nThe group shared an anecdote about one of the members.  They mention that when she started to form her groups her husband would scold her and prohibit her from taking part in this but as time went by she was able to show her husband that she could take care of her payments and of her business all by herself and didn\u2019t need to depend on him.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

They called their group \"Tamemgbo,\" a Temne word for \u201clet\u2019s keep trying.\u201d They have received several loans from Kiva through SMT. They have repaid the previous loans successfully. Their previous loan was for Le 800,000 each. That loan helped them a lot. They were able to make a lot of profit from the loan and solve many of their problems. Today, they are requesting a new loan for Le 1,000,000 each to add to their businesses.\r\n\r\nAbdul (right) is the leader of this group. Abdul was born in Makeni in northern Sierra Leone. He is forty-five years of age, a husband with four children: two in secondary school, one in primary school. The youngest is not of school age yet. Together, he and his wife sell second-hand bed sheets. He has been a businessman for over fifteen years.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of Le 1,000,000, Abdul will buy about five bales of second-hand bed sheets to add to his business. He travels to Freetown, a distance of 390 miles round trip, to buy the bed sheets. A bale of second-hand bed sheets costs between Le 220,000 and Le 250,000. The fare to and from Freetown is Le 30,000 and a single bale will cost him Le 3,000 to transport back to Makeni.   \r\n\r\nThe only challenge Abdul is facing in his business is that of occasional slow sales. The people of Makeni struggle to generate the discretionary income necessary to purchase fresh bed sheets from Abdul. Also, a challenging rain or dry season can also impede sales. Apart from this, business is going well for him and he loves doing it.

Lidia raises livestock to sell in Zepita's markets and also, sells cleaning products and toiletries (toothpaste, shoe polish, brushes etc.). Her first loan was of 500 soles, which she used to buy young livestock, raising them and eventually, selling them. Now, she is requesting a loan of 1,500. soles, which she will repay in 3 installments, so that she can buy some bulls to raise for the market, either in Zepita or in Huacullani. Also, she would like to continue to improve her second business, her trade in cleaning products and toiletries. Lidia dreams of buying her own house in Desaguadero, even though many people - including her parents - are renters.

She tells us that when she arrived to live at her house, it was very modest, and well, it was of rustic materials like a thatch roof. Little by little, she improved and raised it, thanks the strength of her and her husband. Now she owns a grocery store and also a small stand to pattern clothing, where she spends a lot of time working, as it's a job that requires a lot of dedication. What Mirta has to do is to receive textile fabrics, and stamps them with patterns and different border figures, making them more attractive so they can be sold more rapidly. She likes her job very much, as while as the opportunity to use her creativity.

He lives in his own home with his youngest son who helps him in the small farm.  For some 40 years, Filem\u00f3n gets up very early every morning and goes to work on his small farm.  He knows that he needs to put all of his efforts in making his land more fertile so that he can have a good harvest.  His products are sold in the city of Pichanaki, where he has a lot of buyers because of the quality of his crops.  What he enjoys most in his work is to sow his land and he does this carefully he also fumigates his land which is very dangerous, but he needs to do it to prevent plagues so that they don\u2019t affect his crop production.  With time, he hopes to rent more land to increase production.

William is always busy, organizing his day so that in the morning he wakes up early, eats breakfast and then feeds his chickens and pigs. He then switches gears, taking on the work in the fields.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Habanero chili peppers. Specifically, William will use this money to purchase seeds, fertilizer, tools, pesticides, and other materials\/ingredients necessary to the production of chili peppers. All labour and transportation tasks will be carried out by William and his family.\r\n\r\nWilliam dedicates part of his time as a hired hand on a nearby farm. He worries about the coming harvesting season and hopes that he will be successful this year. William\u2019s goals are to maintain stability in his family, achieve higher production rates, improve his economic situation, and offer a better standard of living to his family.\r\n\r\nA major difficulty and limitation for William has been his lack of working capital. He hopes to use this loan effectively to improve life on his farm for everyone.\r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Los Chiles, thus ensuring that their products will reach market.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to William, his family and his community. By offering a source of start-up capital, and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, William wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented; he wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his neighborhood.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":575225,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase seeds and nutrients necessary for the production of chili peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Los Chiles","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-07-27T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95914.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97513.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99138.68},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100790.99},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102470.84},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104171.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.97},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.39},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":606300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191428382}],"funded_date":"2010-07-28T04:35:41Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:42:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":222503,"name":"Luna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luna C. is from the village of Lunao, Gingoog City.

All of them live in the city of Temuco.\r\nMar\u00eda is a member of the communal bank.  In the photo, she is in the back row, third from the right.  She is wearing a light-green jacket and a lilac scarf.  She has made her living in handicrafts for the last 7 years.  Among the items she crafts are dolls.  She spends time each day taking care of the housework, which is generally in the mornings.  And then she sets her afternoons aside to make her handicrafts.  She says that she enjoys her trade and that her mother did the same. \r\nMar\u00eda offers her products for sale in the various artisan fairs. \r\nShe purchases her materials every 3 weeks in different stores around the city of Temuco. \r\nWith the loan, she will purchase a sewing machine, which will help her to increase her production.  Currently, she does all the sewing by hand.\r\nHer goal is to increase production of her handicrafts. \r\nMar\u00eda says that during the Christmas season and summer vacation, her sales will increase considerably due to the demand for products in the artisan fairs that she participates in. \r\nMar\u00eda lives together with her husband and three children, who are 19, 18 and 8 years old.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education
