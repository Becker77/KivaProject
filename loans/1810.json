She is single and has an 11 year old son. Her business is making sheets. She is a good mother who is enterprising, dedicated to her work, loyal, responsible and very hardworking. She runs her business in the \u2018Plan 3000\u2019 area where the victims of a river flood have made their homes. It is 12 kilometers from the town center. The residents arrived from the provinces and other parts of the country and established this area, which today has 20% of the total population. It is the poorest district. It has a warm, sub-tropical climate with a temperature that varies between 21-35 degrees celsius.  \r\n\r\nMaria has dark skin, brown eyes, long, black hair that reaches her shoulders, short stature, and a robust build. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks at home, and she speaks Spanish in the general culture and for her business. She is seated on the right, wearing a yellow t-shirt. She lives her life with her son, who is in school. They live in a home of their own built from wood with a metal sheeting roof and a brick floor. It has potable water, electricity, and plumbing. Her desire to get ahead drove her to lead a bank of people with businesses such as: selling nutritional products, selling natural juices, a bread bakery, selling second hand clothes, selling cell phone cases, selling coca leaves and selling ice cream. This was to ask for a loan and improve their activities. Her business is making sheets. She buys fabric wholesale with designs, textures and of different qualities to make sheets in al sizes such as twin, full, queen and king. \u201cA set of sheets is generally made up of three pieces: fitted, flat sheet and pillowcases,\" she remarks. The advantage of her business is that due to the warm climate people just use sheets as their bedding and this leads to good sales. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy fabric to use. Her dream is to open a permanent sales stall for the bedding. She wants to buy fabric wholesale to make the sheets. This is her first loan cycle with the institution during the 3 years she has been doing this activity. \r\n\r\nThese are the reasons why Maria is asking for a loan to buy fabric wholesale to make sheets and open a sales stall for bedding. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":1902984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric wholesale to make sheets and open a stall to sell bedding.

She is a mother of twelve children; only three of them are in school. The sources of her income are from cassava growing, rice farming, and occasionally from wage work. For the past 12 years, she has earned about 13,000 KHR per day. Lack of working capital to support her business is her main challenge. She has had four loans through VisionFund, and she has completely repaid these loans. She is now leading a group of two members to apply for another loan.

La ventaja de su negocio es que los fines de semana cuenta con ventas constantes, la desventaja es la falta de capital para abastecer con mayor variedad y cantidad su negocio. Su sue\u00f1o es ser distribuidora mayorista, ella desea realizar la compra de variedad de licores para abastecer su negocio y pagar los gastos de manutenci\u00f3n de su hijo.

Her business is selling liquor.  She is a good mother.  She is enterprising, independent, tenacious, responsible, and very hard-working.  She conducts her business on the road to Villa Adela.  It is an area known for uniting several areas through public transportation networks.  From this place you can get transportation to areas outside the city.  It has a cold and dry climate with temperatures that varies during the day between 0 to 12 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nAlsion has a dark complexion, brown eyes, and long hair that is dyed a reddish color.  She is short and has a strong build.  Her mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks where she lives.  She speaks Spanish with the general public and for her business.  She shares her life with her son, who goes to school.  She lives in a family house, which is built of brick and cement and has a corrugated tin roof and a wood floor.  She has running water, electricity, gas, and indoor plumbing.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling liquors like \u2018singani\u2019 (made from white grapes), rum, whiskey, beer, and vodka, etc.  She conducts her business in her store, which is in the bottom part of her house.  Her schedule is during the day and on the week-ends until dawn.  \u201cI started my business as a helper in another liquor business.  With the help of my ex-life partner, I managed to accumulate some capital with which I now support my son,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that on the week-ends she has steady sales.  The disadvantage is the lack of capital to stock a greater variety and quantity for her business.  Her dream is to be a wholesale distributor.  \r\n\r\nShe wishes to buy a variety of liquors to stock her business and to pay her son\u2019s living expenses.  This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 15 years she has been engaged in this business activity.\r\n\r\nThat is why Alison is requesting a loan to buy liquors to stock her store and to pay the expenses of feeding her son. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1903005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy liquors to stock her store and to pay the expenses of feeding her son.

So far, he has been able to create six job opportunities through his business ventures.\r\n\r\nBenard has lived in Nairobi\u2019s Kiambiu area for five years and is a witness to poor and lack of sanitation facilities. At the entertainment joint he owns for instance exists a poorly maintained urinal that exhibits an awful stench chasing away his customers. In addition, entrepreneurs and residents in that area cannot easily access toilets hence numerous flying toilets are openly disposed.\r\n\r\nHis friend Boniface runs two Fresh Life Toilets and was the one who introduced him to this toilet option. Benard whose next project was the establishment of commercial toilet facilities was thrilled that he had found a solution to his predicament. He now wants to establish two Fresh Life Toilets, one to serve customers and staff at his joint while the other targets residents and entrepreneurs of Kiambiu area.\r\n\r\nBenard is optimistic that with the establishment of toilet facilities for his community, he will contribute towards cleaning his immediate environment from flying toilets and will further create the much needed employment opportunity for more young people. He hopes to hire an attendant who will ensure compliance and good maintenance of the Fresh Life Toilets.\r\n\r\nLet us join in and help Benard in providing hygienic and accessible toilet facilities to

This is her story.\r\n\r\nWhat do you study at the Maharishi Institute? Which classes do you enjoy most?\r\nAnna: I am studying for a Bachelor of Business Arts degree at Maharishi Institute. I enjoy Transcendental Meditation, which has to do with my inner self and consciousness. Business courses that I like are Human Resources Management and Financial Management. They are the courses that I enjoy the most.\r\n\r\nWhat are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? Please be specific: In which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\nAnna: My goal is to become a successful business woman, as I will have the qualifications that will help me to start my own business or to work in a business company. I would like to work in a top management department in the business sector. Durban, Johannesburg, and Cape Town are all cities I would like to work in and travel to.\r\n\r\nTell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children?\r\nAnna: I was born and raised in Maseru, Lesotho by two married parents. I have two siblings (two sisters) and no children. I am planning to have children when I am done at Maharishi Institute, financially stable, and married. My father was working in the mines before he passed away in 2003. As for my mother, she has never worked or had a stable job; she only had piece jobs here and there.\r\n\r\nWhat do you like to do in your spare time?\r\nAnna: I like learning new things, reading motivational books, and spending my spare time hanging out with friends and family.\r\n\r\nHow will Kiva change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: will there be significant changes?\r\nAnna: A Kiva loan will change my life for the better, as I will not struggle with expenses for transportation to school. I will concentrate more in my studies, knowing that I get help somewhere. That will also help me a lot with my rent.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":16.6,"image":{"id":1910520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is her story:\r\n\r\nWhat do you study at the Maharishi Institute? Which classes do you enjoy most?\r\nI am studying for a Bachelor of Business Arts. I enjoy meditating or consciousness classes. Math is the most enjoyable subject for me.\r\n\r\nWhat are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? Please be specific: In which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\nMy goal is to start my own business, since I will have the qualifications to do so (and the experience to do so). I want to work in the construction industry and be in a top management position. I would like to work in Durban. Yes, I would like to travel overseas.\r\n\r\nTell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children?\r\nI was born in Swaziland, and I have five brothers and five sisters. My parents are both unemployed. My dad was in an accident in 2012, and he had to leave work and go back to Swaziland. My mother has never worked in her life. I do not have children. I plan to have children after finishing my degree, when I am financially stable in life.\r\n\r\nWhat do you like to do in your spare time?\r\nI like to read motivational books and to listen to music. I also visit my friends, and we study or do homework.\r\n\r\nHow will Kiva change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: will there be significant changes?\r\nKiva's loan can change my life, since I spend money on rent, transportation, and food. Since my parents are unemployed, I will be able to support myself through the loan and will be relieved from the stress of not being able to afford school.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":16.6,"image":{"id":1910533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She is married but does not have children. She is independent; she doesn\u2019t let herself be ordered. She is a person who has always shown this independence and this character to continue on her path. \n\nIn 2008, she started a grocery store business, which she takes care of 12 hours per day. This business is allowing her to support her household, help her mother, and allocate a small amount of her earnings to save up for buying her own house.

Ni Ketut, 30, is group leader and has three children, including a newborn. As a housewife, she\u2019s very responsible for her family and also the group she leads. The group raises pigs for six months and then sells to a buyer.They earned a satisfactory profit because the price for pork and demand were high. Ni Ketut's earnings fulfill her family's needs and she also sets aside some money for savings.\r\nAlthough the group earned a satisfactory profit,Tegal Sari is proposing a new loan. Now, they are asking for a smaller loan because some of the group used their own money as capital for the pig business. The group's loan amount is 6.000.000 IDR.

She is married and has two sons. The family lives in Mai Son district, Son La province. She is also the leader of this group of borrowers.\r\n<p>\r\nBoth Khap and her husband are civil servants. Because both of her sons are school aged, she has to watch money very closely in order to pay her sons\u2019 tuition and have enough money to cover the family\u2019s living expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nTo increase her income Khap wants to raise chickens and pigs, but she hasn\u2019t the capital to invest in this venture. She wants now to borrow 70,000,000 VND through Kiva's field partner M7-MFI for her group, and she will use her portion to start her business.\r\n<p>\r\nKhap believes that this loan will help her raise her livestock especially well, which should lead to considerably good profits next year.

Zuvaidahan has a secondary education. She knows how to use and plan her funds correctly in order to achieve her goals. She rears animals and grows crops as the main source of income for her family. Having started with the purchase of livestock for 8,000 som (KGS), thanks to Zuvaidahan's hard work today she has three cows and a horse. She has all the conditions for keeping livestock: a barn and pasture land. She grows potatoes and corn on a 1.64 plot of land. Zuvaidahan has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) to buy six sheep and corn for livestock feed.

sphagnum moss, an organic product that is highly demanded by international orchid growers for its moisture retention and disease resistance effects.

With the loan the company plans to install seven drying beds, improve management of the land, cover the costs of needed licenses, and ensure the quality of the moss continues to meet high export standards. \n\nInka Moss is the only company in Peru that involves remote communities in its supply chain in the collection and processing of the moss. Inka Moss buys the moss from the communities and sells it on the international market. To date, it has provided a dignified and sustainable income to more than 1,500 small farmers from 15 communities that were extremely poor. Inka Moss has also developed partnerships with the local forestry authorities and pays for a license to operate with a site management plan that takes into account ecological sustainability and land regeneration needs. \n\nTo help the local producers improve the quality of their moss, Inka Moss developed an innovative on site drying bed that allows them to produce drier moss and reduce waste collection. Inka Moss received support to pilot test this new drying bed in two communities from NESsT, an organization that since 1997, has invested financing and business expertise to develop social enterprises that bring innovative solutions to alleviate poverty in emerging market countries. With these new beds, the farmers increased their yield by 15% and helped improve their production efficiency. \n\nYour support of this loan will help Inka Moss expand its reach and provide people in these remote Andean communities with a way out of poverty through a dignified and reliable source of income. Over the next five years, the company expects to reach 45,000 people in 30 communities in the high Andes."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":49925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1912903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Her husband has been running a small general store for five years; he offers all kinds of goods related to book depot, tailoring and cosmetics. His shop is situated in a populated area and lots of customers are available here to offer miscellaneous items to; this is the reason he keeps all kind of goods in stock. He tries to offer all those products which are necessary and consumable every day. Now he wants to offer additional bakery items such as bread, jam, milk, cookies, butter, sandwiches, patties, etc. But the major problem is his lack of funds.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Rafia has requested a loan from Kvia\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband would be able to buy additional bakery items such as bread, jam, milk, cookies, butter, sandwiches, patties, etc. He is very glad after utilizing this loan and hopeful that he will be successful in fulfilling each request for any item and not disappoint his customers. In this way he will be able to generate maximum profit from the sale of additional bakery items and can cherish his children in a better way. Rafia is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

Pablo's income depends on coffee which he produces according to different certifications and sells through COCAFCAL as a member. <br \/><br \/>Pablo has decided to change his production to 100% organic so the best option is to plant his plantation anew. Pablo's dream is to present his children with a good example of how to work the earth with respect for it's purity. So it is for this reason that he says that nothing will stop him from converting to organic. <br \/><br \/>He wants to convert 1 hectare to organic production and besides protecting the biodiversity he can access better markets and prices for his coffee. A loan will help Pablo to buy all that is necessary to convert to organic such as : coffee plants, organic fertilizers, insecticides and organic fungicides. The organic coffee production will allow him to obtain higher profit for his coffee and improve his family's quality of living."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1903162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy organic manure, pesticides, insecticides, coffee plants and pay for labor needed to convert to organic production on his coffee plantation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Capucas, San Pedro Cop\u00e1n, Honduras","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":448,"posted_date":"2015-06-23T22:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-23T22:30:04Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":73,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2018-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":7895},{"due_date":"2019-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":9158.2},{"due_date":"2020-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":10623.51},{"due_date":"2021-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12323.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":360.21},{"due_date":"2019-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":417.84},{"due_date":"2020-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":484.7},{"due_date":"2021-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-06-27T10:51:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":905625,"name":"Nazia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nazia is a 43-year-old married woman living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan with her family.

For that reason, she strives day-by-day to reach her goals. She is 51 years old and lives with her four children in a community of Solol\u00e1. Juana likes dealing with people, so 10 years ago she decided to look for a job where she could gain some money and from that point on she has worked tending her little corn mill. Thanks to this service that she gives to the women in her community, they do not suffer as much when they need to mill their corn. With the little earnings that she gets with her mill, she supports her children with the school expenses. \r\n\r\nUpon seeing the great benefit that her corn mill gives her and her neighbors, Juana sees the necessity to now buy a disc grinder to continue to grind the best dough that the women then use to prepare delicious tortillas. One of the difficulties that Juana has is not having money. So now, with a group of women, she is asking for a loan to be able to purchase her grinder. Juana's big dream is to be able to buy another mill to better lend her services to people. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":242.05,"image":{"id":1903186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy a disc grinder for a corn mill.
