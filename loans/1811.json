has to be very patient in managing trucking services especially in a country like the Philippines where traffic is quite congested, some of the drivers are not very disciplined, and local authorities have little concern whatsoever. \r\n\r\nSome months ago, local authorities of Manila enforced a longer truck ban in the city where trucks are not allowed on the roads of Manila during certain times of day and night. It resulted to slow distribution of products and the infamous port congestion in the port of Manila. Consequently, prices of products went high and trucking services had experienced huge loss. Just recently, Manila authorities gave in to public clamor and realized that they were slowing down the economy affecting all stakeholders, the producers, the distributors, and most especially the consumers. \r\n\r\nLudivina, from Caloocan City, was one of those truck operators who had this crisis. She and her husband, Jimmy, a truck driver, long to regain their deficit now that trucking operations are back to normal. Ludivina needs additional capital of PHP 16,000 to buy spare parts for the truck and pay for its repair. This loan will ensure the continuous operation of her business, paving the way to a more stable income.

One of her children got a serious illness and her whole family exerted all efforts for his recovery. Same is true when it comes to her variety store and RTW [ready-to-wear clothing] business. The income from her business goes up and down, nevertheless, all members of her family contribute what they can in order to sustain their needs. Her husband Rowell is a taxi driver, and he takes turns looking after the store when he is not on driving duty. Their children also do the same during their vacant hours after school. <br \/><br \/>However, the family's effort is not enough to earn adequately and sustain their increasing expenses, especially during emergencies. What Evelyn needs is additional capital of PhP 15,000 to buy more RTW products and supplies for her variety store. She can gain more profit from this loan which will lead to her family's improved way of life. <br \/><br \/>Evelyn dreams of a successful life and career for her children after they finish their college education.

This will also improve her well-being and that of her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":149.98,"image":{"id":1903212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy products for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"TIERRA ALTA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2015-06-24T04:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-24T04:10:05Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Amparo Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.4,"local_amount":144122,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-21T12:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":145755.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.25,"payment_id":697633403},{"amount":27.55,"local_amount":74939,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:45:05Z","rounded_local_amount":75788.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.43,"payment_id":711502745},{"amount":29.5,"local_amount":77008,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:21:52Z","rounded_local_amount":77880.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.3,"payment_id":731020360},{"amount":28.53,"local_amount":78879,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":79773.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.02,"payment_id":752108521}],"funded_date":"2015-07-23T14:45:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":905781,"name":"Nham","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nham is a hardworking woman and is 32 years old.

hardworking people and they have never avoided the difficulties that are part of the agricultural business. Anna's husband is a migrant worker, and she currently lives with her mother-in-law and three children (20-year-old daughter, 16-year-old and 11-years old son). On the farm, the family keeps four cows, two pigs, seven calves and eight chickens.  They also cultivate wheat and potatoes. Anna now decided to purchase more cattle and develop her farm. For that reason, she asks for a loan from Kiva and hopes that this new loan will be successful for her.\r\n \r\nBecause the region where their village is located is considered poor, and the unemployment rate here is very high, people face numerous difficulties in developing their businesses. Anna's loan has been approved within the joint initiative between SEF and Kiva, which provides loans to the under-served population of the Shirak region, to help them to access the market and earn a living. Anna hopes to receive lenders' support and enlarge her agribusiness, so her husband will be able to come back to his family.

At first, it was very difficult for Zohrak to maintain his farming work without his father's support, but due to his and his wife's hard work, they are now able to successfully run the farm. \r\n\r\nZohrak is mostly involved in land cultivation (he grows wheat, potatoes, cherries, walnuts and apples). He takes the gathered harvest to the local market and sells it. \r\n\r\nZohrak decided to purchase potato seeds and fertilizer. This will enable him to prepare his farm for cultivation works and have a harvest in the winter. \r\n\r\nBecause the region where Zohrak's village is located is considered poor, and the unemployment rate here is very high, people face numerous difficulties in developing their businesses. Zohrak's loan has been approved within the joint initiative between SEF and Kiva, which provides loans to the under-served population of the Shirak region, to help them to access the market and earn a living. \r\n\r\nZohrak hopes to receive lenders' support and enlarge his agribusiness so his family will have a better life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":293,"image":{"id":1911249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

Every two weeks, the Primero de Agosto credit group meets there.  The group is made up of 12 women who decided to unite and form this group, which has helped them improve their small businesses and quality of life with loans.  They work doing different activities including sales, services, selling food, and others.  \r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is Ramona, who is 54 years old, married, and has five adult children, one of whom lives with her.  Her husband is a driver and makes deliveries in a truck he owns.\r\n\r\nRamona is a good wife who does everything she can to earn her own income to help with the household expenses.  She works in sales.  She buys chickens from a local farm and brings them back to her home to slaughter and sell to her customers, either whole or in pieces.  She works every day and has a good customer base since she cleans the chickens and weighs and prices them well.  She has done this work for more than five years.  It allows her to earn a living and help her husband, who sometimes does not make much from his deliveries. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan to purchase chickens for weekly sales.  She has participated in two loan cycles with the credit group and she likes the services that the institution offers.  Her dream is for herself and her family to have good health.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6775,"image":{"id":1903270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has been involved in farming for the last seven years, and despite difficulties was able to create a successful farm that produces beautiful fruit. Narine's husband and daughter try to help her around their farm, where she has apricot, apple, peach, plum, and walnut trees. To buy fertilizer and organic pesticides for her orchard, Narine decided to apply for this loan, her first, in the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and SEF.

Ebenezer hopes that in the future, he will be able to own one of the biggest stationary shops in town. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":362.1,"image":{"id":1901286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy photocopying paper, machine, books, and pens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kinubi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2015-06-24T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-24T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.26,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ebenezer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":204143},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":211516},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":219156},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":227072},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":235273},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":243771},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":252576},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":261699},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":271151},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":280945},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":291092},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":301606}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.94},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.22},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.88},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.63},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.75},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":159.3,"local_amount":516643,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:58:02Z","rounded_local_amount":526483.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696518332},{"amount":64.65,"local_amount":211516,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:31:48Z","rounded_local_amount":215544.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.57,"payment_id":711428534},{"amount":66.88,"local_amount":219156,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:31:03Z","rounded_local_amount":223330.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.69,"payment_id":730951223},{"amount":70.01,"local_amount":227072,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-21T13:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":231397.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752042089}],"funded_date":"2015-07-23T14:48:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":905912,"name":"Hanan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanan does not work and her husband works with a low income and she is blessed with two children.

He is very poor, who only has income from his age pension. Khvicha and his mother live alone and it's very hard for them to satisfy even basic needs. Khvicha sometimes cultivates agricultural land and harvest beans and maize, for family-use mostly. \r\n\r\nIn order to increase the income somehow, Khvicha decided to start dairy farming and seek for credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts was unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe startup program, that is joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses.

John appreciates UGAFODE Microfinance Limited and Kiva support.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":635.44,"image":{"id":1903871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to boost his retail stock business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2015-06-24T17:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-24T17:50:01Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.5,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":254.18,"local_amount":833333.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":840026.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696786408},{"amount":126.59,"local_amount":416666.67,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-24T12:20:46Z","rounded_local_amount":420013.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.5,"payment_id":714047026},{"amount":127.09,"local_amount":416666.67,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-23T12:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":420013.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732673786},{"amount":127.08,"local_amount":416666.67,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-22T13:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":420013,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":754866595}],"funded_date":"2015-07-23T17:25:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":905929,"name":"Anahit","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anahit is from Lori Berd village of Lori region.

To sustain her daughter's living, she started a retail business six years ago. Karine trades clothing and shoes supplies from her house. She was able to gather a good client base during her six years of work in the retail business. \r\n\r\nTo purchase new clothing and shoes supplies from spring-summer collection to sell to customers, Karine has applied for this loan. She has been approved for a loan within the framework of the joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

She has a bakery business. She is a good mother who is enterprising, independent, active, reliable, responsible, and very hardworking.  She carries out her business in the Co\u00f1a co\u00f1a neighborhood in the northeastern part of the city.  Here there is a lake used for aquatic sports such as sailboat competitions and other water sports.  The area has a mild and dry climate with a daytime temperature that varies between 18-25 degrees Celsius.   Carla has a dark complexion, brown eyes, brown hair that is tied back, a short stature, and a medium physique.  Her native language is Quechua, which she speaks in her home, and she also speaks Spanish in the general culture and in her business.  She shares her life with her son, who attends school and helps her with the business.  They live in a house made of brick, and cement.  The house has a tin roof, and has electricity and well water accessed by a pump.      \r\n\r\nCarla's desire to increase her income led her to request a loan to improve her business and pay for the educational expenses of her son.  She has a bakery business, and she specializes in making cupcakes and cookies.  A cupcake is a portion of cake for one person that is baked in a mold.  \"We bake and decorate cakes, cupcakes, cookies, and other baked goods for special occasions.  We do our business through orders, because our work is personalized,\" she comments.        \r\n\r\nThe advantage of Carla's business is that she has daily sales and extra personalized work, the disadvantage is that she lacks the capital to buy supplies for her bakery such as molds, flour, sugar, eggs, extracts, and other items.  Carla's dream is to open a bakery in the center of the city.  She wants to increase her sales by purchasing bakery supplies to expand her offerings of cakes. With the profits, she will pay for the educational expenses for her son. This is her 2nd loan with the institution in the 7 years that she has been developing her business.\r\n\r\nThis is why Carla is requesting a loan to buy bakery supplies to bake more cakes, so that with the profits she can pay for her son's educational expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1900562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy bakery supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-24T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-24T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carla Jimena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":437.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":485.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":480.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":534.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":549.51},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":560.07},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":602.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":617.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":644.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":678.86},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":702.76},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":706.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.36},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.39},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.41},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.91},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":135.17,"local_amount":923.1,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:14Z","rounded_local_amount":932.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554840},{"amount":70.36,"local_amount":480.53,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":485.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468927},{"amount":819.47,"local_amount":5596.37,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5654.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296760}],"funded_date":"2015-07-23T15:13:20Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":905997,"name":"Carmen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmen is single, and she lives at her father's house.\r\n\r\nCarmen makes cheese and sells her products at fairs every Sunday.

He has been running a small-scale vegetable farm and has a few cows to fatten and to sell. His business is going quite well. However, he was deeply concerned to see a high price and scarcity of non-renewable cooking gas, high price of chemical fertilizers, and also seeing the cow dung wasted without further processing, while polluting the air with a pungent odor. \r\n\r\nAfter socializing by Yayasan Rumah Energi (YRE) and Lembaga Pengembangan Pertanian Nahdatul Ulama\/LPPNU (a local NGO \u2013 biogas construction partner of YRE) about the Household Biogas (BIRU) program, Agus sees that biogas is a good solution for his problems. He sees an opportunity to reduce his dependence on non-renewable cooking gas. In addition, he also wants to use bio-slurry (biogas residue) as organic fertilizer for his plants. In order to make it happen, Agus invited eight of his friends above to form a farmer group. He is so keen to purchase a bio-digester, but he does not have sufficient capital for it. A loan from Kiva will help him and the other farmer group members to make it possible. \r\n\r\nAgus has optimism that if he can build a bio-digester, he can use the biogas for cooking, and bio-slurry (biogas residue) as fertilizer for his plantation. He also wants to sell the remaining bio-slurry to increase his family income. He hopes that in the future, he can invite all of the farmers in his village to use biogas.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":339.6,"image":{"id":1911949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural

Part of the loan she will use to maaintain her videoke machine. She knows that more items in her store will yield more sales and thus increase her earnings. Her income from her store is a stable source to sustain her family's basic needs and for her four children's schooling. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. \r\n\r\nSusan dreams that her small store will grow into a big grocery store someday.
