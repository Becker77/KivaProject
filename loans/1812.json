The ladies learn to more effectively manage their loans with information about budgeting, marketing, pricing, accounting and sales. Friendship Bridge Facilitators meet with each Trust Bank monthly and in the indigenous language of the ladies, teach through the use of role playing, pictures and diagrams.\n\nJuana is a 45-year-old member of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMariana,\u201d located in the rural area of Santa Mar\u00eda Visitaci\u00f3n in the highlands, about three hours from the capitol. There are seven women in the group located in the village, Mariana. Juana is the president of the trust bank, a role that she takes seriously and proudly. \n\nThe trust bank received their first loan funded by KIVA investors one year ago. They are just about to successfully pay back the entire loan! They are requesting a new loan that they hope will be funded by KIVA investors. Juana will use her loan in her animal husbandry business, as well as in her new business which is the making of candles. She plans to purchase 50 chickens, as well as food to fatten them up, and as she added a new business to her life, now she needs to buy wax and other supplies to make more candles. \n\nThe women in the Trust Bank appreciate the generosity of KIVA investors in funding their much-needed loans. In receiving these loans and managing them effectively, the ladies increase productivity and sales and generate higher income and an improved standard of living for their families.

She has a high school education and is a pensioner. Twenty-five years ago she decided to start her own business which she still runs today. Yakutkhan is a farmer with nine cows and 37 sheep.

She has a university education. In order to earn extra income for her family, Saltanat has been raising livestock and farming since 2009. Thanks to her diligent work Saltanat now has four cows, 12 sheep, and three horses. On her 3 hectare plot she grows alfalfa, wheat, and rice, which she both uses and sells. In order to further develop her business, Saltanat turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase two cows and five sheep. She plans to use the income to further increase her herd.

Almost all businesses in those areas dwindled if not went bankrupt. Sari-saris, or small variety stores, were not exempt from that crisis. Frequent distribution of relief goods to Haiyan-affected communities almost crushed them because the commodities that people needed every day were given to them through relief organizations. It was several months after Haiyan before variety stores started to recover. \r\n<p>\r\nMildred is one of those sari-sari owners. Not only did Haiyan affect her business, but her income also shrank during school breaks and vacations when her customer base diminished. Now that school has begun she needs more inventory such as cookies, chips, candies, canned goods, sachets of toiletries, juices, soft drinks, beverages, and many others. \r\n<p>\r\nThrough Kiva's field partner CCT Credit Cooperative Mildred is now applying for a 12,000 PHP loan to restock her shop. She also plans to use part of the loan to pay for the repair of their tricycle that has been idle for quite some time. \r\n<p>\r\nMildred asks for your kind support to enable her to pay for these needs. May you be God\u2019s blessing to her as she works to develop her business into a grocery store someday.\r\n<p>\r\nAll CCT community clients are organized into fellowship groups of fifteen to thirty members who meet on a weekly basis. There they share stories of their work, repay microfinance loans and draw strength and inspiration from their study of the Word of God. Mildred is a devoted member of CCT and prays for a harmonious relationship with her husband Richard and their children.

She is single and has a 12 year-old son. Her business is selling food. She is a good mother, an entrepreneur, and an understanding, patient, responsible and hardworking person. She carries out her business in the \u201c12 de Marzo\u201d area, considered one of the pioneers of the city. This area has nearly half a million trade unions and is characterized by taking in almost all the streets and avenues. The weather is cold and dry with temperatures during the day that vary between 0-12 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nEva has a dark complexion, brown eyes, and long black hair which she wears braided. She is short and has a medium physique. Eva speaks her native Aymara language with her family and speaks Spanish with the general public and for her business.

She is responsible for preparing lunch and dinner. The popular lunch consists of several courses served one after the other. The first course is an appetizer (a cold dish may be a half boiled egg with shredded carrots) or a traditional soup that can be of different types. The second course is the main course and is usually a piece of meat with vegetables and rice or noodles. The last course is dessert and consists of fruit, an orange or banana. \"I started my business with the help of my former partner, after our separation I ran out of working capital ... \" she says. The advantage of her business is that she counts on returning customers. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy cooking supplies and other supplies like soda, etc. Her dream is to buy supplies for her business so that it can run properly. She wants to buy kitchen supplies wholesale as well as vegetables, meat, oil, pasta, soft drinks, etc. so that she can continue with her business and pay for her child\u2019s expenses. This is the first loan from this institution in the 10 years she has been in this business.

She is married to Isidro and they have children. Isidro is not just her companion in life but also her business buddy. Together, they toil hard in order to uplift their business.\r\n\r\nAs a soft drinks or beverage dealer, Emma buys loads of bottled drinks at a wholesale price then retails it per case or per bottle. She distributes cases of drinks to sari-sari (variety) stores. She has been doing this for 20 long years, and it provided well for their everyday needs. However, the problem in this kind of business is the risk of bottle breakage that consumes a big portion of capital. Aside from this, the unreturned bottles that are considered lost also deplete her capital. \r\n\r\nThe good thing about Emma is that she knows how to roll her everyday budget. She still dreams of putting up her own outlet or stock room. She also plans to nurture a farm as an alternative income-generating venture. She feels that this dream is coming closer to reality, especially if she can avail herself of a PHP 25,000 loan. Part of the loan will be used to buy additional cases of soft drinks, and the rest will be allotted as seed money for her farm. \r\n\r\nHopefully you can extend your heartfelt generosity to her. She is a compliant member of CCT Credit Cooperative and meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to inspire and strengthen each other through the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Working people who want to earn extra money often engage in this business also. It\u2019s easy to venture into a direct-selling business since it typically requires low capital to begin with. Then the entrepreneur or direct selling representative will just enhance the business by expanding her network and properly rolling up capital.\r\n\r\nClarita, of Oton, Iloilo, is a direct-selling representative who sells Avon products. She is married to Jonathan, a laborer, and they have children who are studying in high school. Her husband\u2019s job is occasional and his income cannot suffice for their everyday expenses and the children\u2019s education. This is the reason why Clarita aspires to improve her business with the aid of additional capital amounting to PHP 15,000. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy more Avon products that she can sell to her friends, neighbors and others. She\u2019s positive that this additional capital will give her more profit to support their everyday expenses. Her dream is to have a stable space or a showroom for her business someday. She also desires for a good future for her children and harmonious relationships among her family. \r\n\r\nShe meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and her religion. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

a 35-year-old man. He is married and the happy father of four children. He was born and raised in a working class family and was accustomed to work from childhood. He was not able to go to university because his parents did not have the funds. He remained living with his parents, got married and began rearing animals. Now he has a 10 hectare parcel of land and he has six cows in his herd. His wife milks the cows and takes the milk to market for sale. The milk sells well.\r\n\r\nShuhratjon alone works in his family, and he supports his parents as well as his wife and children. It is difficult for him. At the present time Shuhratjon has applied to MDO Arvand to receive a loan. He wants to expand his business and buy two cows, but he does not have the full amount of money. Shuhratjon thanks you for your support and trust."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":296.34,"image":{"id":1907566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to expand the size of his herd.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Bobojon Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-06-25T14:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-25T14:30:04Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shuhratjon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":6500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":429.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":453.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":449.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":501.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":501.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":515.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":550.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":562.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":584.7},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":612.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":633.27},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":705.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.3},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.9},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.89},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.45},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.94},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.3},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":69.37,"local_amount":429.44,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-01T12:11:51Z","rounded_local_amount":434.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696605130},{"amount":73.33,"local_amount":453.93,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-20T12:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":459.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711524638},{"amount":72.67,"local_amount":449.84,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":454.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731040479},{"amount":80.97,"local_amount":501.23,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":506.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755520150}],"funded_date":"2015-07-23T22:17:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":906403,"name":"Teresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresa has a 10 acre farm in North-Rift area of Kenya where she lives and farms with her family.

40-year old woman. She is married and the mother of three children. Mastona got married on graduation from school. Now she has three children. Her husband is a chauffeur and he also works in construction. It was difficult for him to support the family on his own, and so Mastona decided to start rearing animals. Now she has five cows and ten sheep in her herd. She milks the cows and takes the milk to market for sale. The milk sells well. She also buys and sells livestock. Now she wants to buy feed for the herd, but she does not have enough money. She has therefore applied to MDO Arvand for financial support. Mastona hopes that she will be given the necessary sum. She thanks you for your support and

The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank with a pump, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nKabuwoko Secondary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Alfred ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":140.63,"image":{"id":1912189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

We make our sales for wholesale and for retail,\u201d she says.  The advantage of the business is that the sales are in bulk and made daily.  The disadvantage is the lack of materials; like bolts of fabric, thread, zippers, and buttons, etc. to make the jackets.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan cycle with the institution in the 20 years she has been in this business.  It is for these reasons that Sabina is requesting a loan to buy bolts of fabric in order to make jackets and sell them in other cities.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":320.5,"image":{"id":1903998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy bolts of fabric in order to make jackets and sell them in other cities.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-25T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-25T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-15T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1428,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-08T04:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T04:00:00Z","amount":62.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T04:00:00Z","amount":57.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T04:00:00Z","amount":61.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T04:00:00Z","amount":67.18},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T04:00:00Z","amount":66.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T04:00:00Z","amount":69.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T04:00:00Z","amount":73.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T04:00:00Z","amount":72.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T04:00:00Z","amount":81.45},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T04:00:00Z","amount":82.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T04:00:00Z","amount":85.69},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T04:00:00Z","amount":88.28},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T04:00:00Z","amount":92.47},{"due_date":"2016-08-08T04:00:00Z","amount":94.53},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T04:00:00Z","amount":100.17},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T04:00:00Z","amount":103.68},{"due_date":"2016-11-07T04:00:00Z","amount":100.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.51},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.86},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.71},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.05},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.71},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.75},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.01},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.64},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.89},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.99},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.71},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.28},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":131.19,"local_amount":129.2,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":131.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554856},{"amount":58.51,"local_amount":57.62,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":58.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468942},{"amount":62.58,"local_amount":61.63,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":62.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296775},{"amount":68.22,"local_amount":67.18,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":68.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076930}],"funded_date":"2015-07-21T10:07:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":906432,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emily is 25 years old and married with three children, one of whom is in school.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 1000 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nVictory learning Primary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Kakande ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":315,"image":{"id":1912206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

Today she has three cows, ten sheep, and 50 beehives. Thanks to Kalmira's hard work, her gross monthly profit is 15,600 som (KGS). Kalmira has decided to develop her business and has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) to increase the size of her herd by buying some calves. The proceeds of the loan will permit Kalmira to improve her family's well-being."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1909654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy some calves in order to increase the size of her herd.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Sarysogot village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-06-25T15:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-25T15:40:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kalmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-07-02T17:37:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":906426,"name":"Tahira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tahira is a 41-year old married woman, mother of five children, and is living with her family in Lahore, Pakistan.

In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of 800 PHP a day. <br \/><br \/>To help Anelen continue operations of her general store business she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy grocery items like rice, instant noodles, coffee, eggs, beverages, soap, and shampoo to sell at her store. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her since her store earnings are a great help in their daily sustenance.<br \/><br \/>Anelen dreams of building a bigger store. She prays for God to bless their lives abundantly. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/> * All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She and her husband have raised 3 children together. Uulkan has a secondary education, and she and her husband raise animals and grow crops. They started their farm 30 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Uulkan's hard work, her farm now has 3 cows and 2 horses. Her monthly profit is 19,000 som (KGS), and she also works 1.12 hectares of land, where she typically grows barley. \r\n\r\nIn order to further expand her business, Uulkan has approached Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep to fatten in the pasture and resell. Uulkan plans to use the profits from her loan to continue increasing their number of livestock, and wants to save money for her son's wedding."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1883634,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy some sheep to fatten in the pasture and resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ayutapan village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-06-25T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-25T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.69,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Uulkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2016-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:55:52Z","rounded_local_amount":12804.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696501055},{"amount":195.81,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":12804.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.69,"payment_id":752026288}],"funded_date":"2015-07-23T16:21:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Dermer","image":1862598}},{"id":906511,"name":"Isaiah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isaiah is 28 years old, married to Lydia and supports two children. \r\n\r\nHe has been selling maize grains for the last year and the business earns him KES 11,000 per month. \r\n\r\nHe has applied for his first loan of KES 25,000 from VisionFund Kenya to purchase maize cereal to sell to clients in the market.

She is seeking a loan to aggregate more produce from local farmers at fair prices and use her better understanding of the market conditions and prices to sell at a profit. Your loan will help Emily\u2019s clients to focus on production, rather than sales, and it will help her family to earn better incomes and uplift their livelihood.

They have a small farm and a vegetable garden where they grow food for their own use. She earns a little income with fish farming. There are two ponds with trout where they are kept and fed until they are big enough. Then they are sold, mainly to tourists who come to the area during the summer. The ponds are old and need some renovations. With the help of the loan, Zoia can have the necessary earth-moving and concrete work done.

He is running a food stall that sells fried chicken, a favorite food of most Filipinos. Maybe this is the reason why he chose this kind of enterprise. His usual customers are students, working people and even those staying at home. The recent school opening brings greater demand for his business. Hence he is requesting for additional capital of PhP 8,000 to buy more chicken meat and other ingredients. He will also improve the water-proof canvas covering for his stall in time for the rainy season. \r\n\r\nHe has small children with his wife Ritchell and they are living in Tondo, Manila. They want to see their children finish their schooling so they can have better opportunity to gain a decent living wage.

For long years, he has experienced a lot of ups and downs that made him strong enough in facing life trials. And thank God that Kiva and CCT have been parts of this years-long journey. \r\n\r\nAlmost four years ago, he was given a chance to have a loan amounting PHP 10,000 that he used for the maintenance of his buy-and-sell(footwear) business. But aside from the mentioned inventory, he also owns a tricycle unit. This time, he asks for PHP 20,000 for the maintenance of his tricycle unit. He hopes that you'll help him again with his request. \r\n\r\nJaime hopes to have a successful future far beyond their life today. Every week, he meets up with his co-fellowship members* to share stories of his work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":393.75,"image":{"id":1912108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay for the maintenance of his tricycle unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-25T22:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-25T22:50:04Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":833.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":2499.99,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2541.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314714},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":4166.65,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4235.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523462},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.32,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3388.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433891},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3388.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954810},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":4166.65,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4235.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044694}],"funded_date":"2015-06-26T17:04:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":906589,"name":"Flordeliza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flordeliza is 30-years-old and has two children.

Her aspirations are to eventually go to university to study law."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1912385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase more clothes for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Chiredzi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":305,"posted_date":"2015-06-25T22:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-25T22:50:07Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chipo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2016-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711430628},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730952985},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:09:36Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752043526}],"funded_date":"2015-07-09T22:11:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":896487,"name":"Carmelina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmelina and her husband live in the jungle area of the state of Chiapas, in the locality of Las Perlas.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore, has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nKisosso School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

She experienced so much poverty because of lack of education and to keep her children from the track, she is working very hard to make sure that her children will finish their studies, no matter what. \r\n\r\nShe's into a meat-selling business right now. She buys meat of pork in a huge quantity then sells them per kilo at a given cost. By this, she maintains daily living for the household and is able to support her husband as well in establishing the family status. \r\n\r\nShe wants to improve her sales, and this would not happen if she doesn't have enough resources. To say, she is requesting a loan that will fully carry the expenses of buying more supplies of meat to sell. PHP 9,000 would be enough. She hopes to touch your kind hearts. She's doing this only for her family. \r\n\r\nShe meets every week with her *co-fellowship members to share stories of her work and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. * All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1912198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to be used in buying more supplies of meat to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-25T23:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-25T23:20:06Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emily ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.36,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2409.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681314718},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3011.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523466},{"amount":53.32,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2409.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433895},{"amount":26.66,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1204.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954814}],"funded_date":"2015-06-26T03:27:41Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":906599,"name":"Blessing","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Blessing is 33 years old and a single mother of one child.

Nicolas, 59 years old, still finds them as a way to generate a living.\r\n\r\nHere is his story.\r\n\r\nSince, trash is not well-managed in the country and just thrown anywhere along the sidewalks and riverbanks, street dwellers usually collect such things that are still recyclable from junks like copper, papers, plastics and metals. After collecting, their next destination is to the junk shop where they sell such for a corresponding price depending on the material. Usually, metals cost higher. Junk shops then stack, clean and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries and factories.\r\n\r\nHowever, stable income from this kind of business is hardly predictable. Sometimes, the revolving fund that the junk shop operators use is not enough.\r\n\r\nThis is why Nicolas is taking out a loan worth PHP 20,000 to add up for his current revolving fund and to use for improving the shop. \r\n\r\nWith her wife, Marie, they are truly hopeful that someday their lives will get better and they will be able to renovate their house. He meets up with his co-fellowship** members to share stories of his life and business every week and where he draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
