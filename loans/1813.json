What do you study at the Maharishi Institute? Which classes do you enjoy the most?\r\n\r\nI am doing a business management degree. I enjoy working with numbers; my favorite classes are from courses or subjects that involve numbers, e.g., mathematics, financial management and accounting.\r\n\r\n2. What are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? Please be specific: In which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\n\r\nMy goal is to work for a couple of years to gain necessary skills and experiences. Thereafter, I would love to travel abroad to countries like the United States of America, Australia, Canada, Qatar and UK. I would really love to see myself working in the business, consulting and management sector. The best cities and most ideal cities I would love to be working in are New York City and Sydney (Australia).\r\n\r\n3.Tell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children?\r\n\r\nI was born in DR Congo and I moved to South Africa at a very young age of 5 years old. My parents divorced back in 1999; my older brother Oliver and I were the only two kids my parents had. After the divorce my father remarried his new wife, and they had three kids together, all females. My mom remarried too and had four kids, two females and two males. All in all, I have eight siblings and I am the only child from both my parents' children who finished matric and is currently studying at a tertiary institute.\r\n\r\n4. What do you like to do in your spare time?\r\n\r\nIn my spare time I like reading books or catching a movie with my friends. When I have enough spare time I love doing community work in my community. I found so much joy in helping others; this is the main reason I love doing the community work that I do.\r\n\r\n5. How will a Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: Will there be significant changes?\r\n\r\nThe loan will definitely help me in so many ways which will bring a whole lot of changes to my life. My primary problem has always been transportation. This loan will help me cover my transport cost and increase my attendance rate.

She has three children, the youngest of whom is three years old.  Anara works in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities which constitute her family's main source of income.  She started in this field in 2005 with an initial capital of 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, she now has one cow and ten sheep on her farm.  She also grows barley for resale on one hectare of land.

She lives in her parents\u2019 house, which she extended to make a five-room house thanks to her cross-border trading business. Many of Caroline\u2019s peers who graduated from Zimbabwe\u2019s tertiary institutions have failed to get a white- or blue-collar job. Many have therefore crossed the border to neighbouring South Africa to seek employment.\r\n\r\nUnlike her colleagues, Caroline never prioritised looking for a white-collar job. In fact, she did not attend tertiary education as the cost of education was high and her parents could not afford it. This worsened as the economy started crumbling and she resorted to self-employment. She travels to South Africa to buy clothes, blankets and shoes and sells them in Mozambique. She crosses the border to Mozambique once every two weeks to sell her goods. She has been focused and is willing to take chances to make it through. Although her business is highly competitive with many traders selling the same products, Caroline has mastered the art of marketing. She calls out to her customers in their local language and builds relationships with them to encourage loyalty and repeat sales. \r\n\r\nCaroline wishes to own her house, and the only way she can do that is working hard and growing her business. She formed a group with her friends and they have attended financial training at Thrive to help them better manage their businesses. They hope that a loan from Kiva will help them expand their businesses and someday build houses of their own.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":966.68,"image":{"id":1907687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To expand the range of clothes she can sell abroad.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-06-26T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-26T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mable","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Priscah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anatoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":241.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":242,"local_amount":242,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":242,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696747252},{"amount":241,"local_amount":241,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":241,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711678931},{"amount":242.01,"local_amount":242.01,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:29:53Z","rounded_local_amount":242.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731183058},{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":241.67,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:51:49Z","rounded_local_amount":241.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752271205}],"funded_date":"2015-07-18T03:50:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":906731,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John, who lives in Hoima, Uganda, is aged 35 years.

It is characterized by its picturesque landscape covered by tropical vegetation. It possesses an important abundance of forest and wild animal diversity. It is a collection center for field products and has an average annual temperature of 24 degrees centigrade. \r\nAndrea is dark skinned, has brown eyes and wears her black hair tied up. She is short, has a robust physical complexion, her native tongue is the Guarani which she speaks with her family and Spanish due to general culture and the business she runs (she is standing, wearing the blue blouse).\r\nShe enjoys her life in the company of her partner, who works as a plumber, and her baby. They live in their own room, built out of wood with a calamine roof and soil floor, which has water from a well dispensed via a water pump, electricity and no sewage system.\r\nHer desire for self improvement to pay for the postnatal expenses of her baby led her to start a communal bank of people with business such as: sales of second hand clothing, cosmetic sales via catalog, construction service, empanada sales, breakfast sales, beauty parlor and a cattle business, to request a loan and improve their activities.\r\nHer business is the sales of traditional food, she runs this business Monday through Saturday, during the middle of the day at her outdoors, stationary locale. The traditional foods which are in highest demand are: 'locotos rellenos' (stuffed peppers with ground beef and onions), 'arroz con queso' (rice, milk and cheese) and 'aji de panza' (belly beef, onions, tomatoes and rice). \"thanks to this business, I can cover the postnatal expenses of my baby...\" she explains. The advantage of her business is that the demand and the necessity exists, but the disadvantage is the lack of capital to purchase more kitchen ingredients such as: oil, rice, noodles, yucca, meat, etc. Her dream is to see her son grow up in the best conditions, she wants to expand her business through the purchase of kitchen ingredients such as: oil, rice, noodles, eggs, meat, potatoes,  freeze-dried potatoes, etc., in order to serve more clients and improve her sales.\r\nThis is the first sequence of loans with the institution in the two years which she has been performing this activity. These are the motives behind Andrea's request of a loan to purchase kitchen ingredients for the sale of food and with the benefits be able to pay the medical expenses of her baby."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":1904294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"purchase kitchen materials for the sale of food and with the benefits, be able to pay for the medical expenses of her baby.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-26T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-26T14:40:01Z","loan_amount":3500,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yohanny","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Leidy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-15T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-29T04:00:00Z","amount":1807.62},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T04:00:00Z","amount":1840.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T04:00:00Z","amount":1874.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":1908.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T04:00:00Z","amount":1942.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T04:00:00Z","amount":1978.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T04:00:00Z","amount":2014.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T04:00:00Z","amount":2050.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T04:00:00Z","amount":2088.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T04:00:00Z","amount":2126.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T04:00:00Z","amount":2164.9},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T04:00:00Z","amount":2204.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.41},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":273.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.27},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":288.49},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":310.07},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":321.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":805.31,"local_amount":5522.15,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5556.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344633},{"amount":561.6,"local_amount":3850.96,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3874.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554859},{"amount":582.23,"local_amount":3992.43,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4017.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468945},{"amount":603.62,"local_amount":4139.08,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4164.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296778},{"amount":947.24,"local_amount":6495.38,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":6535.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076933}],"funded_date":"2015-06-26T16:12:09Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Samuel Martinez","image":null}},{"id":901142,"name":"Ruperta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Ruperta de 52 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica al comercio de calzados (zapatos), vive en Sucre y en su domicilio tiene su negocio de venta de calzado, tiene 1 dependiente econ\u00f3mico que es su hija y ambas viven en alquiler, su actividad la realiza durante todo el a\u00f1o,los ingresos de su actividad le sirven para cubrir los gastos de alimentaci\u00f3n, ropa, servicios b\u00e1sicos y otros gastos que incurren en su hogar.

In my country, it isn't easy to be an artisan. It's a challenge, and you have to go knocking on doors to be able to show your designs.

Her business brings in around 20,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to develop her business, Tamara applied for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) with Bai Tushum Bank to buy horses to fatten at pasture. She plans to use the earnings from the loan to invest in additional livestock in order to save money to buy a car."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1883637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy horses to fatten at pasture","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Gulcha village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-06-26T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-26T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":47.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tamara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2015-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":625,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":37778.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696501064},{"amount":577.71,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:08:11Z","rounded_local_amount":37778.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":47.29,"payment_id":752026297}],"funded_date":"2015-07-24T13:13:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Hendrickson","image":null}},{"id":906809,"name":"Nicolas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nicolas is 43 years old.

Her youngest son is 16. Gulmira has a high school education and has earned the main income for her family over the last 15 years by raising livestock and planting crops. Thanks to Gulmira's perseverance, determination, and hard work, she currently has three cows. She also has a 0.32 hectare plot of her own land and rents a 0.18 hectare plot where she grows corn and potatoes to consume on the farm and to sell. Her monthly income is 18,500 som (KGS), which is not enough to live on, so Gulmira decided to apply for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) with Bai Tushum Bank to buy four young bulls and calves to increase her livestock headcount and her family's income. Gulmira intends to expand her business, which will inevitably lead to an increase in her family's income and allow her to repair her house in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1142.42,"image":{"id":1909664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

There are also 1.0 hectares of rented irrigated land where Ainura grows barley for sale. In order to develop her business further, Ainura has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to increase the size of her herd by buying a cow and a heifer.

Which classes do you enjoy the most?\r\nAt the Maharishi Institute I am currently studying a BBA degree; my favorite classes are Marketing, Human Resources and Economics, because I love to interact with people and sitting with people, brain picking them about what they are thinking and working with numbers.\r\n \r\n2.\tWhat are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? Please be specific: in which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\nMy goals are to become a world known Marketing Director, working for PRIMEDIA, because you have to start slow and develop and grow yourself before you can go play with the big dogs. The Marketing department is where my heart is, the rush of coming up with an advert concept is mind blowing for me, which is why I want to see myself there.\r\n\r\n3.\tTell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children?\r\nI was born and breed here in Gauteng; I stay at Soweto with both my parents and my three sisters. I am the second born. Since my family is a big family and most of the people do not work. My mother chose to take two of my cousins to take care of them, because their parents could not. My father has not worked in 10 years, my mother has been a domestic worker since she got let go from her previous work. After that things became very bad, because both my parents were struggling to maintain this huge family. Then I had to go out and look for a small part time job, which made me suffer because my school work took strain. Later on my mom found out about the Maharishi Institute, but we still cannot afford to pay the minimum fee of R200 a month. I really enjoy attending the institute because they do not only focus on feeding you with knowledge but they also help you grow at your potential best.\r\n\r\n4.\tWhat do you like to do in your spare time?\r\nDuring my spare time I enjoy reading a lot and also to the gym to stay healthy mentally and physically. I also go to my nearest old age home to help them wash and clean around the home, and also sit and read for the old people. My love for being with people has grown but lately I have not had much time to myself because of school.\r\n\r\n5.\tHow will Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: will there be significant changes?\r\nThe kiva loan will help me a lot because it will help me with being able to pay back my student loan and also with the small money I will get for myself, it will help me with paying all my expenses. Mostly what I really need it for is for me to be able to pay back my student loan while am still studying. My lifestyle would completely change because I will depend on myself and give my parents some space to breathe and take care of my other siblings.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":16.6,"image":{"id":1903601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for one year tuition fees and living expenses at the Maharishi Institute.

This is Bernardus, one of Ruma\u2019s agents who lives in Magelang, Indonesia. He is happily married and he and his wife have two sons and one daughter. As a main source of income, he owns and manages a small stall that sells consumer products. \r\n\r\nHe joined Ruma last year. He is excited to learn more about mobile technology from Ruma\u2019s mobile application. \r\nBy supporting this loan you will be providing extra working capital for Bernardus' shop. This will allow Bernardus to become an agent for Ruma\u2019s layaway product, Mapan, which is designed for lower-income communities.. Mapan enables customers to save money, little by little, by depositing change at places like Bernardus' business. As their balances grow, customers can make major asset purchases like housewares, appliances, and school supplies for their children. As a Mapan agent, Bernardus is responsible for processing deposits from customers into their Mapan accounts as well as receiving orders from customers who want to buy products listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer orders, Bernardus will submit the order via SMS and, within five to 10 days, the product will be delivered to the customer. With Mapan, Bernardus believes that his local community will be able to have access to higher quality products at lower prices. \r\n\r\nBernardus, who is in the photo, is thankful for your kind support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1913009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to provide additional working capital to help introduce Ruma's new savings plan for low-income communities..","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Magelang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-06-26T17:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-26T17:50:04Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernardus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":7000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-07-24T03:50:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":906878,"name":"Fatima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatima is 48 years old, married, and has three children.\r\n\r\nShe runs an agricultural business raising pigs in the Philippines.

Babee Joy and her husband hope to bestow a priceless inheritance to their children, which is education. \r\n\r\nAs of now, Babee Joy needs additional capital to buy more piglets to raise including enough feeds and vitamins for them.

Muborakhon also engages in trade in her spare time. She sells cooking oil. \r\n\r\nMuborakhon loves to support herself through honest acquired work, thus she spends a lot of time on the fields. She has planted tomatoes and corn on one half of the fields. On the remaining half, Muborakhon has planted cotton. \r\n\r\nThere is little time left for harvesting the cotton, and Muborakhon needs to go over the cotton with mineral fertilisers in order to harvest high-quality and good cotton.

province of Zambia. She hopes to keep growing her mobile money transfer business for her children so that she can be able to provide a better education and life for them. After using loans through Kiva to boost her business and earn more profits, Grace managed to get her three children from her mother and now lives with them. This makes her happy.\r\n\r\nToday, Grace has fully repaid her two previous loans from Kiva. She has a total number of eight mobile money transfer outlets and employs 10 people throughout her network within the eastern province of Zambia. She spends her days moving around from one outlet to the next to insure that the customers are being served and her employees are happy. Grace mainly employs people straight out of high school trying to raise money for college. She explains that this is important to her as she understands the importance of a good education. \r\n\r\nGrace is requesting her third loan in order for her to open an additional outlet. She has identified a spot in Kuita, a market where people still do not have access to good financial services.

With this loan, she will be able to improve her family\u2019s finances and have a nicer house for her family to live in. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Siek wants to buy more farmland, save money to build a new house, and help her children achieve higher education.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":222.24,"image":{"id":1913193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy zinc sheets to renovate her house and a calf to fatten and sell ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Takeo province","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":9,"posted_date":"2015-06-26T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-26T22:50:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Siek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":55.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":55.56,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:59:39Z","rounded_local_amount":55.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696599503},{"amount":111.12,"local_amount":111.12,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-24T12:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":111.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":713930032},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":55.56,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:48:14Z","rounded_local_amount":55.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752123575}],"funded_date":"2015-07-01T00:47:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":907027,"name":"Maricel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maricel is a married woman with three children.

He is 29 years old and lives with his mother and both of them are teachers at a local school. Irakli also earns a living through agriculture. Specifically, he owns a plot of agricultural land, where he grows maize and nut trees and also has a small vineyard. \r\n\r\nIn addition the family has a cow.
