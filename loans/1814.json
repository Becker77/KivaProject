Also, on a plot measuring 2.80 hectares, she raises potatoes, wheat, and clover for resale. Her monthly income comes to approximately 6,000 som (KGS). However, these funds are at times catastrophically insufficient for a dignified life for her family. \r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to further develop her business, Ainagul has applied to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy livestock.

Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has three cows and ten sheep on her farm and makes a monthly income of about 11,000 som (KGS).

Emiliana works Mondays to Fridays for lunch time. \"I worked in a hospital kitchen for several years. Currently I sell food and I want to open a corner shop,\" she says. The advantage to her business is that she has daily sales, the disadvantage is the constant work in the kitchen which tires her out at her age. Her dream is to open a corner shop in order to have a second activity and to be able to rest at home. In the corner shop she wants to sell staple foods. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 30 years that she has been working at her

Su negocio lo desarrolla en la zona \u2018plan 3000\u2019 localizado al sur de la ciudad, caracterizada por la multiculturalidad de sus pobladores; Aymar\u00e1s, Quechuas y Guaran\u00edes, migrantes del todos los rincones del pa\u00eds, se apropiaron de la zona formando un comercio constante, de clima c\u00e1lido sub tropical con una temperatura que var\u00eda durante el d\u00eda entre 21-35 grados cent\u00edgrados.\nPaola es de tez morena, ojos pardos, cabello negro largo lo usa amarrado, baja estatura, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica robusta, su lengua materna es el guaran\u00ed que habla en familia y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y por el negocio que desarrolla (al centro viste, polera rosada y calza marr\u00f3n). Su vida la disfruta en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su pareja que trabaja como constructor y con sus hijos que todav\u00eda no se encuentran en edad escolar, viven en un cuarto propio construido de madera con techo de calamina y piso de tierra que cuenta con agua potable, energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y alcantarillado. Sus deseos de generar mejores ingresos para el bienestar de sus bebes la llev\u00f3 a liderar la banca de personas con negocios como; venta de vajillas, venta de celulares, venta de carne de pollo, venta de flores, servicio de t\u00e9, venta de medicinas naturales y panader\u00eda, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y prosperar en sus negocios. Su negocio es la venta de Queques; El queque es un bizcocho que contiene ingredientes como; az\u00facar, miel, coco rallado, leche, huevos, harina, ralladura de lim\u00f3n o de naranja, polvos de hornear y bicarbonato, \u201cmetemos la masa al horno por 30 minutos, Cuando se enfr\u00eda la cortamos en cuadros y la vendemos al paso...\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que cuenta con ventas diarias, la desventaja es la falta de capital para la compra de variedades de harinas como harina de arroz, de ma\u00edz y otras, para hornear nuevas variedades. Su sue\u00f1o es abrir una panader\u00eda, ella desea realizar la compra de variedades de harinas por quintal para hornear diferentes tipos de queques y abrir una panader\u00eda. Esta es la 3 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 2 a\u00f1os que desarrolla esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Paola solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de variedades de harina para hornear varios tipos de queques y abrir una panader\u00eda.\n","en":"Paola is a 20-year-old woman who lives with her partner and her two children, ages 2 and 4. Her business is selling cakes.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, enterprising, independent, constant, responsible and very hard working. Her business is developing in the \u201cPlan 3000\u201d zone, located to the south of the city. It is known for its multi-cultural population: Aymaras, Quechuas, and Guaranies \u2013 migrants from all corners of the country. They have moved into the zone, creating a constant commerce. The climate is hot, sub-tropical, with a termperature that varies during the day between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nPaola has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair fastened in back. She is short in stature and physically robust. Her maternal tongue is Guarani which she speak with her family and she speaks Spanish among the general populace and in her business. (You will see her in the center of the photo in a pink shirt and maroon sandals.) \r\n\r\nShe leads her life accompanied by her partner, who is a construction worker, and her children, all of whom are school age. They live in a single room they built of wood with a corrugated roof and a dirt floor. They have potable water, electricity and a sewage system.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling \u201ccakes\u201d \u2013 a biscuit containing ingredients like sugar, honey, shredded coconut, milk eggs, flour, shredded lime or orange, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda. Paola says \u201cwe put the batter in the oven for 30 minutes. When it cools we cut it into squares and sell it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer goal of generating more income for the well being of her children led her to join this bank, which is composed of people with businesses such as selling table services, cell phones, chicken, flowers, tea, natural medicines, and bread -- in order to request loans and prosper in business. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her own business is that she can count on daily sales. The disadvantage is her lack of capital to purchase [in bulk] the required variety of flour \u2013 rice flour, corn flour, etc. \u2013 needed to bake new varieties. \r\n\r\nPaula's dream is to open a bakery. She wants to be able to purchase a variety of flour by the  hundred-weight so that she can bake different types of cakes and open a bakery. This is her third round of loans through this institution during her two years involved in this activity.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons why Paula is requesting a loan \u2013 to purchase a variety of flour to bake various types of \u201ccakes\u201d and open her own bakery.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375.01,"image":{"id":1905470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"purchase a variety of flour for baking various types of \"cakes\" and open a bakery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-27T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-27T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":3625,"lender_count":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fortunata Claudi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-16T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T04:00:00Z","amount":1299.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T04:00:00Z","amount":1388.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-29T04:00:00Z","amount":1413.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T04:00:00Z","amount":1439.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T04:00:00Z","amount":1465.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":1492.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T04:00:00Z","amount":1519.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T04:00:00Z","amount":1547.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T04:00:00Z","amount":1575.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T04:00:00Z","amount":1604.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T04:00:00Z","amount":1633.27},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T04:00:00Z","amount":1651.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T04:00:00Z","amount":1702.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T04:00:00Z","amount":1724.03},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T04:00:00Z","amount":1755.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T04:00:00Z","amount":1787.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.53},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.35},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.43},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.82},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":249.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.53},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":259.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1016.08,"local_amount":7007.51,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":7010.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554863},{"amount":436.74,"local_amount":3012,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3013.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468948},{"amount":452.78,"local_amount":3122.62,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3124.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296782},{"amount":469.41,"local_amount":3237.33,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3238.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076936}],"funded_date":"2015-07-23T05:55:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":907348,"name":"Night","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Night is 39 years old, and lives in the town of Lyantonde in the Mbarara region of Uganda.

She is well known in the area where she lives as she worked for 22 years in the Coronado City Hall as a secretary. Because of her experience and years of working handling judicial matters they assigned her criminal cases, misdemeanors, and pensions. She resigned the position on medical advice in order to once again achieve balance in her life.\r\n\r\nAfter retiring she wanted to invest her pension settlement into something really important and then she remembered that her husband was going to abandon the leather goods business that was so hard to start ten years before because he could not continue due to lack of working capital. It was at that moment that Yelba had the thought of investing her pension payment to buy equipment for the family leather goods shop. From the moment she became more involved in the work they noticed improvements and an increase in customers. What Yelba has done up until now is handle negotiations, the purchasing of raw materials, and merchandise delivery trips.\r\n\r\nThe leather goods shop has been in business for 20 years and Yelba has been actively participating in it for 10 years. She needs to invest the requested amount in the purchase of raw materials. The last investment that she made was for the purchase of an industrial punching press to facilitate their work in order to work faster because the clients are asking for more products. This is why she is asking for the loan. \r\n\r\nThis leather goods business has always been one of quality with excellent finish, because they have the necessary machines to achieve the finish. Their products are varied and always carry a Costa Rican seal as it reflects the culture with their art, the making of earrings, key rings, wallets, handbags, bracelets and other leather goods. They sell these products to businesses and cruise ships from Lim\u00f3n, Tamarindo, Liberia, Puntarenas, Nicoya, Jaco, Dominical, Flamingo, Paquera, Brasilito, Samara y Playas del Coco.\r\n\r\nIn this leather goods business Yelba\u2019s husband and two sons create the leather goods and during high season, such as these months, they hire two Nicaraguan neighbors who have enough experience to collaborate.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":193.99,"image":{"id":1733198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"for the purchase of raw materials for the family leather good shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"San Jos\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2015-06-27T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-27T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yelba Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":29283.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":29722.73},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":30168.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":30621.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":31080.41},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":31546.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":32019.81},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":32500.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":32987.61},{"due_date":"2016-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33482.43},{"due_date":"2016-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33984.66},{"due_date":"2016-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":34494.43},{"due_date":"2016-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":35011.85},{"due_date":"2016-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":35537.03},{"due_date":"2016-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":36070.08},{"due_date":"2017-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":36611.13},{"due_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":37160.3},{"due_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":37717.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.73},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.41},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.27},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.15},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.04},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.94},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.85},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.78},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.68},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.65},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.63},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.63},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.65},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.67},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":193.99,"local_amount":103462.37,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-19T12:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":103988.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731625145}],"funded_date":"2015-06-29T15:00:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":907379,"name":"Rosert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosert is 40 years old and lives in the town of Ibanda in the Mbarara region of Uganda.

She lives with her partner, and she has a 14 year old son and a 16 year old daughter. She sells traditional Bolivian shawls (\"Cholita shawls\"). She is a good mother and businesswoman: persevering, independent, responsible and hard-working. She developed her business in the neighborhood of \"Cruce Villa Adela\". It is known for being host to a lot of institutions, such as parishes and institutes of higher education. Most importantly, the neighborhood hosts the polyclinic, which cares for the citizens who live in the area.\r\n\r\nWilma has a dark complexion, brown eyes and long black hair which she keeps in a braid. She is short, physically strong and dresses in traditional clothing (hat, shawl and traditional skirt). Her mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks with her family. She also speaks Spanish for everyday use and to conduct business. She lives with her partner, who works in construction, as well as with her children, who are in school. They live in their own house, constructed from bricks and cement, with a calamine roof and a wooden floor. The house has running water, electricity, gas and a sewage system.\r\n\r\nHer business is the sale of Cholita shawls. A \"cholita\" is a woman who dresses in traditional clothes. Part of her dress is the shawl, which she uses to protect her back and shoulders from the cold. \"I started the business selling \"polleras\" (traditional skirts). I move around selling my goods and I already have regular customers.\" she says. The advantage of her business is that her sales are steady.

She is married and has 6 children with 5 of them currently in school. For the past 5 years, Christine has been working hard to manage her charcoal business, which sells charcoal.  \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Christinen has requested a loan of 4000000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more sacks of charcoal to increase her stock. This will help Christine to generate greater profits and have a car that will help her transport the charcoal to her customers. Christine hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business and own a bigger store so as to start supplying all small charcoal stores around town. \r\n\r\nChristine is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Christine who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":351.91,"image":{"id":1913711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

She sells products such as groceries, grains and milk products, among others. She acquired this business after her father in law passed it down as an inheritance to his grandchildren and to her. For developing her grocery store she has three storage cases in good shape and three cooling chambers from commercial businesses as well as shelving for displaying the merchandise.\r\n\r\nThere is a marketplace she attends with the products she sells during the 12 months of the year since she lives in a very populated neighborhood. To differentiate herself from the competition she purchases plumbing items such as piping, coupling, glue, sandpaper and faucets, among others. Since many of her customers request these items and there is not a hardware store nearby, she transforms her business into an option to beat the competition. Additionally, she will include school supplies and books so that the business is more complete.

There have been many let-downs, but thanks to her faith in God and in herself, Oysha has been able to overcome the obstacles in her path.  Oysha managed to raise her sons and get them standing on their own two legs.

He has 2 sons of 3 and 13 years and 2 daughters of 1 and 18 years. His business is the manufacture of geometric cases. He is a good father, enterprising, independent, consistent, responsible, and very hardworking. He develops his business in the \"16 de julio\" [July 16] area, where the country's largest trade fair takes place Thursdays and Sundays from early hours of the morning, a fair where any kind of things needed can be found.\r\n\r\nLeonardo has dark complexion and brown eyes, uses magnifying glasses, has short black hair, and is of short stature and medium physique. His mother tongue is Aymara, which he speaks among family, and speaks Spanish because of general culture and the business he does. He shares his life with his wife who sells food, and his children; the oldest girl already finished school, the second son is studying in school and the 2 youngest are not yet of school age. They live in a home of their own, built of brick and cement with a tin roof and wooden floor that features water, electricity, domestic gas, and sewerage services. \r\n\r\nHis business is the production of geometric cases for teachers and tailors. These serve to draw plane and straight or curved lines geometric figures and comprise graduated rulers, squares, protractors, and compasses. \"I started my job as an assistant in a company that manufactures educational games. There, I met my customers and managed to become independent...\", he says. The advantage of his business is that he has consistent customers; the disadvantage is the lack of capital for the purchase of wood and other materials needed for the production.
