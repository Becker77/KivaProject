He did neither have experience as a baker, nor education. \r\n\r\nThanks to his perseverance and decisiveness he learned to bake tasty traditional cakes and after some time he opened his own bakery. To open a new bakery and attract customers was not easy, but through the years, with improvements in product quality and a good reputation, Dadojon managed to get many customers. He treated every customer with respect and served them as quickly and efficiently as possible - and he still does so. \r\n\r\nNow Dadojon is the happy father of four children, and a faithful husband. He is 38 years old. His wife helps him with the work at the bakery, and this has become a family business. When his children grow up, Dadojon will teach them his trade, just like his teacher taught him. \r\n\r\nCurrently the number of customers is increasing, and at the same time Dadojon's children and expenses are growing. Dadojon and his wife  took a decision to open another bakery. In order to open a new bakery, the need to purchase a kneader, install a stove and renovate the premises to adjust them to a bakery.

His business is located in the '16 de julio' area which is known for its market, considered the country's largest, where you can find everything from a pin to an agricultural tractor. The weather is cold and dry, with temperatures during the day varying between 0 and 12 degrees celsius.\r\n\r\nJavier has dark complexion, brown eyes, short black hair, and is of short, slight build.

They live in their own home built of brick and cement with a tin roof and wooden floor. It has running water, electricity, domestic gas and a sewerage system. \r\n\r\nHe makes a living from upholstery, which involves covering household chairs, and car, motorcycle and boat seats with fabric or other materials, and then fixing the material with tacks or staples. The level of comfort is improved by placing springs, foam or vegetable fibers inside. \"All the upholsterers I know have learned the trade from the bottom. I started very young as an assistant in a upholstery shop and after a few years experience in this work I set up my own business. Even after seven years of it I'm still learning,\" he says.

Her husband and daughters live with her, but the house is built on her parents\u2019 land and they are their neighbours.\r\n\r\nJacoba\u2019s job is teaching Christian classes at a church in her community. She hopes that with this teaching, the children will grow up with good moral education and not seek out criminal groups. Before she began this work, Jacoba looked after household duties and worked in a co-op cutting and fertilizing coffee. Now, her workplace is 30 minutes away from her home and her workday is 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon and 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.\r\n\r\nShe needs this loan to buy fertilizers, herbicides and fungicides to prepare her corn crops, as it is now the ideal time to do so. With this help she will be sure of good grain production, part of which she will be able to sell and the rest of which will be left for her family to eat.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Jacoba wishes to be able to build another room in her house so that her daughters can have more space and a better quality of life. She would also like to be able to help them so that they can study the subjects they like the most."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1905713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizers, herbicides and fungicides to prepare her corn crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-06-28T13:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-28T13:30:06Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacoba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-06-28T21:09:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlotte Doane","image":1930601}},{"id":907470,"name":"Neli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Neli is a 61-year-old widow from the village of Mleta.

This is her first series of loans with this institution in the seven years she has been developing this business.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons that Lisbeth is requesting a loan to buy supplies for the sale and production of peanuts and broad beans, and with the profits, she will buy milk for her baby.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":295.93,"image":{"id":1905709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy supplies for the sale and production of peanuts and broad beans, and with the profits, buy milk for her baby.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-28T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-28T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lisbeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-18T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-02T04:00:00Z","amount":386.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T04:00:00Z","amount":514.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T04:00:00Z","amount":551.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T04:00:00Z","amount":575.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T04:00:00Z","amount":588.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T04:00:00Z","amount":629.59},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T04:00:00Z","amount":639.85},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T04:00:00Z","amount":681.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T04:00:00Z","amount":709.76},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T04:00:00Z","amount":723.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.31},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.9},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.82},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.42},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.51},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.31,"local_amount":386.12,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":388.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554869},{"amount":75.02,"local_amount":514.43,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:56Z","rounded_local_amount":517.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468954},{"amount":80.44,"local_amount":551.58,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":555,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296787},{"amount":84.16,"local_amount":577.12,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":580.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076941}],"funded_date":"2015-07-25T22:53:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlotte Doane","image":1930601}},{"id":907487,"name":"Drocelle","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Drocelle is 27 years old.

After she relocated to San Diego from Detroit in 2005 with her son and husband, she began working as a mortgage consultant. At the same time, she was also pursuing a degree in counseling and psychology. By the end of her degree program, she decided that she did not want to be a therapist directly, so instead she decided to pursue coaching. <br \/><br \/>She began her business, All The Way Success, in May 2009. All The Way Success is a training and development company providing workshops, seminars, and coaching for businesses from small sole-proprietorship up to large corporations. <br \/><br \/>Her business focuses on training surrounding leadership development, team building, systems and processes, and marketing. Up to this point, the business has been serving mostly small sole-proprietor businesses; however, these businesses run into cash flow issues and therefore are unable to pay for the services in a timely manner. Therefore, Rae has begun to work with larger, more established corporations to ensure income stability throughout the year. <br \/><br \/>To market her business, Rae participates in a number of speaking engagements, especially at large conferences. She speaks at approximately two to three events or conferences per month. She encourages potential clients to have a \u2018discovery session\u2019 with her, so they can see how her services will benefit them. She also offers webinars, and has been working on developing a strong Facebook and LinkedIn presence.  <br \/><br \/>Rae will use her Kiva loan to update her website, hire a part-time employee, and purchase inventory to re-sell at conferences, namely a book she has written about entrepreneurship.<br \/><br \/>With your help, Rae can expand her business and assist more business owners around California. <br \/><br \/>Find out more about Rae:

Village. Both Malis and her husband always get up early to go to the farm and prepare their grocery shop. \r\n\r\nMalis's grocery shop is quite famous in this area. Most of the villagers in this area are her regular customers. Therefore, her business is pretty busy which makes her forget to charge her current energy source sometimes. A car battery is not reliable, as it has a short life span and is easily damaged. Sometimes the car battery runs out of energy without any alert, and Malis has to stop her business early before the sun sets. \r\n\r\nAfter getting a good recommendation from a neighbor that uses a solar home system, she decided to apply for a Kiva loan to buy a solar home system. She believes this decision will improve her energy to run her business and also save utility fees. She won't have to worry about sudden power shut offs and wasting time charging the battery anymore.

Their business needs a lot of preparation before they can distribute a product. Therefore, they need to get up early to prepare their shop before sun rises. Currently, they use car batteries to provide their business energy. However, car batteries are not reliable; they have a short life span and are easily damaged. Sometimes car batteries run out during the night, which reduces their working hours and family well-being. After getting good recommendations from neighbors that use solar home systems, Bav decided to apply for a KIVA loan to buy a solar home system.

He helps them with the household chores and also helps to care for his 5 year-old sister and a 16 year-old brother who is autistic.\r\n\r\nHe is studying Industrial Mechatronics because he likes to create, innovate, and improve. He likes mechanics, electronics, robotics, and information systems; the branch of study that he has chosen has everything he likes. He has been studying for one year and he still has 2 years left to finish. He really likes the course of studies he has chosen, he enjoys very much what they are teaching, and this is reflected in his grades.\r\n\r\nHe feels that through this course of study, his family will be able to benefit. He desires to improve his quality of life, help out with the household expenses, help his family with his little sister\u2019s studies, and eventually start his own business \u2013 automatic devices for optimizing time use. \r\n\r\nThe only obstacle that he currently faces is his family\u2019s economic situation. For this reason, he is requesting a recurrent loan from Kiva, so that he won\u2019t have to quit studying what he loves so much. His greatest hope is that when he finishes studying he will get credit in the university so that he can take advantage of his youth to continue studying. He plans to work at a big business or start his own business where he can work with everything that he will have learned.\r\n\r\nWith this loan he will help his mother, who is in charge of the expenses. This would make her feel relieved, knowing that he\u2019ll be able to continue with his studies. He will be better prepared and ready for all kinds of work challenges. Jean Pierre is very happy, calmer, knowing that he will be able to study, which is his greatest wish.\r\n\r\nHis greatest dreams in life are to work and alternate that with more studying, to buy a house for his family, to create great big machines for prestigious companies, and to be the best in his profession.\r\n\r\nHis biggest challenge is the economic factor. In addition to this is the problem he had after finishing middle school and he had so many dreams. He wanted to study lots of things, to the point where he didn\u2019t know where to start. Now he knows his path, and he found it at SENATI, taking the course of study that he enjoys so much.\r\n\r\nJean Pierre feels very grateful to the people who will support him because, thanks to them and to this program, he will achieve his dream and be an excellent professional. \r\n\r\nLastly, Jean Pierre wants to give a message: \u201cI am very grateful for the wonderful support, and please continue supporting other young people like me of scarce economic resources. Thank you very much Kiva!\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":293.45,"image":{"id":1906806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for his tuition fees to study Industrial Mechatronics, so that he can eventually have his own business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":358,"posted_date":"2015-06-28T22:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-28T22:10:11Z","loan_amount":4625,"lender_count":159,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jean Pierre David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4625,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":44,"loan_amount":4625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.58,"local_amount":72.58,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":72.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696582563},{"amount":73.1,"local_amount":73.1,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":73.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711500459},{"amount":73.32,"local_amount":73.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":73.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731018272},{"amount":74.45,"local_amount":74.45,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-01T13:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":74.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752106603}],"funded_date":"2015-07-09T14:40:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":902727,"name":"Pablo Francisco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pablo es un peque\u00f1o productor de caf\u00e9 en el departamento de Jinotega.

Gabriela wants to start her own publishing company to be able to support her family. Right now, she is in the second year of her degree and she still has two more years to go. She is doing very well in her studies and for that reason does not want to drop out. However, the biggest obstacle for her family is financial, as they are having money troubles right now. Gabriela hopes to work at a publishing company or another design company when she finishes her studies. She came to Kiva to request a loan, which she will use to pay off her debts from the second academic semester. Obtaining this loan will put her mind at ease about the payments. She is very happy to have received the loan, because in this way she will be able to continue her degree. Her biggest dream is to become a cartoonist, writer and a successful professional. Another of her dreams is for the people who see her drawings to be able to realize that they can do whatever they want, without being scared of what people say. Gabriela wants to say the following to Kiva: \"Thank you for what you are doing for thousands of people, including me, because you are helping students that really want to succeed to fulfill their dreams and goals.\""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":399.02,"image":{"id":1906836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for her graphic design degree..

She is married, and has raised and given a good upbringing to 5 children, the youngest of which is 23 years old. Sairahan has a secondary education, and she is a very responsible, honest, and hard-working woman. Sairahan and her husband are on pensions, and they also have worked in animal husbandry and field husbandry for many years. \r\n\r\nIn April 2015, Sairahan applied to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy fertilizer, and melon and watermelon seedlings to grow. She used the funds as described, and has been paying back the loan on time. However, in May of this year, a misfortune occurred: 1.0 hectares of land, already planted with watermelon, were damaged by strong thunderstorms, pouring rain and mud flows. They did not manage to save the harvest.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sairahan still has time to fertilize the soil, plant new seedlings, and have a good harvest in the fall. There are also 2 cows on her farm.

her business. Although there were some challenges in collecting her receivables she is still encouraged by the good turnout of her sales as it really provides for the educational expenses of her children and meeting their daily needs.\r\n\r\nShe is hopeful that she can still request a PHP 10,000 loan to buy more frozen processed meat of a greater variety such as marinated pork and beef, hot dogs, bacon, rice and charcoal as well as to fill the regular orders of her customers. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial aid and for your good heart.

He is the happy father of two children - a son and a daughter.  Tagaymurod is 28 years old and works as a salesman.  Tagaymurod has a counter at the local market at which he sells watermelon, fruits, and vegetables.  He loves his work and enjoys every day of his life.  You could call him the most positive salesman at the market.  It is impossible to walk by his smile and not want to purchase something.  Tagaymurod sends each of his clients off with a good mood and a dazzling smile.  Tagaymurod decided to purchase more watermelons to sell because this is the watermelon and melon season.  His capital does not allow him to solve his problem on his own, and so he needs to rely on borrowed funds.  Tagayrumod will bring watermelons and in this way will attract a large number of clients.  He hopes that, thanks to you, his plan will be realized, and expresses his gratitude in

Many of the residents of the town work in businesses like horticulture and crop production.  But our heroine Dilrabokhon chose a different business.  She loves animals and started a business raising cattle, and now works alone in a cattle barn.  Because her husband could not find work in his native country, he went abroad for work.  Dilrabokhon has been successful on her own and plans to expand her business.  She is requesting borrowed funds in order to purchase a pair of calves and increase the size of her herd.

This will allow her to become an agent for Ruma\u2019s layaway product called 'Mapan,' designed for lower income communities. Mapan enables customers to save up, little by little, by depositing change at agents like Kristiani and as their balance grows, it allows customers to make major asset purchases like housewares, appliances, and school supplies for their children. \r\n\r\nAs a Mapan agent, Kristiani is responsible for processing deposits from customers into their Mapan accounts as well as receiving orders from customers who want to buy products listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer orders, Kristiani will submit the order via SMS and, within 5-10 days, the product will be delivered to the customer. With Mapan, Kristiani believes that her community will be able to have access to higher quality products with lower prices. \r\n\r\nIn the photo, Kristiani is shown holding Mapan's poster.

This is the reason why he is asking for a loan so he can carry out the planting in time.\r\n\r\nJuan hopes to be able to get the loan in order to improve his income and build his house for his family's comfort."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175.43,"image":{"id":1907085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy coffee seedlings and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2015-06-29T10:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-29T10:40:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.84,"local_amount":334,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":335.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696477852},{"amount":43.78,"local_amount":333.59,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:20:40Z","rounded_local_amount":335.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711385509},{"amount":43.84,"local_amount":334,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":335.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731215595},{"amount":43.97,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":336.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752001079}],"funded_date":"2015-07-02T22:23:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":902888,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2466.68,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones","Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy different articles of clothing and shoes.
