Her monthly savings are just 2,000 INR. \r\n\r\nHence, Kaliben thought of starting her own business to supplement the family's income. She started a small animal husbandry business in her backyard. With this business she is currently earning 5,000 INR, but she wants to earn more to support her children's education. \r\n\r\nShe came up with the idea of getting a loan to expand her business. She got together with four other women who share similar interests. The other women are determined to help their families and want to expand their existing businesses as well. These families earn on average 10,000 INR per month, out of which they are able to save only 2,000 INR. \r\n\r\nSimilar to Kaliben, the other women pursue small businesses. Together, the group seeks a loan of 50,000 INR. They will use the loan to expand their business. Your loan will help these women earn more and give a good education to their children.

","en":"Khalifabibi is from the warmest place in the Republic of Tajikistan. She lives in Jilikul with her husband. Her sons are away working in the Russian Federation and they send money home to their parents each month. Her children are caring and hard-working like Khalifabibi. Khalifabibi is very happy that she has such sons. Using the money that her sons send, Khalifabibi spends it on food and other expenses. Every year she wants to renovate her house, but she is not able to save up the necessary sum for the renovations. Because of Khalifabibi's lack of funds she has decided to take a loan and renovate her house. The requested loan will help her to renovate the house and improve her living

It has drinking water and electricity, and is connected to the sewer system.\r\nShe sells second-hand clothing such as trousers, T-shirts, shirts, tops, jeans, etc.\r\nMaria peddles her wares door-to-door every day of the week. She says that her merchandise, being second-hand, is accessible to all and sells very well.

30-year-old seamstress from the Rudaki district of Tajikistan.  The residents of this district are known for their skills, intelligence, honesty, dynamism and punctuality.  Zulayho is married and the mother of five beautiful and amazing children.  Her husband works as a taxi driver, taking people from place to place.  Zulayho herself works as a seamstress, from home.  She makes her own money and helps her husband provide for the children.  \r\n\r\nZulayho currently has one sewing machine which happens to be her main source of income.

Her business is selling accessories for cell phones.\r\n\r\nAngelica is a good mother, enterprising, active, constant, patient, responsible and very hard-working. She is developing her business in the El Torno neighborhood that in recent years, has experienced a large demographic rate of growth due to the emigration of population from the country's interior. The climate is temperate, located as it is among 'meso-thermal' plains and valleys, though there are strong winds and torrential rains at certain times of the year.    \r\n\r\nAngelica has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair fastened at the back of her neck, a short stature, and a robust physical appearance. Her mother tongue is Guarani which she speaks in the family, but speaks Spanish in the general culture and in her business. (She is wearing a blue blouse in the photo.) Angelica lives with her husband. who works as a driver, and with her children. The eldest has finished school, while the middle child is in school, and the youngest is still in her care. They live in a rented room constructed of wood with a calamine roof and dirt floor that has electricity and well water extracted by a pump. \r\n\r\nThe need to improve her business in order to cover family expenses led Angelina to lead a community bank composed of members with businesses such as selling meals, second-hand clothing, dairy products, vegetables, soft drinks, stuffed breads, and cheese. All are requesting loans in hopes of improving their incomes. Angela's business sells accessories for cell phones, including cases, batteries, hearing devices, and other \u201citems on foot in markets and fairs. The merchandise rotates constantly and must be repeatedly renewed...\u201d she says. The advantage of her business is that products rotate continuously. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to invest in purchasing new merchandise. \r\n\r\nAngela's dream is to open a store and cease the need to sell on foot. She wants to offer a larger variety of cell phone accessories, and with the benefits, cover her children's expenses. This is her first loan cycle with our institution during her 3 years in this activity.\r\n\r\nThese are Angelina's motives for soliciting a loan \u2013 to purchase cell phone accessories in order to improve her offerings and be able to pay for the costs incurred in raising her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1905701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more accessories for cell phones, improving her inventory, in order to cover expenses incurred for her children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-29T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-29T16:20:01Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nalberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faviola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reina                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-18T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":17500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T04:00:00Z","amount":2662.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T04:00:00Z","amount":2759.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":2860.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T04:00:00Z","amount":2964.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T04:00:00Z","amount":3072.36},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T04:00:00Z","amount":3180.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":388.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":402.15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":463.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":790.18,"local_amount":5422.83,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5436.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554871},{"amount":416.79,"local_amount":2860.34,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2867.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468956},{"amount":431.97,"local_amount":2964.46,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2971.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296789},{"amount":911.06,"local_amount":6252.37,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:06Z","rounded_local_amount":6267.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076943}],"funded_date":"2015-07-14T10:38:48Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":908042,"name":"Kristine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kristine is a 27-year-old mother of a young son.

She has three children aged 5, 9 and 14 years old. Her business is the sales of snacks and a neighborhood store.<br \/><br \/>She is a good mother enterprising, dedicated, patient, optimistic, responsible and very hard-working. Her business is in the \u2018Plan 3000\u2019 area which is located to the south of the city within the semi-urban area. It was created because of a flood which left over 3,000 families homeless and with the few possessions left them they settled on this barren land and had to start their lives over. <br \/><br \/>Tomasa is dark-skinned, has dark eyes, long black hair that she ties back, is short and physically robust. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks with her family and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and for her business. (In the photo she is the first to the right, wearing a white blouse with blue stripes). <br \/><br \/>She shares her life with her partner who works as a farmer and her children. The oldest study in school and the youngest is starting kindergarten. They live in a room that they built themselves made of wood with a metal roof and dirt floor with water from a well, electricity and no sewage. <br \/><br \/>Her desire to get ahead to pay the pre-school fees of her youngest child led her to head a group of people with businesses like: selling second hand clothing, a construction service, raising cattle, selling oranges, selling meat, selling meals, ceramic handicrafts and a fruit and vegetable shop, to request a loan to improve their businesses. <br \/><br \/>Her business is selling snacks and a neighborhood store. Her snacks are sandwiches made with bread and some kind of meat with some vegetable added to it. She sells them daily in her store located in her house. \"I prepare snacks and go out and sell them intinerantly and I leave others in my store where they also sell them\", she commented. The advantage of her business is that she sells them both in the street and in her store and her disadvantage is the lack of capital to invest in her business to generate more income. Her dream is to expand her business and stock her store to improve her sales. <br \/><br \/>This is her first loan with the institution in the 3 years she has had her business. For these reasons she is requesting a loan to buy ingredients to make snacks and sell them in her neighborhood store to improve her sales and pay the educational expenses of her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3575,"image":{"id":1907782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to make snacks and sell them in her neighborhood store to improve her sales and pay the educational expenses of her children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-29T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-29T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":3575,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Walter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aleja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-18T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":24500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-12T04:00:00Z","amount":3805.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":3848.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T04:00:00Z","amount":3988.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T04:00:00Z","amount":4133.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T04:00:00Z","amount":4284.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T04:00:00Z","amount":4440.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":555.28},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":561.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":603.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625.13},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":647.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1116.83,"local_amount":7653.78,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":7683.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554872},{"amount":581.99,"local_amount":3988.46,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4003.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468957},{"amount":603.17,"local_amount":4133.64,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4149.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296790},{"amount":1273.01,"local_amount":8724.12,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:06Z","rounded_local_amount":8758.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076944}],"funded_date":"2015-06-30T10:18:39Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":903435,"name":"Padre Eterno Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cKUTIMUY\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

This is a very exciting time for the eleven women who are members of the group that is located in Chichicastenango, a fertile area that has orchards of peaches, plums and apples. \r\n\r\nJuana is a member of the group who is a single mother with one daughter. She was only able to attend school until the 4th grade. In spite of this, she is determined to be a successful businesswoman and provide for her daughter.  Juana has a traditional textile business and creates beautiful blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d as well as woven tube skirts called \u201ccortes\u201d.\r\n\r\nEach week, she delivers 5-7 \u201ccortes\u201d to be sold. Actually, she is quite familiar with the traditional textile business as she started as a child. Juana is requesting a loan that she plans to use to buy high quality thread in various colors and additional \u201ccortes\u201d that she can offer her clients. Her goal is to have a solid clientele that she can consistently sell her textiles to.\r\n\r\nNearly 80% have their children between the ages of 7-13 enrolled in school. At their monthly meetings, a Facilitator from Friendship Bridge shares useful information with the women about everyday subjects like nutrition, health, and self-esteem. The ladies learn to effectively manage their small loans as they learn about budgeting, marketing and customer service. The Facilitator shares this teaching time with the women speaking their own indigenous language and uses drawings, pictures and games. \r\n\r\nKiva investors are valuable partners in this effort. We look forward to providing a follow-up report soon on Juana and her hard-working friends in the Trust Bank \u201cLas Trabajadoras\u201d.

These ten women are very excited because they have successfully completed their first KIiva loan cycle.  Thanks to the generous support of Kiva investors one year ago, they were able to receive their first loan which helped expand their small businesses and provided extra income to support their families.  Since they were so successful in their first loan cycle, they are now asking for a second loan cycle in order to expand their businesses even more. \r\n\r\n One of the members of \u201cTierra de los Duraznos\u201d is Pascuala who was elected Secretary for the new loan cycle.  She is a single woman but has the responsibility of providing income for her home and family of five including her parents.   Pascuala has a textile business and sells the typical clothing of the area including blouses (huipiles), belts (fajas) and wrap-around skirts (cortes) that are worn in Western Guatemala.  She buys and sells the clothing from the areas surrounding Chichicastenango.  She also makes some of the clothing.  Since the demand for her clothing is so great, she has employed 10 other people who do piece work and in this way, helps these ten people support their families!  She pays them per piece.  Pascuala is asking for new loan in order to buy thread in bulk because this lowers the initial cost of making the piece, thus, increasing her profit.\r\n\r\nPascuala shares her feelings about the loan: \u201cThanks to my loan, I have been able to generate extra income that has permitted my family and me to cover the costs of our basic needs and has made it possible for us to look forward to a better quality of life!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe ten women of \u201cTierra de los Duraznos\u201d are very grateful to Kiva investors for showing new confidence in them and helping them to develop their small businesses.

in her yard at home. She has been engaged in this business for over two years.\r\n\r\nSaida lives in the Shahrituz region together with her mother-in-law, father-in-law and son. Her father-in-law is 73 years old. Her mother-in-law is 65 years old. Her husband is 28, and her son is 6. For the animal business, Saida rears cattle on her own. Her husband is away working far from the family.

a young businessman from the city of Tursun-zoda. He is 21 years old. Three years ago he started a livestock breeding business. From his very childhood, Olimjon was a responsible person and always wanted to be independent and have financial stability. \r\n\r\nAs finding work was very difficult in Olimjon's region, and as most people worked with agriculture, he did not question his choice of business. He started working with livestock breeding, just like his neighbors and his fellow villagers. However, he was sure that his business would thrive more and be better than the others, because he puts more effort into his work. \r\n\r\nOlimjon picked up a lot of experience in this area in three years, and decided that it was time to expand the business. For the loan amount he will purchase some livestock and livestock feed for them. Olimjon is confident in his success, and success is definitely awaiting him."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":138.91,"image":{"id":1914382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase some livestock and feed for them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursun-zoda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-06-29T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-29T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olimjon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":190.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":210.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":211.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":220.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":233.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":242.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":250.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":261.55},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":275.95},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":284.49},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":297.49},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":320.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.49},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.59},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.99},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.42},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.74,"local_amount":190.44,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:27:34Z","rounded_local_amount":198.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696610268},{"amount":35.08,"local_amount":210.5,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":219.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711526289},{"amount":35.29,"local_amount":211.74,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":220.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731042057},{"amount":36.8,"local_amount":220.81,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":230.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752131022}],"funded_date":"2015-07-28T22:05:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":908451,"name":"Concepcion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Concepcion has a collection of ornamental garden plants.

The members of the group have an average age of 41 years with a majority not being able to read nor write.  However, they all want to better themselves through their small businesses and their monthly educational trainings.\r\n\r\nThis is the case of Josefa who is 48 years old.  She is looking for a way to get a more prosperous future for her family and provide the opportunities for her four children to have an education. Josefa saw that the income of her husband, who is a day laborer, was not enought to cover the expenses of their home and family. \r\n\r\nShe decided to begin a textile business making the clothing that is typical of Chichicastenango.  She also began an animal husbandry business and currently, two bulls are being fattened for market.  In order for her business to grow, Josefa is requesting a loan that she hopes will be funded by Kiva investors.  With the largest percentage of the loan, Josefa will buy a variety of quality threads for her textile business. A smaller percentage will be used to buy food to continue fattening her bulls so that she can sell them.\r\n \r\nBesides the loan, Josefa and her friends in the Trust Bank have monthly meetings with a Friendship Bridge Facilitator who gives educational trainings on a variety of useful subjects. The women of \u201cMujeres Sembradoras\u201d have the opportunity to learn about a variety of topics like women\u2019s and children\u2019s health, self-esteem, women\u2019s empowerment, business management and customer relations.

Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 7 a\u00f1os que desarrolla esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Julia solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la reparaci\u00f3n de su carrito juguero para poder continuar con su actividad y alimentar a su familia.\n","en":"Julia is a 29 year-old woman who lives with her partner, has a 1 year-old son, and has a business of selling hot drinks combined with grains and milk. She is a good mother, enterprising, patient, steady, committed, responsible and very hard-working. \r\n\r\nHer business is located in the 'Villa de Carmen' area, an area that grew due to the existence of spring water. In this area, there are large plantations of Kishuara trees, which were planted by the settlers, and currently some are maintained as a remembrance. The area has a cold, dry climate with a temperature that varies between 0 and 12 degrees Celsius during the day. \r\n\r\nJulia has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair that she wears in a braid, short stature, thin physique and wears traditional clothing (hat, shawl and skirt). Her native tongue is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish outside of the home and for her business. She shares her life with her partner, who works in construction, and with her son who is not yet school-age. They live in their own home constructed of brick and cement, with a tin roof and wooden floors, that has potable water, electricity, gas and a sewage system.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling hot drinks, such as: quinoa with milk, quinoa with apple, ca\u00f1ahua [a grain similar to quinoa] with milk or apple, and others. \"I work from very early in the morning because my customers are the first to see the sun,\" she says. The advantage of her business is that the hot drinks are in great demand due to the cold, the disadvantage is that her cart is in poor condition and does not provide the necessary help to her work. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to open a store and stop peddling. She wants to repair her cart because the tires are destroyed and the rings are broken. This is the 1st sequence of loans with the institution in 7 years that she has had this business. It is for these reasons that Julia is requesting a loan for the reparation of her cart in order to continue with her work and feed her family.

But if there is only one or two family members present for dinner, they would prefer to buy cooked viand or food. This is a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. This is the reason why Herlen\u2019s carenderia business is considered valuable. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community, students, and working people. \r\n\r\nHerlen is 48 years old, married to a cook named Ricardo, and is blessed with children. They are living in Santa Barbara, Iloilo where Helen runs a carenderia and her husband does the cooking. For almost sixteen years, this has been the source of their family income. Although the canteen business is quite exhausting since they have to wake up very early and go to sleep late at night, the couple persists because it helps provide for their daily expenses and children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nBut the presence of other carenderias threatens Herlen\u2019s business. She needs to improve hers through additional capital of PHP 18,000 that she will use to buy more ingredients like meat, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She has to work hard in order to support their children\u2019s education until its completion. With a college diploma, she believes that her children will have a brighter future.

Rene personally sells the catch from her fishing boat in nearby municipalities.  She has been a member of Paglaum MPC in good standing for almost five years. She wants to obtain financial assistance from Paglaum MPC amounting to PHP 10,000 for the purchase of new fishing nets.  As much as possible, she has to have quality fishing accessories to maximize the chances of a good catch. She already has floaters to help guard her fish cages.

She and her husband both work to provide for their daily needs and the school needs of their daughter.\r\n\r\nBercy has operated a small variety store for six years already. She does not allow poverty in the Philippines to hinder them from improving in life. Aside from her small store she ventures into various other businesses such as selling snacks, RTW clothes and retailing electronic loads of different pre-paid mobile subscribers to earn additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of Php 900 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store, Bercy is requesting a Php 30000 loan to buy grocery items such as canned goods, coffee, eggs, instant noodles, beverages etc. Part of the loan she will use to pay for ingredients of her snack items, RTW clothes and electronic loads.

Almost all businesses in those areas were destroyed. Entrepreneurs have worked hard for nearly two years to recover and rehabilitate their businesses. Sari-sari (variety) stores were not exempt from that crisis. Frequent distribution of relief goods to Haiyan victims affected communities by almost crushing the variety stores. The commodities that the people need everyday were supplied to them through relief goods instead of sari-sari stores. It was several months after Haiyan that variety stores rose again. \r\n\r\nGemma is one of those variety store owners. Not only did Haiyan affect her business. Her income also diminishes during school breaks or vacations. It\u2019s good that she also owns a tricycle driven by her husband, Norly, which provides supplemental income for the family. Now that school has begun, she needs more variety store items like snacks, toiletries and beverages. She also plans to pay the last installment on their tricycle, so that income can totally be used for her family\u2019s needs and savings. She asks for your kind support to fund a loan in the amount of PHP 30,000. May you be God\u2019s blessing to her as she aspires to improve her business.\r\n\r\nGemma is a devoted member of CCT Credit Cooperative and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":590.64,"image":{"id":1914358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more snacks, toiletries, beverages, and other items for her variety store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tigbauan, Iloilo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-29T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-29T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gemma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":225.04,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":10154.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523480},{"amount":112.52,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5077.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433909},{"amount":140.6,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6346.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954828},{"amount":112.48,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5077.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044710}],"funded_date":"2015-07-01T03:45:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":908501,"name":"Angelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angelita is a widow, 53 years old, with eight children.

She has remained a widow since her husband died and has dedicated herself to taking care of her only offspring, who is a special child, now age 40. Raising her special child has been her biggest challenge, but with her strong faith in God she has been able to surmount this trial in her life.\r\n\r\nVirginia is grateful that God has blessed her with a general store and eatery business for ten years already. It has been her stable source of income to support herself and her special child's daily needs.  She buys essential food items from a wholesaler, such as canned goods, coffee, biscuits, beverages, and toiletries and sells them at retail prices. Aside from her small store, she also has a small eatery that sells simple snacks. At times her income is quite low, but being a positive woman, she is able to persevere and carry on her business with joy in her heart. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand operations of her store she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan, which she will use to buy large quantities of grocery items to add to her store. Part of the loan she will use to buy ingredients like fresh meat, vegetables, and condiments to cook meals for her small eatery. She is thanking God and you in advance for your good heart and the financial aid that will be given her. Her earnings are a big help to cover her and her son's daily sustenance. \r\n\r\nVirginia hopes to still grow and expand her store. She prays that God will continue to bless her with good health and long life so she can continue to look after her special child. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God.\r\n\r\n *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":984.38,"image":{"id":1915363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-06-29T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-29T23:50:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375.04,"local_amount":16666.64,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:10Z","rounded_local_amount":16924.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523490},{"amount":187.51,"local_amount":8333.32,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":8462.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433919},{"amount":234.35,"local_amount":10416.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":10577.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954838},{"amount":187.48,"local_amount":8333.32,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":8462.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044714}],"funded_date":"2015-07-02T18:35:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Schindler Marlow","image":null}},{"id":908539,"name":"Shabnamgul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shabnamgul is a responsible woman.

This season is difficult for fishermen and fish vendors. Practically, it\u2019s dangerous for fishermen to go fishing. The scarcity of fish makes the price higher, and the fish vendors find it hard to afford. \r\n\r\nJose, 69, is a dried fish vendor who resides in Tigbauan, Iloilo. He also owns a variety store that sells usual commodities like canned goods, snacks, toiletries, condiments, and many others. He decided to run a variety store, because dried fish vending is unstable especially during rainy season. Now he wants to prepare for the upcoming rainy days. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting additional capital of PHP 25,000 to buy a volume quantity of fresh fish while it\u2019s still cheap. He will dry it and sell it afterwards. This additional capital will keep his dried fish business running, even during rainy season. He will also use part of the loan to buy more supplies for his variety store. You can be the answer to his prayers through your generous support. Thank you so much in advance.\r\n\r\nJose is married to Merna and they have children who are still studying in college. Two or three years from now, he will be relieved of his children\u2019s educational expenses. He can give full focus to his dream of improving his business. He is an enthusiastic member of CCT where he gains inspiration from his co-fellowship* members who regularly meet once a week to study the Word of God and share stories of their life and businesses. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Microfinance

Unlike other foreign countries who are only used to eating breads for lunch or dinner, most Filipinos can\u2019t afford to not eat rice with dishes during lunches and dinners.

This is the reason why perhaps Rosalie has chosen to manage a food stall then. Since food is always in demand, she earns well profit from this. \r\n\r\nHowever, Rosalie still wants to expand her business. She is asking a loan worth PHP 10 000. She will use this to buy more quantity of raw ingredients needed for her recipes. She wants to send you her sincerest thanks for your goodness and generosity by now. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she wants her family to experience progress and improve as well in her current business.

Wherever there is a cellphone signal, there\u2019s an e-loading business. This is due to the fact that most cellphone owners use a prepaid plan and only a few subscribe to a postpaid plan. In a prepaid arrangement, a person can budget his load usage because he can buy as little as a 10-peso load.\r\n\r\nRamon, a 61-year-old widower from Barotac Viejo, Iloilo, was encouraged to enter this e-loading business just recently. He has been driving a tricycle for nine years but his income doesn\u2019t suffice especially when passengers are few. Aside from this, he\u2019s already getting old and there are times when he cannot drive. Hence, he started this load retailing. In this way he can earn extra income while waiting for passengers or even at home. He knocks at your kind hearts for a loan worth PHP 8,000, which he can use partly to buy a load wallet and partly to pay for his tricycle maintenance. This loan will give him supplementary income for his everyday needs and some savings for the future. \r\n\r\nHe is committed to CCT\u2019s vision to alleviate poverty and he regularly meets with his co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of his life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her business is the sale of weather strips and plush cloth.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, enterprising, independent, active, consistent, responsible, and hard-working.  Her business is located in the southern region of the city, characterized by its intense economic activity and the establishment of the biggest markets with innumerable galleries and local markets.  It is a warm, sub-tropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 21-35 degrees Celsius.  \r\n\r\nMaria has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair that she wears tied behind the neck, short stature, and robust physical constitution.  Her mother tongue is Guarani, which she speaks with her family.  She also speaks Spanish for cultural and business reasons.  In the picture, she is the second from the left, wearing a light blue long-sleeved blouse and blue jeans.  She shares her life with her son who is in school.  They live in a rented room made of brick and cement with a tin roof and cement floor.  They have drinkable water, electricity, and a sewage system.  The necessity to improve her business brought her to lead a communal bank made up of people whose businesses include: transportation services, a welding workshop, a video store, tea service, and sales of flatware, cell phones, chickens, and flowers.  The group's purpose is to request a loan and expand their businesses.  \r\n\r\nHer business is the sale of weather strips and plush cloth.  The weather strips are adhesive tapes that are placed on the windows to protect from drafts, dust, and noise from the exterior.  \"The weather strips are to isolate the air and the cold, they help keep the air from entering or leaving the house, cooling the air inside,\" she says.  The advantage of her business is that she has ongoing customers; the disadvantage is the lack of capital to invest in her business.  Her dream is to open a stall.  She wants to purchase weather strips at wholesale to offer more to her customers.  This is the third cycle of loans with the institution in the years that she has developed this activity.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Maria requests a loan for the purchase of weather strips at wholesale, to offer greater quantity and to pay school fees for her son.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3428.59,"image":{"id":1907981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase weather strips at wholesale in order to offer greater quantity and to pay school fees for her son.
