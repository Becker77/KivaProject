Moreover, they have no fresh water to survive her farming life, so she decided to take a Kiva loan via VisionFund to buy a water filter for her family\u2019s use. She hopes to improve her family\u2019s living conditions and health.

For many, this stems from the 30 year civil war that ended in 1996 and for others, it is because they grew up feeling not valued and had no self-esteem.  Friendship Bridge with its \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program, combining small loans and education, is making a difference in the lives of over 22,000 indigenous women who are empowering themselves and learning to value themselves as well.\r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMujeres de Chuanoj\u201d is composed of eleven ladies who live in rural \u201cAldea Chuanoj\u201d in Guatemala. The people in this area speak the indigenous  Mayan native language of Kiche. The majority of women have traditional textile businesses and create ornate blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d. Others buy and sell traditional woven tube skirts call \u201ccortes\u201d.\r\n\r\nYesica, a young 19 year old member of the group, was elected President, a role that she responsibly carries out with great care. She has a young 3 year old daughter. Yesica has her own textile business and buys and sells traditional \u201chuipiles\u201d and \u201ccortes\u201d  as well as belts or \u201cfajas\u201d and aprons or \u201cdelantales\u201d. She is quite happy with her business and is pleased that her family helps her to distribute her textiles to various parts of the country. She is requesting a loan that she will use to buy adornments to decorate her \u201chuipiles\u201d and \u201cdelantles\u201d that are worn in the community.\r\n\r\nAt the monthly meetings of the Trust Bank, a Friendship Bridge Facilitator shares relevant information through role playing, drawings and pictures with the ladies. They acquire valuable business tools learning about budgeting, accounting and marketing. \r\n\r\nThank you, KIVA investors, for taking the time to learn about Yesica and her friends in the \u201cMujeres de Chuanoj\u201d Trust Bank. With their loans and education, they are poised to step into a brighter future, benefitting themselves, their families and their community! We are cheering them on to success!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1743,"image":{"id":1911675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy adornments to decorate her traditional  \u201chuipiles\u201d and \u201cdelantles\u201d that are worn in the community.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Totonicapan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -91.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-06-30T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-30T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":5225,"lender_count":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Cecilia Evarista ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesica Marleny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonioa Florinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":39800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":5225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3319.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3319.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3319.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3319.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3319.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3319.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3319.2},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3319.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3319.2},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3319.2},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3319.2},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3288.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":435.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":435.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":435.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":435.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.75},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.75},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.75},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.75},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":435.75,"local_amount":3319.2,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3320.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696557507},{"amount":435.75,"local_amount":3319.2,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3320.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711472467},{"amount":435.75,"local_amount":3319.2,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3320.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730991553},{"amount":435.75,"local_amount":3319.2,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3320.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752079822}],"funded_date":"2015-07-28T04:57:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":908675,"name":"Rowena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rowena comes from Silang, Cavite, Philippines.

Although there are other general store around her area she is still glad and thankful with the good turnout of her store as it really helps meet her family's everyday needs and school needs of her children.

She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. She values her store so much since it is where she gets the funds to support her children's school needs.\r\n\r\nRowena aims to sustain and grow her small store into a big grocery store. Her simple dream is to see all her children go to college. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Juana has an animal husbandry business and raises cows and bulls. She sells four or five liters of fresh milk every day to her clients. It is a family business and before going to school, her children distribute the milk. The business is successful and for this reason, Juana is requesting a loan to buy vitamins for her cows and to purchase another bull. She will use another part of her loan to buy feed and antiparasitic medicines. She also wants to rent pasture with enough grasses so that her animals can be well fed.\r\n\r\nAt the monthly meetings, a Facilitator from Friendship Bridge shares useful information with the ladies about the world around them and within them. Using games, role playing and drawings, the women learn about taking better care of themselves and their families as they gain knowledge about nutrition, health, the use of medicinal plants and hygiene. \r\n\r\nThe success of Friendship Bridge is based on the growth of these women as individuals and businesswomen to become agents of change in their families and communities.

province in Cambodia. She has cultivated rice to support her family since 2000. Her husband is 41 years old and also a rice farmer. Among her five children, one works in a factory, two work for a food store and the last two are in school.

She has a specialized secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which constitutes the main source of income for her family.  She started in this business five years ago with an initial capital of 20,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has four cows and 15 sheep on her farm.

The members and their businesses are: Gloria, who sells woven chairs; Guillermina, clothing and cosmetics; Juan, who runs a motorcycle workshop; and iv\u00e1n, a workshop mechanic. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing high school, Juan began to work as a taxi driver to help his parents with the family expenses. Nevertheless, he always had the goal of having his own business, and five years ago he finally achieved this, opening his motorcycle workshop, this time to provide for his own family: his wife Teresa and their two little ones. \"There is nothing better than having my own business and being my own boss.\"\r\n\r\nHis passion for motorcycles was what brought Juan to choose this business. He learned to repair motorcycles simply by adjusting his own, and little by little learning a little more. The workshop is located near a technical institute, which gives him an advantage, since the majority of the students and even the residents of the city have motorcycles. In addition, Juan's efforts have also helped him to have a stable business. He offers his services from 7 in the morning until 8 at night, in general, although he also services special cases. \"If some customer needs service after 8 at night, I come to his aid to offer it.\"\r\n\r\nWith the earnings from the business, Juan covers the household expenses, pays the rent of the space where he has the workshop, and reinvests in materials and tools such as oil, spark plugs, tubes, and headlights, since these are the parts that he changes with greatest frequency. He will use the new loan to purchase keys, oil, a gauge, and mirrors to continue with his business. Among his goals are to employ an assistant and to open another workshop.\r\n\r\nThe Luna group remains strong and united, in spite of the obstacles they experienced several loan cycles ago. They are all grateful for the support that they have received through the loans.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken at the house of Se\u00f1ora Gloria, who makes woven chairs, and some of her products can be seen.

Together with his wife, he started sewing clothing four years ago.  They took advantage of her family's knowledge, and while she studied fashion design and designed clothing, her mother sewed the clothing and they later sold it.  With the profits from this activity, they slowly began acquiring sewing machines, and they now have three employees who work on contracts to assemble clothing either by sewing or assembling products with pieces made by third parties.  \r\n\r\nAntonio has a lot of new ideas in his head so they can stop taking assembly work and start making their own designs.

The average monthly income of the family is 500 GEL. It is hardly enough for food for a four member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category.
