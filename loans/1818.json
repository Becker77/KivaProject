She is enterprising, independent, understanding, patient, responsible, and very hard-working.  She operates her business in the zone 'Plan 3000'3000', which is known for its multicultural inhabitants (Aymar\u00e1s, Quechuas and Guaran\u00edes), and is located in the southern part of the city.  Migrants have taken over this area and have formed businesses that are constantly growing.  The climate is warm and tropical with temperatures that range between 21 and 35 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nYusara is dark-skinned with brown eyes and long brown hair that she wears tied up behind her neck.  She is short with a robust physical complexion.  Her native language is Guarani, which she speaks with her family and she speaks Spanish with the general population and in her business.  (She is seated in the center wearing a light blue blouse.)\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her husband who works in transportation and they live in a rented room, constructed of brick and cement with a metal roof and cement floor.  They have running water, electricity, and sewage.  \r\n\r\nThe need to improve her business led her to lead a group of lenders with businesses such as: food sales, TV repairs, natural medicine sales, snack sales, fruit sales, ceramic crafts, and breakfast sales, in order to request a loan and improve their businesses.\r\n\r\nHer business is manicures, which deals with the care and beautification of hands and the special care and painting of fingernails.  She works independently in beauty centers and hair salons.  Among her tasks are cutting, cleaning, and polishing her customer's fingernails as well as toenails.  She explains, \"First, I remove any previous polish using acetone or a similar solution.  Then, I cut and shape the nails using clippers and nail files...\"\r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she constantly has customers, but the disadvantage is the lack of capital to purchase work materials such as: basins, liquid soap, wooden files, nail files, nail polish, buffers, polishers, cuticle remover, nail clippers, cotton, polish remover, cuticle cutters, hydrating cuticle cream, base polish, enamel, drying spray, hydrating cream for hands, clean towels, sterilizers and others.  Her dream is to open her own beauty salon and she wants to purchase these manicure materials to continue with her work.\r\n\r\nThis is the first in a series of loans with the organization in the three years since she has developed this career.  It is for these motives that Yusara is requesting a loan to purchase manicure materials to continue her work and open a beauty salon."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2906.11,"image":{"id":1908974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase materials for manicures to continue working and to open a beauty salon.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-30T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-30T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":3200,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yusara Russen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yenny Fer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesika Romane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grovert Seberino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-19T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-02T04:00:00Z","amount":1656.99},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T04:00:00Z","amount":1687.15},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T04:00:00Z","amount":1717.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T04:00:00Z","amount":1749.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T04:00:00Z","amount":1780.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T04:00:00Z","amount":1813.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T04:00:00Z","amount":1846.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T04:00:00Z","amount":1879.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T04:00:00Z","amount":1914.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T04:00:00Z","amount":1949.02},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T04:00:00Z","amount":1984.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T04:00:00Z","amount":2020.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":259.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.76},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":273.45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.43},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":288.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":293.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1249.76,"local_amount":8592.08,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":8622.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554879},{"amount":532.32,"local_amount":3659.74,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3672.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468963},{"amount":551.88,"local_amount":3794.17,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3807.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296795},{"amount":572.15,"local_amount":3933.52,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3947.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076950}],"funded_date":"2015-07-17T15:39:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathryn Luehm","image":830122}},{"id":908999,"name":"Teonilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teonilda is a 46-year-old married woman from Badian, Cebu.

Her business is weaving blankets from alpaca wool.  She is enterprising, independent, dependable, optimistic, determined, responsible and very hard-working.  She operates her business in the \"Batallas\" (Battles) area, which is located at an altitude of approximately 3,800 meters above sea level.  It's a tourist site, located 87 kilometers from the city and her main method of transportation is by boat.

She is short, with a medium complexion and she dresses traditionally wearing a hat, scarf, and skirt.  Her native language is Aymara which she speaks at home, and she also speaks Spanish for the broader culture and for her business.\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her family members with whom she works.  They live in a room that is property of the family and constructed of brick and cement with a metal roof.  They have electricity and a well that uses a pump to get water.  \r\n\r\nHer business is weaving blankets from alpaca wool.  The blankets are rectangular pieces of cloth that serve for covering up in the cold.  Alpaca wool is a light fiber, warm, resistant, and soft, and has advantages over more utilized fibers such as sheeps wool or mohair. She comments that \" The appearance of alpaca wool is very similar to human hair and is dense and shiny.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she has constant customers, but the disadvantage is the lack of capital to purchase the wool wholesale.  Her dream is to open a large and complete weaving workshop and she wants to purchase the wool wholesale to have the materials she needs for work on hand.  \r\n\r\nThis is the first in a sequence of loans with the organization in the 10 years that she's been developing this trade.  It is for these reasons that Veronica is requesting a loan to purchase alpaca wool wholesale to continue with her business and open a weaving workshop."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":221.97,"image":{"id":1908993,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase alpaca wool wholesale to continue her business and open a weaving workshop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-06-30T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-30T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-20T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T04:00:00Z","amount":47.13},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T04:00:00Z","amount":44.94},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T04:00:00Z","amount":41.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T04:00:00Z","amount":40.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T04:00:00Z","amount":47.85},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T04:00:00Z","amount":46.32},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T04:00:00Z","amount":48.19},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T04:00:00Z","amount":51.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T04:00:00Z","amount":49.28},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T04:00:00Z","amount":58.42},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T04:00:00Z","amount":57.89},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T04:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T04:00:00Z","amount":61.31},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T04:00:00Z","amount":64.89},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T04:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2016-09-13T04:00:00Z","amount":70.85},{"due_date":"2016-10-13T04:00:00Z","amount":72.69},{"due_date":"2016-11-14T04:00:00Z","amount":74.03},{"due_date":"2016-12-13T04:00:00Z","amount":79.06},{"due_date":"2017-01-13T04:00:00Z","amount":80.94},{"due_date":"2017-02-14T04:00:00Z","amount":83.77},{"due_date":"2017-03-13T04:00:00Z","amount":88.92},{"due_date":"2017-04-13T04:00:00Z","amount":91.17},{"due_date":"2017-05-15T04:00:00Z","amount":74.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.32},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.28},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.42},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.89},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.31},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.89},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.85},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.69},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.03},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.06},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.94},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.77},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.92},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.17},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":92.07,"local_amount":92.07,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":92.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554880},{"amount":41.08,"local_amount":41.08,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":41.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468964},{"amount":40.97,"local_amount":40.97,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":40.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296796},{"amount":47.85,"local_amount":47.85,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":47.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076951}],"funded_date":"2015-07-02T01:43:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathryn Luehm","image":830122}},{"id":909026,"name":"Stanley","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stanley is a smallholder farmer residing in Kaplamai division, Kenya.

She lives with her husband and brother-in-law. Patima requested a loan from local financial institutions several times but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because the creditors did not find the existing family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. The only source of income for the family is a small-scale family agricultural business. They grow nuts and grapes on a family-owned plot of land and they also have a dairy cow. They sell milk products, nuts and wine at the local market. Patima requested a loan from Credo to expand their agribusiness and make it more productive.

Marcos is certain that a solar system will make him a more productive worker, and improve he and his familiy's life by no longer exposing them to gases and toxic fumes."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":180.37,"image":{"id":1909008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"To purchase a solar system that will improve his standard of living.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Olanchito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":390,"posted_date":"2015-06-30T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-30T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":958.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":972.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":987.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1002.28},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1017.32},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1032.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1048.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1063.79},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1079.74},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1095.94},{"due_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1112.38},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1129.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.42},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.93},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.41},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.17},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.09,"local_amount":958.5,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:58:30Z","rounded_local_amount":967.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696733824},{"amount":44.75,"local_amount":972.88,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T20:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":982.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711665214},{"amount":45.42,"local_amount":987.47,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":997.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731169896},{"amount":46.11,"local_amount":1002.28,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1011.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752258312}],"funded_date":"2015-07-12T03:44:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Manolo Rodriguez","image":null}},{"id":904329,"name":"Jose Miguel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miguel un hombre con 40 a\u00f1os de edad, casado, con un hijo de 5 a\u00f1os, que por necesidad econ\u00f3mica monto un sala de internet, por el medio el cual ha logrado salir adelante con su familia.\n\nEl sue\u00f1o de este hombre es comprar una vivienda, y as\u00ed poder darle a u familia una estabilidad.\n\nMiguel solicito un cr\u00e9dito con el cual compara una CPU y le har\u00e1 un mantenimiento general a los equipos, lo cual le permitir\u00e1 generar mas ingresos.\n\nApoya este sue\u00f1o, haz un pr\u00e9stamo.\n\n","en":"Miguel is a 40-year-old man, who is married and has a 5-year-old son.

Organic coffee production is new in the region and it not only allows better coffee prices but also helps to not contaminate the numerous water sources in the area. Feliciano is asking for a loan to convert his coffee plants to organic production. Taking advantage of the fact that his plants are not in the best condition, his decision is to replant and begin the certification from 0. With the earnings from his coffee, Feliciano hopes to give his family a better quality of life and to form a small legacy for his children.

These ladies were motivated to join Friendship Bridge in order to access the \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d program that combines small loans and non-formal educational trainings. \r\n\r\nAntonia is beginning her second loan cycle.  Since she began with \u201cCasa de Jes\u00fas\u201d last year, she has seen the positive results of an injection of income into her local business of selling snacks, chicken and fries along with tortillas.  Antonia is requesting a new loan in order to buy an industrial stove, soft drinks, juices, corn for tortillas, chicken and potatoes so that she can continue to expand and grow her businesses.\r\n\r\nAntonia and the ladies in the group are very aware of the value of education. It is a priority for them to enroll their children in school. As all of them have had little or no education, they look forward to their monthly meetings with a Friendship Bridge Facilitator shares useful information with them on a variety of subjects. They learn how to take care of themselves and their families with new knowledge about hygiene, nutrition, and the use of medicinal plants.

She has everything as per requirement of basic necessities of life: a good shop with permanent income and other allied items to manage her family. Still, her family members are not happy due to the inavailability of a good RCC (reinforced cement concrete) owned house.\r\n\r\nThey are staying at their own house but it is roofed with asbestos. The current house is made from lower standard brick and roofed with asbestos, which creates a very critical situation during rainy season. It is also very difficult to stay during winter period. The most important thing is the house is not completely secure and safe. \r\n\r\nIn this situation, she decided to re-construct an RCC house with all possible facilities. She has already started to construct the house. But she is not having sufficient funds to complete it. So she decided to borrow loan from any bank or other financial institution.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Runa came to Mahashakti Foundation to know about house loan details.

No doubt she has everything as per requirement of basic necessities of life: small but permanent income, a two-wheeler, a good shop and other allied items to manage her family. Still her family members are not happy. Why? Due to inavailability of a good RCC (reinforced concrete cement) owned house.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t mean that they are staying in an open place or a thatched house. But they are staying at a rented house with a high rate of rent charged by the house owner.

The most important thing is that the house is not completely secure and safe.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, Santilata decided to construct an RCC house for a better standard.
