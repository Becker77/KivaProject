So he hopes with Kiva lenders and Nor Horizon support to achieve a good result and to rise up the income from his activities.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1917088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a lot of fodder for his pigs and chickens and to buy 2 more piglets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Ijevan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2015-07-01T18:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-31T18:30:05Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sevak","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":17910},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25100},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":24780},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25200},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25960},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25430},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":27420},{"due_date":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":26680},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":27420},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":28670},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":28370},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":28630},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":29770},{"due_date":"2016-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":30040},{"due_date":"2016-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":30180},{"due_date":"2016-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":31030},{"due_date":"2016-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":31540},{"due_date":"2016-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":31930},{"due_date":"2016-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":32590},{"due_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":32840},{"due_date":"2017-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":33740},{"due_date":"2017-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":34330},{"due_date":"2017-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":34740},{"due_date":"2017-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":35700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.49},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.76},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.17},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.76},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.44},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.79},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.35},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.79},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.67},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.49},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.59},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.42},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.84},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.37},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.3},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.56},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.44},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":910583,"name":"Kenzhekul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041a\u0435\u043d\u0436\u0435\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c, 36 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435, \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0436\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 -

This is the first round of loans with the institution in the 4 years he has been pursuing professional studies.<br \/><br \/>It is for these reasons that Juan is applying for a loan to pay the fees for his degree to be able to finish it and grow in his work."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":64.5,"image":{"id":1909777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay the fees for his degree so that he can finish it and move forward in his work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-01T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-31T18:40:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-20T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T04:00:00Z","amount":88.62},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T04:00:00Z","amount":83.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T04:00:00Z","amount":80.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T04:00:00Z","amount":88.49},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T04:00:00Z","amount":88.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T04:00:00Z","amount":87.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T04:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T04:00:00Z","amount":93.02},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T04:00:00Z","amount":94.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T04:00:00Z","amount":99.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T04:00:00Z","amount":99.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T04:00:00Z","amount":101.21},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T04:00:00Z","amount":104.31},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T04:00:00Z","amount":106.45},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T04:00:00Z","amount":107.83},{"due_date":"2016-09-15T04:00:00Z","amount":110.1},{"due_date":"2016-10-17T04:00:00Z","amount":111.77},{"due_date":"2016-11-15T04:00:00Z","amount":115.98},{"due_date":"2016-12-15T04:00:00Z","amount":117.77},{"due_date":"2017-01-16T04:00:00Z","amount":119.33},{"due_date":"2017-02-15T04:00:00Z","amount":122.63},{"due_date":"2017-03-15T04:00:00Z","amount":125.67},{"due_date":"2017-04-17T04:00:00Z","amount":127.19},{"due_date":"2017-05-15T04:00:00Z","amount":131.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.32},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.06},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.95},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.9},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.87},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.18},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.65},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.97},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.17},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.51},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.77},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.4},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.66},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.9},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.85},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.08},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.83,"local_amount":172.21,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:30Z","rounded_local_amount":178.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554884},{"amount":12.56,"local_amount":83.72,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:02Z","rounded_local_amount":86.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468968},{"amount":12.79,"local_amount":85.31,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":88.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296800},{"amount":13.32,"local_amount":88.77,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:11Z","rounded_local_amount":91.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076955}],"funded_date":"2015-07-06T03:31:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deepa R.","image":null}},{"id":909711,"name":"Aysar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aysar is a 24-year-old young man from small village near Ramallah City.

children. She has a secondary education and, to provide the primary source of income for her family, Raisa is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started this business 20 years ago with a purchase of a cow and 3 piglets.

She invested the loan which she obtained in the purchase of manicure materials (Virginia is sitting in the chair in the photo). The payment of her dues was punctual, since she did not have problems.\r\n\r\nHer wishes to improve resulted in her leading a Communal Bank of people to request a loan to improve their work. Their businesses include: sandwich sales, ceramic crafts, refreshment sales, book shop, secondhand clothing sales, sales of fruits, sales of tomatoes, tire shop, construction services, and sales of chicken.\r\n\r\nFor her job, Virginia takes care of embellishing the hands, specifically giving attention to the nails and painting them. Parallel to this activity, she started the business of imitation jewelry sales, including sales of bracelets, rings, necklaces, hair ties, etc. This business goes hand in hand with her other work. \"I started the imitation jewelry business because my customers would ask for accessories for parties or for daily use,\" comments Virginia. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her jobs is that they are related with each other.

For the past five years, his neighbors and acquaintances who did not have this appliance in their home have rented the washing machines by the hour and they do this work more comfortably, especially the housewives, and also he gives them a savings in water since washing by hand wastes more of this natural resource.

This is the ninth loan that she has requested and has been a client of the foundation since 1998.  She is a very enterprising woman who has always sought to maintain her economic independence and improve her quality of life.  She is also a very active woman; at 71 years of age, she has all of the motivation and strength necessary to continue growing her business, in addition her excellent health.  Rosa lives with her husband who is now retired, one daughter, her son-in-law and two grandsons, who she always helps economically.\r\n\r\nShe has more than 20 years of experience after having started her commercial profession, all in the area of food sales.  She started by selling empanadas, chicken and pastries at a factory where her older brother worked.  She also made herself known at the Loyola School, when she went to leave something to eat for her child who was studying in elementary school at this institution.  It was there that the director of the education center offered her a position at the school at a kiosk belonging to a soft drink company and sold soda, juice, milk, ice cream, cookies, pre-packaged snacks, seeds, and also fast foods like empanadas, hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken and all kinds of pastries.  During this time, she has managed to consolidate her business, ensuring her place in the institution.  Her next short-term goal is to have better equipment for her stall, which the Board of Education approved, meaning that they are going to build a small stall with more space for merchandise, which is different from the kiosk that she currently has.\r\n\r\nRight now, the client needs to strengthen her assets, since she started new projects related to food sales, with a similar focus as that of the kiosk.  She must improve her equipment and merchandise.  Her clients are all students and professors from the educational center, in addition to night school attendees, to whom she sells every day in the evening.  She doesn\u2019t have competition within the educational center.  Regarding her seasonality during vacation times, she continues selling pastries at a glass factory nearby, as well as seeds and some sweets that she packs up and sells to a distributor. \r\nThis new loan presents an opportunity to update her equipment, since some of her appliances are a little deteriorated, as well as invest in merchandise to better grow her business packing and selling seeds and sweets.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":170.95,"image":{"id":1908126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase equipment such as a sealing machine, a food scale, an electric griddle and other appliances, as well as general merchandise for the kiosk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"San Nicolas, Loyola, Cartago","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2015-07-01T20:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-07-31T20:30:06Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29283.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":29722.72},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30168.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30621.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":31080.41},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31546.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":32019.81},{"due_date":"2016-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":32500.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":32987.61},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33482.43},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33984.66},{"due_date":"2016-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":34494.43},{"due_date":"2016-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":35011.85},{"due_date":"2016-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":35537.03},{"due_date":"2016-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":36070.08},{"due_date":"2017-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":36611.13},{"due_date":"2017-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":37160.3},{"due_date":"2017-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":37717.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.13},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.82},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.57},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.47},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.37},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.29},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.23},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.18},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.14},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.11},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.11},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.11},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.13},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.17},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.22},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":113.13,"local_amount":59022.97,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-19T12:13:10Z","rounded_local_amount":60307.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731625148},{"amount":57.82,"local_amount":30168.81,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-02T13:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":30825.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752084075}],"funded_date":"2015-07-11T19:31:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carlie Herron","image":1714606}},{"id":904920,"name":"Fernando Emilio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El negocio de Sastrer\u00eda de Fernando inici\u00f3 gracias a su c\u00f3nyuge, quien hace quince a\u00f1os  le propuso que aprendiera este arte en el cual ella podr\u00eda ser su maestra puesto que desde joven se ha dedicado a esta actividad, \u00e9l acepto con mucho entusiasmo y al convertirse en un experto organiz\u00f3 su taller en el que produce pantalones, camisas, ropa multiusos y adicionalmente el servicio de cl\u00ednica de ropa; \u00e9l se encuentra satisfecho con los resultados obtenidos pues con la actividad de la confecci\u00f3n ha logrado el sustento diario de su familia.

Her family comprises her husband and three children (two sons and a daughter). In her childhood, Kabita never got a chance to attend school because of her family's financial issues, so she is illiterate but can sign her name. Amongst her children, two are attending school and one is a preschooler. <br \/><br \/>Kabita's husband works as a mason. Due to the irregular job, his income is inconsistent and hardly sufficient for the family of five members. To meet the family\u2019s expenses, Kabita has been rearing a dairy cow, and her source of income comes from selling milk in her locality. She started this business because cows' milk is in much demand in her region.

This business idea came about thanks to a suggestion from a friend and a year and a half ago Jhonatan decided to set up his sales point where he offers hot dogs, hamburgers, kebabs, brochettes, and soft drinks.

The group demonstrated a great deal of punctuality and responsibility in repaying their loan. They have all been successful in their small businesses.  Ana, the 45-year-old president of the group, is an example of their success.  She is the owner of a small business that makes and sells cotton-threaded woven fabrics such as scarves, shawls, bedspreads, and aprons.  At first her business was out of her home. When she saw that she needed to support her husband, she began offering her products in shops and is now selling them wholesale. Ana is requesting a new loan to buy quality threads and yarns in many colors in order to attract more customers.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the loan, Ana receives monthly trainings through the Friendship Bridge\u2019s informal education program. The combination of loans and education is called Microcredit Plus. These trainings are on many important topics that she and the other members can put to use on a daily basis. Each month the Trust Bank Facilitator provides an in-depth lesson on subjects like self-esteem, self-empowerment, and women\u2019s & children\u2019s health. The women also gain valuable business tools for managing their businesses. They learn about accounting, bookkeeping, marketing, pricing, and customer relations.  \r\n\r\nAna and the other members of Brisas San Juan are exceedingly grateful to Kiva investors for having confidence in them, and supporting them with loans that help them to have a better quality of life and look forward to a brighter future.

jumper. He has competed nationally and internationally, trained for the Olympic Trials, and is extremely passionate about training other athletes. It was through his experiences in track and field that Dr. Michael became drawn to chiropractic medicine.\r\n\r\nEarly in his career he suffered a serious back injury. However, with the help of a sports chiropractor he was able to compete again with full abilities in a very short period of time. From then on, Dr. Michael was convinced that there is a major role for chiropractic medicine to play in the health field. Following up on that belief, he attended schools of chiropractic medicine in New York and Los Angeles, and obtained his Doctorate of Chiropractic from the Cleveland Chiropractic College in 2011.\r\n\r\nWith a strong athletic background, Dr. Michael went on to specialize in sports chiropractic and rehabilitation. Dr. Michael is extremely active in his field, consistently attending chiropractic conferences both locally and abroad, always looking to expand his ability to treat patients effectively. He is a doctor for the Reebok Crossfit Games, National Pro Grid League (NPGL), and the La Reign. Dr. Michael strongly believes in the body\u2019s ability to heal itself, and is of the view that the primary role of chiropractic medicine is to assist this process. To that end, he employs a number of chiropractic techniques in his individualized approach and treatment protocol. He also offers diet and nutrition analysis, workout regimens, lifestyle advice, and physiotherapy techniques. \r\n\r\nDr. Michael is now practicing out of a shared space with a fellow colleague in West Hollywood. This loan will allow him to purchase equipment and other materials that will further expand the range of services the business can provide and improve the overall income of the business.

What makes this booth different from the plethora of booths in L.A. and Orange County  is that it is an open photo booth that comfortably allows for up to 25 people to be captured in the shot. \n\nWith the help from Kiva, Jessica will be able to purchase the photo booth and develop her business. \n

This is Dede, one of Ruma\u2019s agents. Dede lives in Sukabumi, a village located at the foot of Mount Gede in West Java, about 80 km (50 miles) from the national capital of Indonesia, Jakarta. Dede is happily married, and together with his wife, they have three children. As his main source of income, Dede owns and manages a small stall that sells mobile airtime credits and mobile phone accessories.<br \/><br \/>By supporting this loan, you will be providing extra working capital for Dede's shop. This will allow Dede to become an agent for Ruma\u2019s layaway product called \"Mapan\", designed for lower-income communities. Mapan enables customers to save, little by little, by depositing change at agents like Dede and as their balance grows, it allows customers to make major asset purchases like housewares, appliances, and school supplies for their children. As a Mapan agent, Dede is responsible for processing deposits from customers into their Mapan accounts as well as receiving orders from customers who want to buy products listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog.

This will allow Ati to become an agent for Ruma\u2019s layaway product called \"Mapan,\" designed for lower-income communities. Mapan enables customers to save up, little by little, by depositing change at agents like Ati, and as their balance grows, it allows customers to make major asset purchases like housewares, appliances, and school supplies for their children. \r\n\r\nAs a Mapan agent, Ati is responsible for processing deposits from customers into their Mapan accounts, as well as receiving orders from customers who want to buy products listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer orders, Ati will submit the order via SMS and, within 5-10 days, the product will be delivered to the customer. With Mapan, Ati believes that her community will be able to have access to higher quality products with lower prices. \r\n\r\nAti is the one who is seen in the photo.

She is married to Julieto, a warehouseman. They live in Butuan City, the capital city of Agusan Del Norte in Mindanao. \r\n\r\nMarilou runs a \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store. Her income from this business goes up and down due to stiff competition within the area. Aside from this, many of her neighbors have the habit of paying later for those items they get. Sometimes it takes a few days or weeks before they pay. She is a kind-hearted person who cannot refuse her neighbors because she understands that there are times when it\u2019s really hard to earn money. \r\n\r\nBecause of this unstable income from her store, she decided to convert one room of her house into a room-for-rent to supplement their everyday expenses. As of now, she is requesting a loan amounting to PHP 8,000, which she will use to buy raw materials for an additional room-for-rent. Part of it will be used to buy more supplies for her variety store. Hopefully, she can boost her income with this additional capital and slowly move forward towards her dream of putting up a 24-hour convenience store.  \r\n\r\nMarilou meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1915757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials for an additional room-for-rent and to buy more supplies for her variety store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Butuan City, Agusan Del Norte","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-02T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-01T05:30:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.68,"local_amount":4266.64,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4818.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523507},{"amount":39.99,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1807.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433936},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.37,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2409.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954855}],"funded_date":"2015-07-02T06:02:07Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":910023,"name":"Estela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Estela is a married woman with eight children.

He used to work in the construction business and he had his own business in this domain. Besides his business, he had a small poultry farm which is his hobby. \r\n\r\nThroughout the years, his poultry farm started to develop and the number of chicken started to increase, so he started five years ago selling chickens and now he has his own customers and a good reputation among his region. On the other side, he set his construction tools to rent.\r\n\r\nHafez is a hard worker and ambitious man, who enjoy poultry farming and wants to develop it more, thus today he is acquiring a loan from Kiva's field partner Al Majmoua to increase his merchandise, with more chickens which will help him satisfy his customers' increasing requests.  He also wants to start a new business of cattle farming.\r\n\r\nHafez hopes to expand his business more in the future to increase his income and stay capable of improving his family's living conditions inside the camp.
