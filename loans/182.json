She is a cheerful, hard working woman who is married to Germ\u00e1n, 40.  They\u2019ve had three children that she wants to provide a good future for.  Elisa is her spouse\u2019s unconditional supporter.  Together they till the soil.  They have various crops on their property like coffee, cocoa beans, bananas and palillo (Peruvian plant similar to the guava tree).  She\u2019s worked as a farmer for 18 years.\r\n\r\nOn her free days when there is no harvesting to do she undertakes other businesses at home.  She sells a variety of local fruit like: bananas, mangoes, pineapples, zapote (Sapota-tree, sapodilla, and its luscious apple-shaped fruit) and a variety of citrus fruits.  She also takes advantage of the summer season to prepare her fruit beverages.  She feels that her sales stand is very profitable because thanks to it she\u2019s been able to pay for her children\u2019s schooling.  She considers January, February and March to be unfavorable seasons due to the presence of intermittent rains which lead to diminished crops and less fruit sales caused by road collapses that take place along the transportation routes.\r\n\r\nElisa hopes to obtain the loan to improve her kiosk.  To do so, she will buy shelving and display cases to better display her fruit.  In time, she plans to improve the facades of her home to provide better appearance for her kiosk.\r\n\r\nThis will be her third loan so she needs support from all of you to continue growing.  She is a very active member of her communal bank.  She will use the 1000 new soles from the loan to buy shelving and counters to place her products.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":802295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy shelving and display cases.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-30T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":152.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":157.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":162.61},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":170.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175.6},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":181.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.05},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.98},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.99},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.85},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.05,"local_amount":152.13,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":157.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719226},{"amount":59.13,"local_amount":157.69,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":163.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350689},{"amount":60.98,"local_amount":162.61,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":168.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851077},{"amount":63.99,"local_amount":170.63,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":176.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666256},{"amount":65.85,"local_amount":175.6,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":181.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621382},{"amount":68,"local_amount":181.34,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":187.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835464}],"funded_date":"2011-07-01T12:16:14Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":316384,"name":"Dand\u00e9 L\u00e9gnol Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe de solidarit\u00e9 dand\u00e9 l\u00e9gnol a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 le 29\/06\/2009.Il est compos\u00e9 de 19 femmes qui sont issues de la m\u00eame localit\u00e9.\n\nMadame S\u00e9mou en position debout et \u00e0 l'extreme droite est responsable du groupement,elle est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 41 ans,elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 04 enfants,en plus elle assure la garde de 04 autres enfants dont elle a la charge.\n\nSa principale activit\u00e9 est la restauration,activit\u00e9 qu'elle fait depuis longtemps.\n\nSon pr\u00eat lui permettra d'acheter les condiments n\u00e9cessaires pour la bonne marche de son restaurant.\n\nSon  objectif est d'assurer la scolarit\u00e9 de ses enfants,augmenter la taille de son restaurant et renforcer sa capacit\u00e9 d'\u00e9pargne.","en":"The solidarity group Dand\u00e9 L\u00e9gnol was created on June 29, 2009.

R. lives in the city of Vahdat. She is 47 years old, married and has 5 children. She has a high school degree. Shamsiya is a housewife but her main occupation as well as the main source of income for her family is agriculture. She rents a plot of land where she grows wheat and potatoes. After harvest she keeps part of the crops for her family and sells the rest. Currently it is planting season in Tajikistan and Shamsiya requires additional funding to purchase seeds of wheat, potatoes and fertilizer. That is why she has planned to take out this loan. This loan will help her buy quality seeds and harvest a quality harvest which will help her attract new clients and be able to sell all the crops she grows. Shamsiya is planning to pay back the loan in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0420\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 55; married; and the father of 4 children who are 32, 28, 20, and 19.  Three of them have their own homes.  He studied through the 4th grade of the old education system and didn't continue because his parents didn't have the financial resources to keep paying for his school.  He lives in his own home and supports his mother and his grandchildren that live with him.  He left the central neighborhood in the city of Maputo for Boane with his family in 1974 to start a new life.  He is a merchant and has owned his own business for more than 20 years.  He works with his wife from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day.  He sells beer and soft drinks and earns a monthly income of around 5,000 to 6,000 meticais.  He saves some of it in his bank account.  He has never requested a loan from another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through some friends.  This is his 4th loan, and it is for 20,000 meticais.  He will use it to purchase products (soft drinks, wine, beer, etc.) for his business.  His previous loans were for 8,000, 10,000, and 13,000 meticais, and they were all used for the same purpose.  He would like to use this loan to meet the needs of his customers.

D. G., 43 years old, lives together with her husband, Victor Manuel, and her two children, Joel and No\u00e9, 23 and 22 years old respectively, who work as builders building new homes or doing improvements or modifications of existing houses.  Their father is a shopkeeper.  They live in a semi urban area of the Ereguayquin municipality, in the Usulutan department.  Several years ago, Teresa, realizing that the income from her husband's business was not enough to cover the costs of her home, decided to help him and installed a grain grinder in her home.  She uses it to grind corn, beans, cracklings, yucca, flour among other things.  Several months ago, seeing that the frequency of her customers has diminished due to competition, Teresa decided to set times where she and her husband are at the grinder and otherwise she goes to sell clothing door to door in the adjoining communities or at the regional market of the municipality.

She is 46 years old, married, and is the mother of seven children whose ages she does not remember.  Five of the children go to school.  Hort\u00eancia only completed sixth grade; she did not continue because of a lack of money.  She lives in her own house with her family and does not support anyone else.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 she left Inhambane for Maputo, where she took up residence.  Later, owing to difficulties she faced in her life, she decided to start a business in Boane.  She has had her own business for more than six years.  She has no employees, but sometimes her children help her.  She earns around 3,500 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses and for saving with friends through Xitique (a traditional system of rotating savings).\r\n\r\nShe had a loan for her business through Tchuma Credit Association, but she later decided not to continue with them.  She learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also customers of this institution.  This is her first loan here.  She is asking for 15,000 meticais, with which she will buy products (sugar, soft drinks, cakes, crackers and other items) to increase the amount of merchandise in her shop.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay off this loan on time so she may take out other loans.  In the future, she would like to ask for more loans to improve her house and invest more in her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

Creciendo Juntas\u201d translates as \u201cThe Women\u00b4s Bank of United Growth\u201d. The eight women members live in Aguas Fr\u00edas, Lim\u00f3n, located in the hot and humid Caribbean region of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group are involved in various income-generating activities including sewing, animal rearing (chickens, cows and pigs) as well as the harvesting of plantains, rice and watermelons. This loan will be used generally by the members to invest in the growth of their individual productive activities. The women involved in animal rearing plan to use this loan to purchase livestock and animal feed.\r\n\r\nThe women of this group are able to contribute significantly to their family incomes as a result of the earnings generated from their productive activities. This income is supplemented by salaries earned by the men in their families who work as laborers in the pineapple and banana fields of Aguas Fr\u00edas.\r\n\r\nThe women have expressed great concern for the environmental devastation to the community river and health problems that their husbands and sons have developed as a result of working for the employer who owns the land. Respiratory problems, infertility and skin ailments are listed by the women of this group as common side effects of men laboring in the fields. The women attribute these negative effects to the fact that the employer provides faulty equipment, and the men are required to work with heavy, toxic chemicals in places with little or no shade. For the residents of this community, there are few employment opportunities. This daily reality describes the struggle that these women must cope with.\r\n\r\nEdel S. F. has a sewing business and an agricultural business. She will use this loan primarily to invest in her agriculture business by purchasing watermelon, rice and squash seeds as well as agricultural nutrients. The loan will also be used to invest in the purchase of materials for making clothes which will enable her to produce more sewing products. Edel says she operates on a per order basis, her clients request a certain type of product whether it be men\u2019s, women\u2019s, or children\u2019s clothing and she produces it within a given period.\r\n\r\nEdel\u2019s goals are to produce more, both agriculturally and in her sewing activity. She hopes to expand both businesses and increase her income. She says her main obstacle is access to working capital and this loan will help to address this challenge. Another obstacle for Edel is the fact that her sewing machine is very old and doesn\u2019t work very well. It breaks down often, at which times she must hire a mechanic to come and repair it.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group have known each other for over ten years. They say that they prefer the group lending model to the individual lending model because, as a group, they can support each other and learn from one another.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":532872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase watermelon, rice and squash seeds as well as more materials for making clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Aguas Fr\u00edas, Lim\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-04-29T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2375,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shirley","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marixa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ambar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2375,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1205787.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411556}],"funded_date":"2010-05-01T01:38:31Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T14:02:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":201665,"name":"Claudia Milena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Claudia  Milena O.

Two of her children are in school, and she also takes care of an additional dependent who is an orphan. Juliet has a business selling mats and other crafts, which she has had for several years.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Juliet is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used for buying more craft materials and other supplies for her to make her mats and other crafts.  Juliet hopes to have a more successful business and generate profit in order to support her children and the orphan she takes care of in their schooling.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: \r\n\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  \r\n\r\nThese loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":558651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, snack foods and toothpaste in the local community. Anatalia has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Anatalia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anatalia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Anatalia is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like canned goods and snack foods. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Anatalia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue she generates to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Chill\u00e1n es conocida como \u201cCuna de la Patria\u201d o \u201cTierra de Artistas\u201d, debido a que en la ciudad han nacido destacados personajes de la historia de Chile, como por ejemplo el conocido pianista Claudio Arrau.\n\n","en":"\r\nThis communal bank is called \u201cSol de Cayumanqui\u201d and is composed of 17 entrepreneurs who are in a variety of occupations.  Among them are: children\u2019s clothing sales, grocery sales, running a kiosk, pastry making and services.  All of them are from the city of Chill\u00e1n.\r\n\r\nSandra, who in the photo is in the middle wearing a gray jacket, black pants and purse and has her hair gathered up, runs a kiosk in her front yard where she sells groceries and snacks.  She\u2019s been in this line of work for two years.  She buys her merchandise from suppliers and wholesale supermarkets.  She comments that she sells lots of snacks and that\u2019s kept her business well.  However, selling groceries has been somewhat difficult because of competition.  Her work schedule is all day, every day of the week.  This way she does not lose any customers or any sales.  She will use the loan to buy candy, cookies, flavorings for milk, peaches and canned fish.  Her business goals are to prosper and to generate higher income to provide for her home economically and attain a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nSandra lives with her husband and two children who are 19 and 9 years of age.  Her oldest daughter is taking classes at a university prep school to get ready to take her university admission test.  Her dream is that she\u2019ll be able to study a university career and attain a professional degree.  Another of her dreams is to go on vacation with the entire family to various places in the country.\r\n\r\nSandra is very happy with and grateful for the services obtained from Fondo Esperanza and stresses proudly the values that are instilled in the institution, like honesty and solidarity, to incorporate into the communal bank group.  She comments that she\u2019s learned from the training sessions and is now generating strategies to innovate her business to acquire a larger number of customers.  In this way she plans to incorporate home-made jams and pastry items that she herself makes.\r\n\r\nChill\u00e1n is a commune in south-central Chile.  Its name means \u201cchair of the sun\u201d in Mapudungun, the indigenous Mapuche language.  Chill\u00e1n is known as the \u201cNation\u2019s Cradle\u201d or \u201cLand of Artists\u201d because many outstanding figures in Chile\u2019s history were born here, like the well-known pianist, Claudio Arrau.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3375,"image":{"id":820969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Chill\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-07-24T18:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3375,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yenny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Priscila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ximena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ram\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Priscila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Orlando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"H\u00e9ctor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nieves","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"B\u00e1rbara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1553100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96439},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":105836},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105010},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":109551},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":108902},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":109941},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":110992},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":110946},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":114063},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":114201},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":114654},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":116870},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117502},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":118193}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.57},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.99},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.19},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.07},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.65},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.91},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.19},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":248.17},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":249.15},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":253.97},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1142.47,"local_amount":525738,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":526848.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227035307},{"amount":969.06,"local_amount":445942,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":446884.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232795964},{"amount":1006.63,"local_amount":463227,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":464205.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238606885},{"amount":256.84,"local_amount":118193,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":118442.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244561256}],"funded_date":"2011-07-26T23:03:26Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":324599,"name":"Khodor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khodor is a 25-year-old Lebanese single man living with his parents and three siblings.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

weeks ago Jacinta's business was robbed. Some criminals broke in and stole equipment from the calling center that she had opened with her son. The store had been open just five months.<p>\r\nJacinta tells us that it was her son who gave her the idea of having a calling center. At first he rented cell phone equipment at his university, but because of the competition he faced, he decided to buy a stand and to do that same business from his home. When she saw how well things were going, his mother thought of opening her own calling center. Thanks to a loan from EDAPROSPO, they were able to buy the necessary equipment.<p>\r\nJacinta is a hard-working woman and in addition to managing this business, she has an internet cafe business and for the past 28 years has run a convenience store. Because of these businesses, the losses from the robbery are not affecting her too much and she knows very well how to get up and start over again. Among her plans are to improve the layout of her calling center so that it has more security.<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nHace dos semanas la se\u00f1ora Jacinta sufri\u00f3 un robo en su negocio. Unos maleantes entraron y le robaron los equipos del locutorio que abri\u00f3 junto a su hijo. El local reci\u00e9n cumple cinco meses de inaugurado.<p>\r\nJacinta cuenta que fue su hijo quien le dio la idea de tener un locutorio. Al inicio \u00e9l alquilaba equipos de celulares en su universidad, pero frente a una gran competencia decidi\u00f3 comprar un m\u00f3dulo y hacer lo mismo afuera de su casa. Al ver que le iba bien pens\u00f3 con su mam\u00e1 abrir su locutorio.

S. lives in Vahdat with his wife and three children.  He is 36, and for 10 years of his life, Sherali has been in retail.  He owns a store where he sells groceries.  Since many food products spoil, causing inventory loss, Sherali has applied for a loan to buy a refrigerator for perishable items and cold drinks.  This will preserve Sherali's products, while at the same time providing locals with fresh, unspoiled food.  He plans to repay the loan within twelve months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><\/b> \r\n\r\n\u0421\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432

Her clientele is growing quickly beause she is a good cook. That is why she plans, with this month-of-May loan, to build up the stock of her restaurant so as to better satisfy her clientele and earn more money. With the same goals in mind, she would like to diversify her business by adding the sale of spices, which sells well in her neighborhood in the north-east of Kinshasa. <P>\r\n\r\nBrigitte began her career in sales for the first time in 1983. The initial capital that allowed her to buy 2 kilograms of meat to grill and sell as brochettes up until 1987 was US$ 4. <P>\r\n\r\nFrom 1987-2002, Brigitte attended secondary school and received her diploma. In 1987 she moved and decided to change over to selling fritters. The exorbitant hike in the price of vegetable oil, one of the main raw materials for making fritters, ended this business. From 2002 until today, Brigitte has been running a cooked food business which presently generates US$ 10 per week. Her ambition is to open a grocery store to satisfy the needs of the people of her neighborhood. She is 42, divorced, and the mother of 5 children, aged between 4 and 17. Four of them are enrolled in school. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4150,"image":{"id":324263,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"bolster the raw materials for her restaurant so as to earn more","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

Years later he had to take the basic curse for (P.R.M.) which lasted for a year. After he finished his course he worked at the Interior Ministry as security guard with a monthly salary of 3.000mt. But because he was the only one working in the family they were not able to fulfill their needs and requested a loan to the bank proCredito (Micro-Finance Bank) in Maputo for 20.000mt that he paid at 2.816mt monthly during a year. Because of the high demand for his products he  wasn't able to satisfy his client's needs in full.

The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 51 years old, a widow and has three adult-aged children. Emelia is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member receives an individual loan, they are all responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Emelia A.\u2019s Group. \r\n\r\nEmelia owns and operates a business making and selling food, snacks and other delicacies in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn March 2010, Emelia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6000 PHP from PMPC. Emelia is now requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP that will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her third taken from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nAbout Group Loans \r\nIn a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan but is part of a group of individuals bound by a group guarantee. Under this arrangement, each member of the group supports one another and is responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":625719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The wish of this happy and loving mother is to grow and multiply her stock of products, with the goal of meeting all of the requests of her new neighbors, who take a keen interest in this little store.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Zach Frey, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nEn una de las nuevas urbanizaciones de la ciudad de Juliaca est\u00e1 ubicado el domicilio de Julia, quien desde hace 8 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 adecuar un ambiente de su casa e implementar su bodega, gracias a los beneficios que obtiene con este negocio puede brindarles estudios a sus dos hijos, a quienes desea brindarles la oportunidad  de seguir sus estudios  superiores, oportunidad que ella nunca tuvo por los bajos recursos econ\u00f3micos de sus humildes padres.El deseo de esta alegre y amorosa madre es  ampliar y aumentar el stock de sus productos con el fin de complacer cada uno de las solicitudes de sus nuevos vecinos quienes encuentran en esta bodeguita  una c\u00e1lida atenci\u00f3n."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":182931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Investment capital to buy merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-07-24T22:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-08T15:02:52Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":216.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":218.95,"processed_date":"2008-09-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":227.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":320291},{"amount":80,"local_amount":218.95,"processed_date":"2008-10-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-09T07:07:57Z","rounded_local_amount":227.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":352522},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":212.11,"processed_date":"2008-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":220.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335435},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":225.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9956613},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":225.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10226868},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":216.65,"processed_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":225.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422112}],"funded_date":"2008-07-25T15:02:52Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T20:03:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":61536,"name":"Naseem M.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":224189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of lotions, perfumes, and handbags","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-13T02:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muslima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":80600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970752},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":80600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886969},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":80600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436229},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":80600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130501},{"amount":64.99,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:23Z","rounded_local_amount":80600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027298},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":80600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613319},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":80600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010402},{"amount":65.01,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":80600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232713},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":80600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664529},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":80600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105260}],"funded_date":"2008-11-15T21:13:58Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Olson","image":null}},{"id":77939,"name":"Senovia Antonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Senovia R. tiene la edad  de 36 a\u00f1os,  habita en el barrio Medardo Andino ubicado en municipio de Ticuantepe, junto a su esposo y hija, el esposo trabaja como gestor de cobro, para ayudarle con los gastos de la casa, la se\u00f1ora trabaja como analista en la DGI, desde hace ochos a\u00f1os, la mayor dificultad que ha tendido es la falta de recurso para poder mejorar su casa, ya que ella vive en un cuarto que le dio su mam\u00e1.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Meleseke has 3 years of experience in this business.  Meleseke needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 380 tala or US $158 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Meleseke joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Meleseke's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Meleseke P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score.

She is a housewife who lives with her family and children. Her husband is a tailor by profession and operates a tailoring shop in the market. He is very good at his art and very famous for his quality work. As a result, he receives a good number of orders, which sometimes creates problems for him to fulfill on time. He wants to buy another sewing machine and hire a worker who will assist him in fulfilling the larger orders on time. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Saira has applied for a loan from Asasah to help her husband buy another sewing machine to expand his business. She is hopeful that it will prove to be a good investment in her husband\u2019s tailoring business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":574763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase another sewing machine ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2010-07-26T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Munwar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suraiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Razia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":6363.64},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":6363.64},{"due_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":6363.64},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6363.64},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6363.64},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":6363.64},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":6363.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6363.64},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":6363.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":6363.64},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6363.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":6363.64,"processed_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6397.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166799606},{"amount":75,"local_amount":6363.64,"processed_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6397.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172069107},{"amount":75,"local_amount":6363.64,"processed_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:58:56Z","rounded_local_amount":6397.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177360196},{"amount":75,"local_amount":6363.64,"processed_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6397.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182494875},{"amount":75,"local_amount":6363.64,"processed_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":6397.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188629784},{"amount":75,"local_amount":6363.64,"processed_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6397.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191372717},{"amount":75,"local_amount":6363.64,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":6397.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195790175},{"amount":75,"local_amount":6363.64,"processed_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:16:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6397.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201231953},{"amount":75,"local_amount":6363.64,"processed_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6397.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206098399},{"amount":75,"local_amount":6363.64,"processed_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6397.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211168802},{"amount":75,"local_amount":6363.6,"processed_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:33:44Z","rounded_local_amount":6397.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216451546}],"funded_date":"2010-07-27T06:42:28Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:33:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":222179,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is a 31-year-old single lady.

Her husband works in a factory. She sells chickens in Eshowe in South Africa. Sithembile, the leader of her borrowing group, is raising her hand in the photo above.\r\n\r\nShe's been in this business for a year and sells from her home. She also earns income from the government's children grant.

She can work approximately 12 hours per day and she believes it is going well for her due to her variety of products and the friendly treatment she offers her clients.\r\n\r\nKathya is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to the help they offer she will be able to purchase merchandise for her business such as rice, sugar, milk, sodas, candy, and more as well as beauty products such as makeup, perfumes, lotions, etc. Thus Kathya's business will be better-stocked, and with this she hopes to be able to increase her sales and increase her income, which will help her greatly so that in the near future she can grow her business and have her own house."}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1185430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase groceries and beauty products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pisco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kathya Lisset ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":65.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":69.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":71.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":77.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":80.36},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":86.03},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":87.32},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":91.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":94.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":99.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":102.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.04},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.85},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.15},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.93},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.6},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jamie Schau","image":1143325}},{"id":730945,"name":"Perlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Perlita is 42 years old and married with one children.\n\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

Junto a su esposo, se dedica a la fabricaci\u00f3n artesanal de chupetes (a base de hielo) y helados (de crema), actividad que realiza desde hace 6 a\u00f1os. La idea surgi\u00f3 del consumo de sus propios hijos, y al contar con una refrigeradora dej\u00f3 de hacerlo s\u00f3lo para su familia y empez\u00f3 a elaborar en mayor cantidad para emprender este negocio. Todas las tardes elabora los chupetes que deja congelando hasta el d\u00eda siguiente, con el tiempo se ha implementado de diversos moldes y otra nevera, as\u00ed como gran cantidad de barquillos para los helados, los cuales prepara hasta las 11 de la ma\u00f1ana, y luego sale a repartir sus productos a las escuelas cercanas a su casa. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con algunas personas que le ayudan a vender, a quienes les paga por ello. La \u00e9poca m\u00e1s rentable es durantes los meses de verano, sin embargo, como en su regi\u00f3n hay un fuerte sol durante el d\u00eda, sus ganancias se mantienen estables, lo que ha convertido a este negocio en un sost\u00e9n econ\u00f3mico muy importante para la familia. Sus planes para el futuro son de mejorar los utensilios y el equipo que utiliza para tener una mayor producci\u00f3n y de mejor calidad. Es la tercera vez que Josefina tiene un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, ella es una de las socias m\u00e1s activas de su banco comunal y ahora renueva su compromiso de seguir trabajando en equipo y de manera responsable con sus pagos.

","en":"Josefina is 55 years old and lives with her husband and 2 children in their own home. Along with her husband they have been making home made popsicles and ice cream for the last 6 years. They had the idea to start this business when they saw how much their kids enjoyed their popsicles, so since they had a  freezer they just began to make them in larger quantities to undertake this business. She makes the popsicles every afternoon and lets them freeze until next day. Over  the time she has acquired various popsicle molds, another freezer, and a large number of waffle cones for the ice cream.\r\n<p>\r\nShe makes ice cream until 11am and then goes to distribute their products to schools near her home.  She hires some people to help to sell the products, and pays them for their job. The most profitable time is during the summer, however, because in her region they get a strong sun during the day most of the year, her earnings are stable.

She lives in her own home with her husband, Ra\u00fal, who is 47, and her beloved daughter, Natalia, who is12.  She sells nutritious products like potatoes, quinoa, geese, etc., in the Manco Capac market (a very important market in the city of Juliaca).  She is very happy and chatty, which is why her customers prefer to buy from her.  She also works with her daughter, who helps her with all of the sales that she makes.  Maria enjoys chatting with the people who have stands near her while she sells her products.  She has done this work for 15 years.  What she likes the least is that she gets dirty after every day of selling because of the dirt on the potatoes.  In the near future, Maria hopes to have a stand where she can sell her Andean products and in this way improve her quality of life to give her daughter a higher education.  This is her fourth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she is willing to make all of her payments on time because she doesn't want to cause any problems with her communal bank, where she is very loved by the other members.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ioe's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Ioe S. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.3 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He has been characterized as a very spirited and strong person whose successes are directly applied to his young family, composed of his wife and three children.\r\n\r\nThe work Shoirjon does is through the raising of livestock for eventual sale. It is necessary to point out that this is the only income that supports his family and that they really need it.\r\n\r\nToday, Shoirjon looks for support from IMON International to obtain the necessary loan to purchase more cows to raise. With this loan, his beloved family will benefit as much as he will.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells the same products by the case to her neighbors in the zone.  She added selling cheese to her business.  The cheese is sent to her from Sincelejo, a ranching municipality in the northeastern part of the country.  It is on the Caribbean coast of Colombia.\r\n\r\nIn her business Maria sells 64 cases of beer a month.  She buys directly from the truck that distributes to all of the sectors.  Most of her sales are for cash, and now her customers owe her for only three cases of beverages. Each day she gets more customers.\r\n\r\nFor her cheese business she is sent 150 pounds of cheese every two weeks from Sincelejo.  She sells this product on credit, and her customers pay her weekly.\r\n\r\nMaria is currently applying for her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy cases of beer and cheese.  She has orders from her fixed customers, and she needs to respond in a timely fashion so that they do not buy from other sellers.\r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge is the incessant rain that makes sales go down, especially the drinks like soft drinks and beer.  However, as the phenomena of La Ni\u00f1a is ending, her outlook for the future is improving, and she is very content.\r\n\r\nHer main goal is to have her business grow in order to offer her daughter as much prosperity as possible.  Above all, she wants to give her daughter a quality education.  She will need that in the future in order to be successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":782710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He will use the loan to buy building materials for the construction of his home. Manuel is a true beneficiary of micro-credit. He says that \"because of their social condition, in the past his family wasn't able to apply for credit from traditional banks\" and was therefore unable to improve their standard of living. He's extremely glad to be taking out his first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and Kiva, and plans to repay his loan so that he can establish a good credit history and have access to larger amounts in the future.\r\n\r\nManuel lives and works in San Francisco de Quito, the capital city of Ecuador. Most commonly called Quito, the city is also known as \u201cThe Light of America\u201d because it was the site of the first uprising against the Spanish and as the \u201cMiddle of the World,\u201d because it straddles the equator. Quito is famous for the nearby active volcano Pichincha, its soaring altitude of 9,200 feet, and its beautiful downtown historical district, declared the first UNESCO Heritage Site in 1978.\r\n\r\nManuel is a hard-working 40-year-old entrepreneur. He lives with his two daughters and wife Maria (his younger daughter is in the above photo). For two years, Manuel has sold scrap-metal for a living. The entire family helps out with Manuel's scrap-metal business. He and Maria both are engaged in the work and occasionally his daughters help him with pick-ups.

L. B. is 29 and has five kids. She raises pigs and will use this loan to purchase a cow to raise for milk production and to finance feed and care for the pigs.  This is her first loan with Friendship Bridge, and like most of the women doing their first credit, it's a bit scary. It's stressful to think of those loan payments, but she decided to go ahead with the loan anyway.  Her dream is to buy a few more calves and raise them. The remote village where she lives has lots and lots of pastureland, and the people make good use of it, raising lots of sheep, goats, and cattle.  Teresa's picture doesn't show her animals because she pastures them more than an hour's walk away, and it was not practical to visit them.<p>Like many people in her area, money has been hard to come by. There have been times when there just wasn't enough and Teresa has had to borrow from her neighbors. She has successfully paid them back, though.<p>Teresa is a member of the women's group Nueva Vision, or New Vision. Most of the women in her group, even the younger ones, cannot read, write, or speak Spanish. They primarily stay with their traditional ways and speak their native Ixil language. Until very recently, almost all the houses in this remote village were made of wood, a very poor building material for this area, but now most are of concrete block and adobe. The change is that many of the younger men are now working in another country and they send money home to their families, enabling the families to improve their housing. <p>Interviewed by Juana Cedillo in the Ixil language.<br\/>Written by Nancy Lewis and Randy Fay, Kiva Fellows."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":55080,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a calf and care for pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Nebaj, Quiche","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.405833 -91.146111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2007-08-21T05:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-04T06:36:41Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2007-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2007-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2007-10-04T09:20:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":62886},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2007-11-04T10:22:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":76294},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2007-12-04T10:21:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":91272},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2008-01-04T10:18:41Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108184},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2008-02-04T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128157},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2008-03-04T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":149180},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2008-04-04T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":173491},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2008-05-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200682},{"amount":27,"local_amount":27,"processed_date":"2008-06-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227828}],"funded_date":"2007-08-21T06:36:41Z","paid_date":"2008-06-04T09:06:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":20603,"name":"Catalina","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"CATALINA and her husband work growing flowers.

She makes lunches to sell in the \u201cZona Franca\u201d (a governmental organization that regulates exportation from Nicaragua).  She sells food for cash and for credit with weekly payments.  \r\n\r\nShe started her sales with funds that her husband gave her and the support of a friend.  She was able to start selling clothes and shoes, and she had customer orders.  But, sales in the last few months have been bad.  She did not get income, and she had clothes that she did not sell.  That is how the need to sell food emerged.  Every day she sells more.\r\n\r\nThat is why she turns to a loan.  She does not have sufficient capital to make the food.  She will buy meat, rice, beans, dairy products, and fruit to prepare the food and drinks.  \r\n\r\nShe gets up very early to make the different meals.  Her mother helps her.  She has to be en route to transport and deliver the lunch at the exact time.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan she wants to buy more plates, cups, and spoons among other things.  Now that her food sales have increased, she will also start to buy clothes.  In the Christmas month her customers order clothes for their children, which she gives them credit to buy with the ease of making several payments.\r\n\r\nShe thanks Afodenic for their help in improving her business.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or $167 per week) to continue to improve her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Taumaia joined SPBD.  This is her 6th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Taumaia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives there with her husband and two children. \r\n\r\nNoroy sells children's clothing. All the merchandise she offers for sale in her business is trademark quality at affordable prices. \r\n\r\nWhen Noroy launched her enterprise 20 years ago, it was pretty basic. However, she has consistently increased her clientele and the assortment of discount clothing imported from neighboring cities. \r\n\r\nNoroy is seeking a loan of 7,500 TJS to add to her stock and meet the growing demand for clothing. At this point, one of her business goals is to find reliable and accountable suppliers to partner with. \r\n\r\nNoroy has already repaid six loans to IMON International without any delinquencies. We believe her outstanding credit history and willingness to strive for higher goals will help her repay the current loan and reach success in her business.   \r\n  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
