When a customer orders, Duden will submit the order via SMS and, within 5-10 days, the product will be delivered to the customer.

Her husband works at a gas station.  Mijgona has been sewing women's dresses, from home, for the past two years already.  Both Mijgona and her husband work and do all they can to boost the family's budget.  They have now decided to renovate their home but they do not have the resources to carry out this project.  Mijgona has therefore decided to apply for a loan, because MDO Arvand supports women and offers them advantageous credit conditions.

This is Jafar, one of Ruma's agents. Jafar lives in Sukabumi, a village located at the foot of Mount Gede in West Java, about 80 km (50 miles) from the national capital of Indonesia, Jakarta. Jafar is happily married and together with his wife, they have one cute son together. Jafar's main source of income is selling electronics and housewares to his community. Jafar joined Ruma last year and he decided to join Ruma because he wanted to expand his business with technology, and right now, he is also becoming an agent who sells mobile airtime credits for his community. He is a hardworking man and his community sees him as a cheerful and kind mobile service provider.\r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Jafar needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits for his community, so his community can connect with their loved ones no matter how far they are apart. Jafar\u2019s goal towards Ruma in the near future is to serve as an e-commerce business for his community, Ruma\u2019s latest product called Mapan, so later, his community can have access to better products with lower prices. Jafar is the one who is seen in the photo. He is thankful for your kind support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1917626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase mobile airtime credits to help his village community members who need access to communication service.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Sukabumi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2015-07-02T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-01T15:10:04Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jafar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":7000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":7000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":908725,"name":"Amavi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"\u00c2g\u00e9e de 42ans, Amavi m\u00e8re de famille revend des produits alimentaires(boisson, riz, tomate...) qu'elle ach\u00e8te dans sa boutique.

Jemali's wife lives abroad and his daughters live with their father. <br \/><br \/>Jemali is busy with a small-scale agricultural business. He has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for agricultural business start-ups, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is a monthly income from their agricultural business. They have a vineyard and grow grapes, which are sold at the local open market. It is hardly enough for food for the family. <br \/><br \/>According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. Jemali requested a loan from Credo to start up a new type of business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor, who do not have access to credit products being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, he plans to buy a cow and start dairy farming.

He lives with his unemployed wife, son and daughter. <br \/><br \/>Bichiko requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for his trading business startup but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because the creditors did not find the existing family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. <br \/><br \/>The only source of income for the family is a small-scale family agricultural business. They have two greenhouses, one milk cow and a plot of agricultural land. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. <br \/><br \/>Bichiko requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

She has sold snacks, cooked side dishes, etc. for 15 years.  She has asked for a loan from KPP-UMKM Syariah for 7,200,000 rupiah. This loan will be used to buy materials and to build a bathroom, septic tank and a toilet at her home to improve access to water and sanitation for the family. She wants to have access to safe sanitation for the family, but the family income is still not enough to build a toilet and water resources for cash.  However, they are able to repay the loan.\r\n\r\nShe and her family want to live a healthy life with healthy sanitation.

Nancy is grateful that God has blessed her with a salon which has been her stable source of income used to provide for her and her child's daily needs. It is her passion for beauty and styling hair that drove her to open and maintain this kind of business. She attends seminars to both hone her skills in hair styling and update her with the newest trends. She has been operating her salon for several years already, so she has established a good reputation in the beauty business and has maintained regular customers. Through word of mouth her clients have increased over the years.\r\n\r\nTo help her expand operations of her beauty parlor she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy hair dye, shampoo, hair treatments, conditioner, and other beauty supplies. She thanks God and thanks you for your good heart, trusting that she will receive the financial aid she needs to continue to serve her customers well at her salon. Her earnings are a big help in both providing for her family's daily sustenance and sending her child to high school.\r\n\r\nMa. Nancy hopes to still grow and expand her business. She prays that God will continue to bless her with good health and long life until she will be able to send her child to college. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

He found himself hopeless and depressed by the event. This man who life gave an opportunity offering strength, hope, and the desire to progress, started a store in the rural part of Zancudo. <br \/><br \/>Since then he has worked between 12 and 14 hours per day not only to earn his sustenance but to progress. To have the biggest and most complete store in the area and chase the dream he once started with his wife of buying his own house. <br \/><br \/>Today he works very hard to achieve this. To continue to progress and have a large business he is integrating other services, generating employment and taking another step closer to his dream. <br \/><br \/>Luis wants to request a loan to invest in the following: buy 10 wooden game table; a 52 inch television so clients can watch football (soccer) in his store; adapt an area to start fast food sales (creating a job); buy a cooler to store refrigerated foods (creating a job); buy an assortment of frozen food like chicken, fish, cheese, sausage, and cold cuts in general. See how this amount not only brings progress to his business, generates employment, work that helps a lot in such a vulnerable and poor area such as Zancudo to get ahead through it's entrepreneurs."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1910093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a games table, a television and make improvements to the shop amongst others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Fredonia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2015-07-03T01:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-02T01:00:04Z","loan_amount":3075,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Octavio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":7800000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":3075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":907739,"name":"Maritel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maritel is a hardworking entrepreneur.

This is Tati, one of Ruma\u2019s agents. Tati lives in Tasikmalaya, a city in southeastern West Java, Indonesia located between Bandung and Purwokerto on the southerly of the two major road routes across Java. Tati is happily married and she and her husband have three children. Tati owns and manages a small stall that sells basic household products. She's excited to learn more about mobile technology from Ruma\u2019s mobile application. \r\n\r\nBy supporting this loan you will be providing extra working capital for Tati's shop. This will allow Tati to become an agent for Ruma\u2019s layaway product, Mapan, designed to assist lower-income communities. Mapan enables customers to save money little by little for larger purchases by depositing change with agents like Tati. As the balance grows, it allows customers to make major asset purchases like housewares, appliances, and school supplies for their children. \r\n\r\nAs a Mapan agent, Tati will process deposits from customers into their Mapan accounts. She will also receive orders from customers for products listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog. When a customer places an order, Tati will submit the order via SMS and the product is delivered to the customer within 5-10 days. Tati believes that Mapan provides her community access to higher-quality products at lower prices. \r\n\r\nTati is shown in the photo.

She carries out her business in the area 'Max Paredes' located northeast of the city. Commerce is the main activity there, reaching an economic flow of more than 500,000 dollars per day. The climate is cold and dry with a temperature that varies during the day from 0-12 degrees Celsius.  \r\n\r\nFrancisca is of dark complexion, with brown eyes and long black hair that she braids.

She shares her life with her husband who works in commerce and with her daughter who is independent. They live in their own house made of brick and cement with a corrugated metal roof and wood floor that has electricity, potable water, and a sewage system. \r\n\r\nHer business is the production of dry, salted foods like fava beans, peanuts, fried plantain, roasted corn, and other items. \"I started my business selling fava beans and corn; later I decided to produce my own products...\" she comments. The advantage of her business is that she is responsible for all of the production. The disadvantage is that she is missing a deep fryer for the production of fried plantains and fried potatoes. Her dream is to improve her business; she wants to accomplish buying a deep fryer. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 2 years that she has carried out this work. \r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Francisca is seeking a loan to buy a deep fryer to produce fried plantain and improve her business.

She also has a tricycle unit that her husband drives. The tricycle is a common form of transportation in towns like General Trias.  Few people have  their own cars and a tricycle is usually used for short-distance trips from their house to churches, to the town market, plaza or to their friend's house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.

Although there are competitors around her area, she makes sure that she always has the essential food items all the time to better serve her customers. Part of the loan she will use to buy another tricycle unit. Being in a busy commercial area, she sees the need to add one more unit of tricycle to serve more passengers. She is thanking God and you in advance, for the financial help that will be given her.<br \/> <br \/>Floricel dreams of having a big grocery store. Her simple dream is to see all her children go to college and become professionals someday.

Sara has display cases in her house where she shows off her products to the public. Once a week, Sara also goes out to sell her products and collect payments (Sara sells for both cash and on credit). Sara has been doing this work for two years.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy shirts, blouses, trousers and children's clothes.

She did not let her being separated from her husband prevent her from being a hardworking and loving mother. \r\n\r\nFlordeliza is grateful that God has blessed her with a general store for five years already. It has been her source of income to support their daily needs. She buys from wholesaler essential food items such as canned goods, coffee, biscuits, beverages, toiletries and sells them at retail price. She also sells snacks like fish balls and hamburgers to augment her income. Although there are days that sales is low she still maintains a positive attitude that she will earn more in other days.\r\n\r\nTo help her expand operations of her store she is requesting a Php 10000 loan to buy large quantities of grocery items to add to her store and beef patties, fish balls, oil, buns as well for her snacks business.  She is thanking God and you in advance for your good heart and the financial aid that will be given her. Her earnings is a big help to cover her and her daughter's daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nMa.

She does not allow poverty in the Philippines to hinder them from improving their lives. Aside from her small store she also has a tricycle unit which her husband drives. A tricycle carries around four passengers. In the Philippines, tricycle is a common means of transportation. Jeepneys and buses are limited in some areas. Very few people own a vehicle. The town people usually ride a tricycle from their homes  to market, church, to their friend\u2019s homes and to other destinations within their community. They even transport from one town to the other Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of Php 900 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business she is requesting a Php 50000 loan which she will use to buy large quantities of grocery items like canned goods, coffee, eggs, instant noodles, beverages etc. Part of the loan she will use to pay for the maintenance of her tricycle unit. It is important that her tricycle is always in good running condition to ensure efficient and safe service. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her since it will greatly help sustain their needs especially her children's educational needs.\r\n\r\nCherry's simple dream is to see her three children go to College and become professional someday. She aims to work harder to give her family the best in life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

With the received credit, Grigol will open a traditional Georgian bakery in his house and start baking bread.
