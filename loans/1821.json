Shelia\u2019s mortgage is the only debt she incurred; she does not use credit cards and will only seek financing when absolutely necessary. \r\n\r\nShelia has managed to maintain her home through the years; however, she desperately needs repairs to her roof. She has been very worried about the condition of the roof on her home because it is missing some shingles and has several leaks. Shelia loves her home, which is located close to her extended family, and she plans to live in the home for the rest of her life. Shelia is hoping that Solar and Energy Loan Fund (SELF) and Kiva can help her pay for a roof repair, which will eliminate mold growth due to water penetrating the drywall in her home. This will give Shelia peace of mind that her roof will not collapse on her due to the structure rotting. Not only will Shelia receive the necessary repairs to her roof, but she will also build a credit history as she repays her loan. \r\n\r\nShelia will use her Kiva loan to pay for necessary roof repairs to stop rain water from leaking into her home and to repair any structural damage."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":334.43,"image":{"id":1918565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Which classes do you enjoy the most?\r\nI am studying for a Bachelor of Business Administration. I enjoy mathematics classes the most. I enjoy the Financial Management class most because I get to learn how to run a business, bearing in mind the expenses to be incurred in order to generate income. With the background of the above mentioned, I can plan a strategy accordingly in order to be effective and efficient. \r\n\r\n2.\tWhat are your goals after graduating from the Maharishi Institute? In which sector do you expect to work? In which city would you like to work? Would you like to travel?\r\nI want to start my own consulting business in Johannesburg. I would like to travel. I would like to work in Johannesburg, however I am open to travelling and exploring other fields, as my mind is not fixed on a particular genre or sector. I was born in Pretoria and moved to Johannesburg 15 years ago in search of opportunities. For most of those years I found myself wondering and battling to survive, forced by circumstances to settle for odd jobs. When I heard about the Maharishi Institute I jumped in excitement. An opportunity I have longed for: to be educated. As things stand, I am struggling to cover living costs, including accommodation and my travels to and from the Institute. This is because I don't have a guardian or parent looking after me. On the contrary, I am the one that needs to feed two children and their mother, yet I am a student.\r\n\r\n3.\tWhat do you like to do in your spare time?\r\nIn my spare time I like to read novels, play soccer, or watch television. I work at night, so I don't really have spare time. I knock off at 2:00, go to bed around 3:00, and then I have to wake up at 5:30 to prepare for school, which starts at 8:00. I try so hard to sell the artworks I produce. However that is very difficult to achieve considering our economy.\r\n\r\n4.\tHow will a Kiva loan change your life? \r\nA Kiva loan will help me to invest most of my time towards my studies, rather than dividing my attention between studies and hustling to earn income. If granted this loan, I will not go to sleep late anymore, and therefore will be able to concentrate in class and not fall asleep during the lectures."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":16.33,"image":{"id":1918427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for one year of tuition fees and living expenses at the Maharishi Institute.

Since the age of 19 he has worked in the penitentiary system as a section head. In spite of having studied design and computer programming, every evening, this single father readies his uniform to go to work the next day in the penitentiary.  Dayton is a determined man who has been father and mother to a 14-year-old adolescent to whom he has been able to provide education, food and a roof with much love. His son is the most important thing in his life and for this reason he is asking for a loan to buy a toilet, lavatory sink, pipe, cement block, tiles and other construction materials to install sanitary facilities and to improve the quality of life of his child and himself. His dream is to see his son graduate, to continue with the construction of his house, to finish his own studies and dedicate himself to his chosen profession.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50.33,"image":{"id":1911069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to buy a toilet, lavatory, pipe, cement blocks, tile and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2015-07-03T14:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-02T14:30:07Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dayton Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":16.67,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":16.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711528553},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":16.67,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":16.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731044501},{"amount":16.99,"local_amount":16.99,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":16.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752133450}],"funded_date":"2015-07-04T12:51:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Randle","image":123871}},{"id":910689,"name":"Kellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kellen is a responsible and diligent smallholder farmer from Magumoni village who is involved in dairy, poultry, goat and tree farming.

Mariam is 18 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala region of Uganda. She has no children. For the past 2 years, Mariam has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar, salt, posho, rice, flour. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mariam has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

She currently works long hours to support her children, and to maintain her family\u2019s household. Garcia unfortunately suffered a health related setback that left her confined to a hospital bed for a period of months, and during this time she was unable to work. \r\n\r\nDue to her strong work ethic, she was able to return to her job; however, she fell behind on their bills and has experienced a long financial struggle. Garcia has worked very hard to catch up as well as pay for her medical bills. She is currently in a much better position to maintain her family\u2019s expenses. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, during her time of financial struggle, she was forced to set aside her plans to make necessary repairs to their home. Garcia desperately needs a new roof due to a very large leak that has developed and is currently pouring large amounts of water into the home with every passing storm. Garcia has noticed that the home is beginning to develop mold, and she absolutely does not want her children living in a home that could possibly make them ill. She is also worried that her roof is going to cave in on her and the children due to the rotting of wood that is meant to provide structural integrity to the family\u2019s roof. \r\n\r\nGarcia realizes that SELF and Kiva is her last hope of obtaining a new roof for her home to provide a healthy and safe environment for her children.

The women heard about Namaste through fliers the foundation had placed in the municipal market.

Her group is pleased that they are available on a payment plan that makes them much more affordable. \r\n<p>\r\nWith the use of these filters Vanhthong\u2019s family should see a substantial decrease in illness and associated medical costs. Significantly, she and others will be able to shift their time to other pursuits.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1918249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to buy a TerraClear water filter that will give her family safe and pure water to drink.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LA","country":"Lao PDR","town":"Laos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":393,"posted_date":"2015-07-03T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-02T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vanhthong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phengsee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanheuang","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanhtee","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seephong","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phimpha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bouamee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lieng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Douangphone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thong","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khankham","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chame","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khanhthavee","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mone","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phao","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lai","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Souphanh","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nouandee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LAK","disbursal_amount":15000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-07-08T18:29:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Pierce","image":518671}},{"id":911056,"name":"Hatkhai Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Champee and his group, along with other villagers, participated in a village meeting where they discussed the costs of treating local water supplies.

The income she gets from the store helps them for their daily expenditures. \r\n\r\nHowever, what profits she gets from the business is sometimes insufficient. It is because at times, she finds it hard to maintain supplies of various products due to financial incapability.

With more products displayed in her store, she can ably have greater increase in her income. \r\n\r\nIn due time, she hopes that she grow in progress and that her business will boost in sales. Through this, she can earn and save money for her dream to have her own grocery store if God will allow someday.

He used his profits to cover school fees for his son, provide for family needs, and reinvest in his business. \r\n\r\nMusa will invest part of this new credit to put electricity in one of his houses for renting. He will share this loan with his group, Tupendane B, consisting of two men who will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

They live in the home Hilda owns, which is built of wood with an iron roof and earth floor. The house has electricity and has water from a well, which is extracted through a pump. \r\nThey live in a remote, rural area where they are currently installing a public water system. Hilda says \"in this place we have never had drinkable water, and I would like it if my granddaughter could grow up in better conditions\". The advantage of their area is that they have access to drinkable water, the disadvantage is that she lacks the money to bring this water into her kitchen, bathroom and washroom. \r\nHilda's dream is to have plumbing in her home, and she wants to install it in the kitchen, bathroom and washroom so that her granddaughter no longer has to drink dirty water from the well.

She is a good mother, enterprising, patient, a good listener, supportive, responsible and very hardworking. She runs her business in the Mutualista area which is very much in demand by those who want to have a a store like hers or any type of business. She works opposite the Mutualista market which is visited by many buyers from the whole city. The temperature of the warm subtropical climate varies from 21 to 35 degrees Celsius during the day. \r\n\r\nKarina has dark skin, brown eyes and long black hair which she ties up. She is short in stature and slight in build. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks with her family, speaking Spanish in general and for the business she runs. She shares her life with her baby who is one year old and is starting to walk. They live in a rented room which is made out of bricks and cement and has a corrugated iron roof, drinking water, electricity and a sewrage system.\r\n\r\nKarina works selling empanadas. They are typically filled with meat and onion and are usually eaten hot first thing in the morning. Her daily routine starts at 7 in the morning when she can be found on the street pushing her two wheeled cart carrying two baskets which are covered and wrapped in paper so that the contents don't get cold, since her customers are used to eating them hot. Once she gets to her workplace she patiently waits for her customers to arrive. A few hours later all of her food runs out. \u201cI sell my empanadas daily and I also want to start selling desserts\", Karen says. The advantage of her business is that she has loyal customers who have become accustomed to eating her empanadas every day. The disadvantage is that she lacks the capital to buy ingredients to increase her product range. \r\n\r\nKarina's dream is to open a store where she can sell all kinds of empanadas. She would like to buy ingredients such as flour, milk, eggs, yeast, cheese, etc. to increase the amount she produces and attract more customers. This is the first loan cycle she has entered into with the institution in the one year that she has been working in this area. It is for this reason that Karina is applying for a loan to buy ingredients to make empanadas and open an empanada store."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":613.98,"image":{"id":1911739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to make empanadas and open an empanada store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-04T07:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-03T07:30:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-23T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T04:00:00Z","amount":792.31},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T04:00:00Z","amount":776.41},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T04:00:00Z","amount":794.82},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T04:00:00Z","amount":846.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T04:00:00Z","amount":879.18},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T04:00:00Z","amount":910.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.85},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.04},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":235.31,"local_amount":1568.72,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1621.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554891},{"amount":119.22,"local_amount":794.82,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":821.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468975},{"amount":127.04,"local_amount":846.92,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:36Z","rounded_local_amount":875.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296807},{"amount":132.41,"local_amount":882.75,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":912.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076960}],"funded_date":"2015-07-10T20:55:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Grasso","image":357930}},{"id":911231,"name":"Elvira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvira is 48 years old and married with six children.

Her family is composed of her, her husband and two children. \r\n\r\nIn the Nkubu area of Kenya, where Lucy hails from, the population depends on agriculture for a living. The people there live and work on small farms. The major challenge is that there is a huge deficit in access to agricultural inputs, meaning that yields and incomes for farmers in Nkubu are far below what they could be. \r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo partnered with Kiva to increase access to financial services to smallholders around Kenya. Through this partnership, Lucy is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs such as seeds, fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides. Your loan will enable her to increase her production and fill the increasing demand for food. In the process, she will generate more income to repay the loan debt and elevate the quality of life for her family. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":257.92,"image":{"id":1919294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farm inputs such as seeds, fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-04T08:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-03T08:10:11Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":95000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5136.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5287.04},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5441.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5600.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5764.26},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5932.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":6106.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":6284.56},{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":6468.22},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":6657.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":6851.81},{"due_date":"2016-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":7052.06},{"due_date":"2016-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":7258.15},{"due_date":"2016-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":7470.27},{"due_date":"2016-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":7688.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.26},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.89},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.38},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.32},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.32},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.38},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.49},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.67},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.46,"local_amount":10665.07,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":10881.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506893},{"amount":58.5,"local_amount":5699.62,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5815.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023751},{"amount":89.96,"local_amount":8765.53,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:41Z","rounded_local_amount":8943.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111848}],"funded_date":"2015-08-02T00:16:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shilpa Pullela","image":1721739}},{"id":911243,"name":"Emelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emelia is married and works hard to support her family.
