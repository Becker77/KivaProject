She operates her business by traveling throughout the area 'Mutualista', a centrally-located area known for the camb\u00f3dromo, which is a space with a capacity to fit 30,000 people. In this area, carnivals, parades, and other cultural activities take place. The climate here is warm and sub-tropical with a temperature that varies between 21-35 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n\r\nMercedes has light brown skin, brown eyes, and long brown hair that she wears tied up. She is short in stature, with a robust physique. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family. She also speaks Spanish for general purposes and in her business (she is the first on the right in the photo, with a light blue polo and white shorts). She enjoys life in the company of her family that works. They live in their own room made of brick and cement, and it has potable water, electricity, and a sewage system. The need to expand her business has motivated her to form a group with other people in businesses such as: ceramic crafts, natural product sales, a key-making shop, a welding shop, cosmetic sales, a beauty salon, and food sales. This group's purpose is to request a loan together and improve their businesses. \r\n\r\nMercedes's business is painting on canvas, which is one of the simplest manual activities, but at the same time gives great results. Her specialties are the portraits of famous people such as artists or famous paintings such as the Mona Lisa. \"The reality is that it is not necessary to have great technique or pictorial qualities to get nice designs...\" she says. The benefit of her business is that she does her work by request. The drawback is her lack of capital to be able to invest and and improve her sales. Her dream is to open a sales shop with a roof. She would like to invest in her business by buying canvas painting supplies such as paint, paint brushes, canvas, and other items. This is her 3rd cycle of loans with the institution in the 5 years she has been doing this work.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Mercedes is requesting a loan to buy canvas painting supplies to open a sales shop with a roof."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2104.3,"image":{"id":1911759,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy canvas painting supplies to open a sales shop with a roof.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-04T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-03T14:40:01Z","loan_amount":4650,"lender_count":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mery Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Urbano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Micaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlos Javier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katherin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-23T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":32000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-06T04:00:00Z","amount":2997.89},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T04:00:00Z","amount":3697.21},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T04:00:00Z","amount":3742.71},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T04:00:00Z","amount":4043.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T04:00:00Z","amount":4122.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T04:00:00Z","amount":4271},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T04:00:00Z","amount":4484.26},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T04:00:00Z","amount":4641.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":543.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":587.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":599.02},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":620.63},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":651.62},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":674.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":435.63,"local_amount":2997.89,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3001.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554892},{"amount":537.25,"local_amount":3697.21,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3701.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468976},{"amount":543.86,"local_amount":3742.71,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3747.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296808},{"amount":587.56,"local_amount":4043.43,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4048.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076961}],"funded_date":"2015-07-21T20:40:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christopher Redmond","image":null}},{"id":906150,"name":"Blanca Nieve Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo solidario Blanca Nieves est\u00e1 conformado por cinco mujeres emprendedoras, coordinado por Humbelina de 53 a\u00f1os de edad, quien es propietaria de una pulper\u00eda desde hace cinco a\u00f1os.

That's why she really helps her husband in finding out ways to earn an income.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Teresita was given a chance to borrow a loan that she used to improve her small sari-sari store. She is indeed thankful to have you a part of her business as helping hands. This time, she wants to take a loan again that she would utilize in buying grocery items to sell in larger quantities. She truly hopes that you grant this request. A 32,000 PHP loan would become a big help for her family. \r\n\r\nSomeday, Teresita wants her children have good lives but they can't acquire this in just a snap.

Her eldest daughter, Sitora, is 14 years old and attends school. Her middle daughter, Begaim, is 7 years old and attends kindergarten. The youngest son, Azis, is one year old. Sohiba is divorced. She is an independent, goal-driven person and likes her business to be well organized and efficiently run. Sohiba has earned two college degrees. For 15 years she has been in private business, providing  hair styling services (hair cuts, women's hair styling) and cosmetic services (facials, tatoos etc). She has all the necessary education. Her beauty salon is open from 8 AM to 9 PM. Her monthly revenue is about 17,200 soms (KGS).\r\n\r\nHowever, Sohiba is not used to resting on her laurels. She constantly attempts to expand her knowledge and skills by participating in seminars and forums. In May of 2015, Sohiba has received training in business planning within the framework of the competition \"Launch your own business,\" which was conducted in the southern regions of Kyrgyzstan. Sohiba was one of the 35 finalists and one of the 9 participants who were eventually offered a business launch loan under preferential conditions from the Bai Tushum microfinance institution. \r\n\r\nSohiba gladly accepted this opportunity since her longtime dream  has been to start a new direction in her business--teaching professional development courses. Sohiba will teach some of the courses herself and also hire qualified instructors. There will be courses offered in the following areas: hairdressing, languages, cooking, sewing, computer literacy, and bookkeeping. Sohiba has already leased the necessary space. She will plan to use her loan of 150,000 soms (KGS) to buy 10 PCs, 10 computer desks, one projector and two printers. There will be 8-10 students in each student group. Each week Sohiba plans to have at least two groups. Individual courses will also be available upon request. Sohiba decided to set affordable prices: for example, one 3-month course in bookkeeping will cost 4,500, which is an attractive price for young professionals. \r\n\r\nSohiba uses every opportunity to develop her business or start something new, with her main goal being to increase her income and provide a decent quality of life and the best education for her children. Her additional business ideas involve purchasing her own business space and opening a private kindergarten. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":591.46,"image":{"id":1921603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to start a new business -- specialized education courses -- by purchasing 10 computers, 10 desks, one projector and two printers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Osh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-07-04T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-03T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.42,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sohiba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12539},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11821},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11968},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":12118},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":12270},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":12423},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":12578},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12735},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12895},{"due_date":"2016-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13056},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13219},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12378}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.71},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.91},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.37},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200.84},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.34},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.88},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.47},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.07},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.71},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":206.76,"local_amount":12789,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":12841.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711412010},{"amount":190.45,"local_amount":11824,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-18T12:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":11872.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.7,"payment_id":730934226},{"amount":183.83,"local_amount":11972,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:08:20Z","rounded_local_amount":12021.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.72,"payment_id":752026323}],"funded_date":"2015-07-06T11:19:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":911074,"name":"Dongwaydin Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khai\u2019s village sources much of their drinking water from local wells, streams, and collected rainwater.

Purchase of these solar-powered lights will give the families productive hours after sunset, including light by which their children can study and do their homework.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":165.25,"image":{"id":1919663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to purchase solar systems to light their houses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Takinta, Ocosingo, Chiapas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":275,"posted_date":"2015-07-05T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-04T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felix Andres ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6757,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":563.08},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":563.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":563.08},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":563.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":563.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":563.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":563.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":563.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":563.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":563.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":563.08},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":563.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.37,"local_amount":651.16,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":682.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696556258},{"amount":79.92,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1257.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711470576},{"amount":41.96,"local_amount":630,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":660.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752078659}],"funded_date":"2015-07-10T15:57:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Pierce","image":518671}},{"id":911501,"name":"Sergei","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sergei is married with one child.

De clima c\u00e1lido sub tropical con una temperatura que var\u00eda durante el d\u00eda entre 21-35 grados cent\u00edgrados.\nEustaquia es de tez morena, ojos pardos, cabello negro largo lo usa trenzado, baja estatura, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica robusta, su lengua materna es el Guaran\u00ed que se habla en el lugar y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y por el negocio que desarrolla (al centro, viste blusa beige, su\u00e9ter azul y pollera). Su vida la disfruta en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus familiares que trabajan, viven en un cuarto propio construido de ladrillo y cemento con techo de calamina y piso de cemento que cuenta con agua potable, energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y alcantarillado. La necesidad por mejorar sus ingresos la llev\u00f3 a formar una banca de personas con negocios como; taller mec\u00e1nico, cerrajer\u00eda, tejido de ropa de beb\u00e9, artesan\u00eda en cer\u00e1mica y venta de productos naturales, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y mejorar sus actividades.

Su sue\u00f1o es ampliar su puesto de comida, ella desea invertir en su negocio mediante la compra de una heladera d\u00f3nde conservar los alimentos frescos. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 10 a\u00f1os que desarrolla esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Eustaquia solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de una heladera para aumentar la oferta y vender m\u00e1s comida\n","en":"Eustaquia is a 57-year-old woman who is a widow, has 4 independent children, and sells food for a living.  She's an entrepreneur, patient, listens well, is supportive, resilient, responsible and very hardworking.  She runs her business in the town of Cotoca which is located 20 kilometers to the east of the city.  It's known for a variety of traditional food as well as its patronage festival where believers go around on foot.  It has a hot subtropical climate with a temperature that varies from 21-35 degrees Celsius during the day.  \r\n\r\nEustaquia has a brown complexion, brown eyes, long, black hair which she keeps in a braid, is of short stature, has a robust physique, and speaks Guarani as her native language.  She speaks Spanish due to the general culture as well as needing it to run her business.  She's in the center of the picture, and is wearing a beige blouse with a blue sweater and a skirt.  \r\n\r\nShe enjoys her life in the company of her family members who work.  They live in a room of their own made with bricks and cement, a roof of corrugated iron and a cement floor, with potable water, electricity and access to a sewer system.  The need to increase their income has led them to form a group of people with businesses such as a mechanic's garage, a locksmith's shop, knitting clothing for babies, making ceramic handicrafts and selling natural products, all in order to request a loan and improve their businesses.  Her business is selling food such as majao (ground jerky, boiled bananas and rice), peanut soup (soup with a peanut base), stuffed locotos (locoto peppers, meat with spices, onions), rice with cheese (rice, milk and cheese), aj\u00ed de panza (tripe, onions, and tomatoes accompanied with rice), and others.  \"The food is sold every day, and the climate in the area makes the food spoil quicker,\" she says.  \"That's why I need a refrigerator.\"\r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that the food is sold constantly.  The disadvantage is that she lacks the money to buy a refrigerator to keep her food cold.  Her dream is to expand the place she sells her food from.  She wants to invest in her business by buying a refrigerator where she can keep her fresh food.  This is the 1st sequence of loans with the institution in 10 years that's developing this business.  These are the reasons why Eustaquia is requesting a loan to buy a refrigerator, expand her offering and sell more food."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":1912871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy a refrigerator to expand her offering and sell more food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-05T08:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-04T08:30:02Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eustaquia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alvaro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herbin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-25T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-08T04:00:00Z","amount":1355.91},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T04:00:00Z","amount":1358.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T04:00:00Z","amount":1425.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T04:00:00Z","amount":1431.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T04:00:00Z","amount":1457.31},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T04:00:00Z","amount":1483.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-31T04:00:00Z","amount":1510.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T04:00:00Z","amount":1538.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T04:00:00Z","amount":1566.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":1594.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T04:00:00Z","amount":1623.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T04:00:00Z","amount":1653.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.18},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.73},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.53},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.42},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":812.49,"local_amount":5571.31,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5605.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554894},{"amount":649.25,"local_amount":4451.98,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4479.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468978},{"amount":452.76,"local_amount":3104.67,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3123.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296810},{"amount":710.5,"local_amount":4872.04,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4902.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076963}],"funded_date":"2015-07-18T17:21:56Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":909759,"name":"Bataillon 1 & 3 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Alex est  le coordonateur de son groupe Bataillon 1 & 3.

The key to a smooth and consistent service is the regular maintenance of her vehicle.

He is married and has 3 children who are all currently in school. For the past 7 years, Godfrey has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells saucepans,kettles,frying pans. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Godfrey has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

She has 11 brothers and sisters, and it was difficult for her parents to give them what they needed because of the economic situation they were in. For that reason, she started helping her mother with domestic tasks at a very young age. Now she is in a relationship and her partner is a farmer.\r\nMar\u00eda has spent her time sowing basic grains like maize and beans since she has been in the relationship, as her partner taught her the work as a source of income to sustain the family. As well as working with her own crops, Mar\u00eda also sells snacks to help her partner with the expenses at home. To get to her crops she has to walk 1 kilometer from her home and her son and partner help with the work.\r\nThe loan will be used to buy manure, seed and pesticides for her cultivation of maize and beans. This time she will introduce a new variety of seed, with which she hopes for better harvests.\r\nMar\u00eda wants to widen her cultivation in the future by leasing more land and thereby being able to give her family a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1909876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy manure, seed and pesticides for her cultivation of maize and beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Vicente","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.516667 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-07-05T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-04T14:10:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:58:08Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711455362}],"funded_date":"2015-07-06T08:39:44Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:58:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susie Jackson","image":null}},{"id":911674,"name":"Basilisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Basilisa is 66 years old, married and has one child.\r\n\r\nBasilisa is in the agricultural business, fattening pigs in the Philippines.

Anwar requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so that he would be able to buy one buffalo for producing more milk to sell.\r\n\r\nM.
