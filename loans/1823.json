She is a married woman. She has a business selling animals. She buys animals (baby goats and calves) at low prices, brings them up, and then sells them out in the market at higher prices. She makes enough through her business to contribute to the family income.

She has two children who are 3 and 5 years old and her occupation is transportation. She is a good mother, has a good attitude  and is optimistic, happy, committed to her work, responsible,  and hard-working. She works in the Chasquipampa region which is known as an ancient stop for the Chaskis (Inca runners during the Inca Imperial times), and Inca tombs, ceramics and gold pieces from the period are found here.

They live in a rented room built of brick and cement with a tin roof and a wooden floor. It has electricity, drinking water and sewerage.\r\n\r\nHer business is transportation such as taxi driving. She learned how to drive because her father taught her, and she currently has one car but it is in bad shape. Her work allows her to be independent and to pay her children's expenses. \"My work schedule is flexible and gives me time to take care of my children, and I earn income every day so I can pay each day's expenses...\" she states. These are the advantages of her work. The disadvantage is that there is not enough money for her to buy a new engine so she can continue with her work. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own house with a garage for her car. She wants to be able to buy an engine for the car to keep working and paying her children's expenses.

It has a cold and dry climate with a temperature which changes during the day between 0-12 degrees centigrade. \r\nPaola is brown-skinned, has dark eyes, long black hair which she ties behind her neck, low height, and a slim physique. Her mother tongue is Aymara, which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish as general culture and because of her business. She shares her life with her daughter, who goes to school. They live in a rented room made of adobe with a calamine roof and wooden flooring, which has electricity, potable water, and a sewage system. Her business is the sale of shoes by catalog under the system of direct sales, without fixed schedules or bosses, with a payments system, \u201ccurrently, traditional work does not allow to simultaneously do other activities, but direct sales allows me to enjoy time with the people I love\u2026\u201d she says. Next to her occupation of shoe sales, she works as a cashier at a bank, working from 9 to 5. The advantage of her business is that she can do it in her free time and does not interfere with her cashier work. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to invest in her business. She wants to do the shoe sales to increase her capital and improve her sales. This is her first sequence of loans with the institution in 2 years of having this occupation. \r\nIt is for these reasons that Paola asks for a loan, for the purchase of shoes by catalog to increase her working capital and take care of her daughter. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1913879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy shoes by catalog, increase her working capital, and take care of her daughter.

Arthur is married and has a beautiful set of twins under his care.   When they are older, he wants them to get a good education and lack nothing.  \r\nThe production of organic honey is a very sustainable activity in the area since climactic conditions are perfect and the large number of plants makes production abundant; also organic certification guarantees a good market by means of COCAFAL, of which Arthur is a member.\r\n\r\nArthur is asking for a loan now to be able to support his hives in the rainy season. (There is no production of honey so that it's necessary to give them food of an organic origin).

The members all have businesses selling different products, including: groceries, meals, sports clothing and cakes.\r\n\r\nThis loan will benefit small businesses in Delia's group. Delia herself says that she joined Pro Mujer following an invitation from a friend who was already a borrower. Delia currently has a business selling groceries and says that she started it under her own initiative with the few savings she had.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to increase capital at Delia's business by buying oil, pasta and sugar in bulk. Delia will buy these goods from sellers in El Alto, and then sell the goods at her own business. This work allows Delia to earn an income to support her family financially. Delia is single and has seven children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Delia says that she likes the health training offered by the organisation.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2360.45,"image":{"id":1913934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy oil, pasta and sugar in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:01Z","loan_amount":2925,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebeca Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pilar Lucero","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna Lisethe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marylin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":20076,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2853.16},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3204.28},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3290.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3380.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3473.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3874.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":466.85},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.42},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":492.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":506.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":564.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":415.69,"local_amount":2853.16,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:11:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2868.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696565978},{"amount":466.85,"local_amount":3204.28,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3221.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711481918},{"amount":479.42,"local_amount":3290.52,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731000442},{"amount":998.49,"local_amount":6853.2,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":6889.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752088679}],"funded_date":"2015-07-19T19:22:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":911892,"name":"Charita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of one child, Charita works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a food processing business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from her general store.

The difference between the two costs will be the entrepreneur\u2019s profit. The products may range from cheap rags to expensive condominiums or house and lot, depending on the entrepreneur\u2019s capital. \r\n\r\nOdel, 48, is doing buy-and-sell of various products such as cellphones, kitchen wares and cooking sets, electric fans, and other appliances. He has contact manufacturers and dealers from whom he can get the products in lower prices. He will then sell the products directly to his friends, neighbors, relatives and other network. To his advantage, he chooses the products that do not decay or rot. But the disadvantage is, his chosen products are expensive thus it requires a higher capital. Now that he plans to buy more items for sale, he would like to borrow supplementary capital amounting to PhP 50,000. He will add items like dining tables, chairs and flat screen TV's. He already has target buyers for these, so hopefully his request will be granted soon.\r\n\r\nOdel is married to Flora and they are living in Caloocan City.

They live in the city of Bilwi and they got together 12 months ago with the purpose of working in a supportive way to be able to have access to loans in Pana Pana, which will allow them to increase the inventory in their small business, increase their income, and so little by little improve the conditions of life of their families. \r\n\r\nJose Roberto: he is a young man who is 23 years old, coordinator of the supportive group, with dreams of improvement and leadership qualities, and married. His wife works in retail. Due to the lack of formal employment, for the last 5 years he has sold new clothing in his section in one of the markets of Bilwi, with the goal of having his source of income and contribute to household expenses. He is asking for his third financing to buy in Managua: purses, wallets, among other products, and sell them at a good price to his clients in Bilwi and in this way improve his income. His dream is to diversify his products. The two previous loans given by Pana Pana and financed by Kiva, allowed the three members of the supportive group to increase their product inventory. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1910460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy wallets and purses, among other products. \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Bilwi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":328,"posted_date":"2015-07-06T11:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-05T11:50:05Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika Roxana Agu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prudencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":14600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1042.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1042.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1042.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1042.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1042.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1042.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1042.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1042.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1042.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1042.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1042.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1042.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1042.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1042.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":393.91,"local_amount":10456.62,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:39:09Z","rounded_local_amount":10718.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696722206},{"amount":156.09,"local_amount":4143.38,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T18:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4247.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711653777}],"funded_date":"2015-07-06T18:10:45Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T18:15:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Orozco","image":551274}},{"id":912127,"name":"Hadija","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hadija is a married woman with three children, all of whom attend school.

He is a hardworking man who has been a public transportation driver for more than twenty-five years. This allows him to get his family ahead. Atilio lives in a house he has owned for several years with his 6 year old grandson and his 27 year old daughter, who works at a nearby school as a teacher. For some time, Atilio has wanted to build a bathroom in his home with indoor plumbing, since the one he has now doesn't offer much sanitation because it is a dry toilet system.

Maydielyn, 25, is a single parent who has learned to give up her former unpleasant lifestyle through the guidance of God and her co-fellowship* members at CCT Credit Cooperative in Caloocan City. She managed to turn her old habits into productive ways of income generation. She now has RTW business that sells pants, shirts, blouses, skirts, undergarments, and other ready-to-wear apparels. The income derived from her business sustains her and her child\u2019s everyday needs. It\u2019s challenging for her to manage her household and business simultaneously, but her child serves as her daily motivation. \r\n\r\nMaydielyn normally experiences stiff competition in business, but she focuses on her goal to provide for her child\u2019s needs and send her to a reputable school someday. This goal fuels her to expand her business by making it more enticing to customers. She plans to buy more up-to-date clothes and add sweaters or jackets in time for the rainy season. She needs additional capital worth PhP 8,000 to buy these items so she can gain extra profit and savings. As much as possible, she desires to prepare early for her child\u2019s future and guide her towards the right path.
