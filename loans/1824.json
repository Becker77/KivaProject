Her regular customers are her neighbors, the local community, students, and working people.

She\u2019s planning to cook more meal recipes now that the school year has begun. More students are expected to buy from her and it will boost her income. She needs 10,000 PHP to buy meat, fish, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. You can be a blessing to her through your kind generosity.\r\n\r\nLilibeth aspires that someday, she would be financially capable of helping others. She also wants to continue serving God together with her whole family.

He is 20 years old, a resident of Silang, Cavite Province, in the Philippines. To earn a living and fulfill his responsibilities to his life partner, he decided to provide tricycle transportation services. A responsible young man, he aims to keep his promise to work hard for the family\u2019s future. Albert has been operating a tricycle for two years. His tricycle will carry up to four passengers. \r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, especially in places like Silang, the tricycle is a common means of transportation. Jeepneys (a special form of collective transportation vehicle in the Philippines) and buses are limited. Very few people own vehicles. The townspeople usually ride a tricycle from their homes to market, to church, to their friends\u2019 homes and to other destinations within their community. They even provide transport services between towns.  \r\n\r\nAlbert humbly asks for financial assistance in the form of a PHP 8,000 loan to pay for his tricycle maintenance. It is important that his unit always be in good running condition, to ensure efficient service and a steady income. He is thanks God, and you, in advance for your support, as this will help him sustain his service and earn a living. Albert plans to acquire another tricycle unit to grow his transportation business. He prays for God's mercy in all his trips and asks for prosperity in all his endeavors. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week, where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro-Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1920904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay for maintenance on the tricycle he uses to provide transportation services.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-06T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-05T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.35,"local_amount":3733.31,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4213.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523551},{"amount":39.99,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1805.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433979},{"amount":53.32,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2407.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954898},{"amount":13.34,"local_amount":533.38,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":601.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044757}],"funded_date":"2015-07-06T22:37:12Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tony Gooch","image":970369}},{"id":912439,"name":"Gemma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gemma is 48 years old, married, and has three children who are in school.

Four of them are grown-up and two are still in school. Joyce has been buying big stones and making them into small quarrying stones for two years now. She does not have a specific time for working: whenever the big stones are found, they call her and she goes to collect the stones and start making them in small quarries. She has been able to make a good monthly profit.\n\nThis will be Joyce's forth loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.  She used the previous loans to increase on the load of tones twice, and has paid back all her loans successfully. She used the profit to buy more loans and has managed to pay back all her loans successfully.

her husband and children. Her husband is a farmer. Unable to sustain the needs of the family with only her husband\u2019s income, she has found ways to attain income through growing vegetables.

4 children of school and pre-school age. She has a secondary education. In search of a source of income for her family, Sveta began her field and animal husbandry business in 2003. Thanks to her very hard work, her farm now has 2 cows, 10 sheep, and 2 horses. She grows barley on a 0.31 hectare plot of land.\r\n\r\nSeeing a good source of income in agriculture, Sveta has applied to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy cows to put to pasture and fatten up. Sveta plans to invest the proceeds from her loan in the further improvement of her farm, which will allow her to buy some

","en":"Nematullo, age 25, is a young businessman from the Hamadoni district of Tajikistan.  He lives with his father, mother, wife and children.  His father is 50,  his mom 48.  His wife is 21 years old.  Nematullo owns a small animal-husbandry business.  He raises cattle and has his own barn.  He has learned his business, and how to take care of animals, over the past two years.  He buys cattle and feeds them for a few months before selling them again at the cattle market.  At the moment, as you can see in the photo, he only has a small number of animals.  Nematullo therefore wants to increase his cattle headcount and expand his business.  However, he needs money to do so, which is the reason why he is taking a loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":66.67,"image":{"id":1925293,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to increase his cattle headcount and expand his business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Hamadoni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-07-07T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-06T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nematullo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":127.63},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":138.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":144.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":147.95},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":156.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":157.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":170.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":177.77},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":180.59},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":192.08},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":199.2},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":207.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.43},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.04},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.39},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.58},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.89},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.35},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.21},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.37},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.74,"local_amount":127.63,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:32:42Z","rounded_local_amount":129.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711526333},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":138.44,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":140.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731042100},{"amount":23.43,"local_amount":144.17,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":146.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752131066}],"funded_date":"2015-07-21T23:03:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":912604,"name":"Fridah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fridah is a married woman with three children.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She already acquired several loans, for capital which she used for her business. She never failed to repay all her amounts due on time. She succeeded in improving their way of life, through her investments.<br \/><br \/>For years now, she has engaged in direct-selling business. Most of her relatives, friends and neighbors are purchasing the direct selling products that she sells. In addition to the fact that they know her well, she has given them reasonable discounts so they will choose to order more items. The items she sells range from clothing, footwear and undergarments, to cosmetic products and others, of the popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, Dakki, etc. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer, and then delivered to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The prices dealers pay are lower than those in the catalog, and the difference is the profit that the dealers are earning as their income. She earns a minimum of Php 3000 in sales, every week.<br \/><br \/>To improve her sales and profit, she is asking her ever-generous lenders for a loan amounting to Php 30,000. She will be buying more merchandise products, which she needs in her business. She will also use her loan to buy more frozen goods, like hot dogs, meatloaf, nuggets, and similar products.<br \/><br \/>Judyline hopes to have a peaceful and happy life, together with her family. She aims someday to own and manage a bigger business, which would help her cope with their daily needs and expenses. She meets with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her life and business, and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She lives with her husband and two children. They are farmers with many years of experience behind them. Qrestina and her husband keep three cows, and 10 hens. They also cultivate haricot beans and greens and sell the produce in the market. This family is nice and hard-working and they have never avoided the difficulties that are in the agricultural sector. \r\n\r\nWishing to enlarge their farm, Qrestina is asking for this loan to  purchase  two calves and  build a small barn for the cattle. \r\n\r\n As this is Qrestina's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn't have access to credit products before because they have no credit history. Through this joint initiative, almost 500 borrowers like Qrestina get a chance to have their first loans and develop their businesses. Assuring responsible monthly payments of the loan, Qrestina and her husband hope for lenders' support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":155,"image":{"id":1921239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for two calves and  build a small barn for the cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Khachpar village, Ararat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2015-07-07T15:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-06T15:50:08Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Qrestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":43.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":37.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":38.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":38.47},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":39.43},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":39.82},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":40.92},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":40.94},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":41.39},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":42.02},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":43.21},{"due_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":43.26},{"due_date":"2016-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":43.62},{"due_date":"2017-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":44.41},{"due_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":44.7},{"due_date":"2017-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":45.39},{"due_date":"2017-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":45.7},{"due_date":"2017-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":46.24},{"due_date":"2017-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":46.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.61},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.47},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.43},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.82},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.92},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.94},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.39},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.02},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.21},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.26},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.62},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.41},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.7},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.39},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.7},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.24},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81,"local_amount":81,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-28T12:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696727158},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-23T12:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731163009}],"funded_date":"2015-07-27T00:57:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":912673,"name":"Thank You Jesus Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliana is 46 years old.
