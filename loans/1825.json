Life is not easy for them but Belardo tries his best to provide for his family's needs.\r\n\r\nBelardo has operated a tricycle for four years already. His tricycle carries up to four passengers. In the Philippines, especially in the provinces like Silang, tricycle is a common means of transportation. Jeepneys and buses are limited. Very few people own a vehicle. The townpeople usually ride a tricycle from their homes to market, church, to their friend\u2019s homes and to other destinations within their community. They even transport from one town to the other. \r\n\r\nHe is humbly asking your financial assistance of a 12,000 PHP loan to pay for the maintenance of his tricycle. He wants to ensure safe and continuous service of his tricycle. He values his transportation business since his tricycle service is his sole means of living. He is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help. His earnings will surely cover their daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nBelardo dreams to be successful in his business and aims to buy one more tricycle. He prays for an abundant life. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week and this is where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":217.74,"image":{"id":1921307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay for the maintenance of his tricycle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-07T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-06T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belardo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.22,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3617.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523556},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1550.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433984},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2066.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954903},{"amount":57.3,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044760}],"funded_date":"2015-07-21T12:37:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":912724,"name":"Arevik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arevik is engaged in writing thesis papers, term papers and other kinds of papers in Kapan town.\r\n\r\nShe lives together with her parents and 18-year-old brother.

The department is named after them. \r\nSeven dedicated businesswomen have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank's Shalom Group, meaning peace.  The majority of them are involved in commercial ventures selling cosmetics, clothing and snacks. Another sells shoes through a catalog. \r\nMar\u00eda is the 57-year-old president of the Trust Bank group. She has seven children. She has a winning positive attitude and leadership skills. She sells drinks inside the local market as well as snacks. She is requesting a loan to purchase corn, vegetables, lemons and fruit for her menus, as well as cups, plates and plastic glasses. Her ultimate goal is to save enough of her earnings to build a house. All of her children are in various levels of schooling and she wants to have enough available funds for their continued education.\r\nThe Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge, combining loans and education, is most important for these women. At their monthly meetings, they learn about many topics from a Friendship Bridge facilitator that are very useful in their lives.

Most of the population is indigenous Kaqchikel Maya. Kaqchikel is commonly heard although Spanish is widely understood. Fishing and subsistence agriculture are the way most of the population survives with a growing market for tourism. The traditional outfits or \u201ctraje\u201d of the women is most distinctive with their beautiful blue and green patterned \u201chuipiles\u201d or blouses and ornate wrapped head dresses.\r\n\r\nEight active and hard-working women, who form the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank Flor del Lago Santa Catarina Group are requesting their second loan that they hope will be financed by Kiva investors. Virginia, a 47 year old mother of eight children, has a handicraft and jewelry business. She creates shawls, scarves, hats and traditional pieces of clothing like \u201chuipiles\u201d or blouses, as well as \u201cfajas\u201d or belts. She also fabricates many lovely items made of beads like coin purses, earrings, bracelets and necklaces. Her short-term goal is to open another business that would be a convenience store. Her next loan should enable her to save up enough to make this dream a reality.  Virginia is requesting a loan that she will use to buy supplies for her jewelry and textile businesses.\r\n\r\nVirginia and her friends in the Trust Bank are very aware of the value of education. Two of Virginia\u2019s children are in high school and the rest study in elementary and junior high school. Many of the ladies in the Trust Bank have had little or no education and for this reason, they look forward to the educational section of their monthly meetings with a Friendship Bridge facilitator. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of small loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\r\n\r\nAll of the women in the\u201cFlor del Lago Santa Catarina Group Trust Bank send their thanks to each Kiva investor for their kindness and generosity. We look forward to providing a follow up report on Virginia and the ladies in the Trust Bank in the near future!

She is married with 4 children aged between 7 and 17 years. They all go to school. She is a farmer and she has been growing maize for the past 7 years. While her husband is a business man. \r\n\r\nWith the loan from Kiva, she would like to pay workers who harvested maize. The profits from the business will be used to buy a goat. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

While her husband is a business man. \r\n\r\nWith the loan from Kiva, she would like to pay workers who harvested maize. The profits from the business will be used pay school fees for her children.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

The group is made up of eight hardworking women who, for the most part, make typical wrap-around skirts (cortes) in dark colors which are then contrasted by the bright colors - reds, whites, blues, purples, and maroons -  of their beautiful blouses (huipiles).  The eight women are extremely happy with the growth of their small businesses, due in part to the loans provided by KIVA investors. \r\n\r\nSixty-three-year-old Manuela is a member of  \u201cFlorecitas\u201d who never had an opportunity for a formal education.  She knows the value of having one.  In order to provide an education, food, and clothing for her eight children, she began a business of making typical wrap-around skirts (cortes) to sell in her community.  Her business now has four workers.  Manuela is requesting a loan so that she can buy a quantity of thread and yarn in lots of colors and textures. She wants to have plenty of inventory on hand  to meet the demand of her customers and increase her profits. \r\n\r\nManuela and her friends in the Trust Bank look forward to their monthly meetings when a Friendship Bridge Facilitator shares useful information with them on a variety of subjects. They learn about the world around them and within them as they hear about effective business practices, health and nutrition, as well as self-esteem and empowerment. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of small loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. It is most effective.\r\n \r\nThe eight women of \u201cFlorecitas\u201d send their infinite gratitude to the KIVA investors for supporting women\u2019s businesses in their world and helping them to change their communities.  Mil gracias (thank you)!!!

Not yet in school. She is a farmer and she has been in a business for the past 4 years. Also her husband is a farmer. With the loan from Kiva, she would like to buy more cows for rearing. The profits from the business will be used to increase her savings and to pay school fees of her children and to buy medical insurance.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He wants to improve his house because it\u2019s not in good condition, so he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable and protected. \r\n\r\nWith a little help from you, he can do really good and will make his dreams come true. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":118.26,"image":{"id":1922342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for the remodeling and to buy a new umbrella","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2015-07-08T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-07T00:50:04Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.25,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Libardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.97,"local_amount":143444,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":151189.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.41,"payment_id":711503016},{"amount":29.8,"local_amount":74651,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":78682.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.06,"payment_id":731020619},{"amount":29.24,"local_amount":77560,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":81748.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.78,"payment_id":752108777}],"funded_date":"2015-08-05T23:13:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":910804,"name":"Ephrance","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ephrance is a hard working woman.

She is a good mother, patient, a good listener, supportive, responsible and very hard-working.  She works at her business in the  'Chuquiaguillo\u2019 area, where those who are heading toward the towns of  the Yungas de La Paz must pass.   Until mid-20th century, this area was in private hands, used for agriculture and pasturage.\r\n\r\nMaria is brown-skinned, with brown eyes and long dark hair which she wears caught up behind her neck.  She is short, of medium complexion; her native language is  Aymar\u00e1,which she speaks at home.  She speaks Spanish as a matter of general knowledge and in the work she does.  Maria shares her life with her daughter, a school girl.  They live in a rented house made of bricks and cement, with a roof of corruged metal and wood floor, which has electricity, drinkable water and a sewer system.  \r\n\r\nMaria's work is selling lunches such as:  broaster chicken, roast beef, beef loin, beef or chicken Milanese and others. She carries out her business with the help of an friend who works as waitress.  \"I began my business selling food at the door of my houses; then I earned the necessary money to rent the place where I now work,\" she comments.  The advantage Maria's business has is that she counts on faithful customers and daily sales; the disadvantage is lack of capital to increase services and improve the menu.  Maria's dream is to improve her business; she wants to buy a rotisserie to be able to cook and sell chicken on skewers.  This is the first sequence of loans with the organization in the ten years she has been carrying out this activity.  \r\n\r\nThese are the reasons why Maria is asking for a loan: to buy a rotisserie to cook chicken on skewers and offer a new type of food in her food stall.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":328.3,"image":{"id":1914993,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" to buy a rotisserie cooker in order to sell chicken on skewers and offer a new food choice in her sales area","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-08T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-07T05:50:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-27T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-02T04:00:00Z","amount":470.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T04:00:00Z","amount":536.82},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T04:00:00Z","amount":580.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T04:00:00Z","amount":605.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T04:00:00Z","amount":614.95},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T04:00:00Z","amount":664.89},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T04:00:00Z","amount":666.55},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T04:00:00Z","amount":719.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T04:00:00Z","amount":749.15},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T04:00:00Z","amount":766.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T04:00:00Z","amount":811.41},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T04:00:00Z","amount":813.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.32},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.65},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.9},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.69},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.03},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.56},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.18},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":148.13,"local_amount":1008.56,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1022.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468983},{"amount":180.17,"local_amount":1226.72,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1243.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296815}],"funded_date":"2015-08-07T00:03:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Heatherly","image":1523379}},{"id":913168,"name":"Avelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Avelina, 59, is a married woman with four children, one of whom is in school.

Among their nine children, four are studying in college. It\u2019s hard to imagine how they survive and pay for the everyday necessities and educational expenses. But their secret is that they run three enterprises: hog raising, painting of vehicles such as jeepneys and tricycles, and a massage therapy service. Some of their children take turns in nurturing hogs while the others help their father to paint vehicles. The rest perform their household chores. The whole family functions together to ease the burden for each other. \r\n\r\nAs of now, they need additional capital for their businesses. Luisa plans to buy more piglets and feeds from a loan amounting to PHP 30,000. She\u2019s confident that her family can take care of more piglets because they know how to divide the tasks. In a few months, the return on investment will be higher and they can provide for their growing financial needs.  \r\n\r\nLuisa shares her experiences and aspirations with her co-fellowship* members at CCT Credit Cooperative in Tigbauan, Iloilo.

She also sells peanut and vegetables. Her husband, William, sells fish. They work hard to supply their family\u2019s daily needs and prepare for their children's education. They dream of renovating their house someday.\r\n\r\nAt present, it\u2019s the rainy season, which makes it difficult for fishermen and fish vendors; the price of fish is increasing.  Mary Grace wants to concentrate  on her direct selling business, peanut, and vegetable vending. She needs 10,000 PHP to buy more products and items to sell. Her income  will cover the loss from fish vending. She also plans to save money as additional capital to buy fish when there\u2019s a sudden drop of price.

He\u2019s married to Merelyn, 42, and they are blessed with two children. <br \/><br \/>For twenty years, Lauro has been selling fish in the town\u2019s public market. His wife is helping him all the time. It\u2019s their means to pay for daily household needs and the children\u2019s educational expenses. <br \/><br \/>But now the rainy season gives him difficulty to earn enough for the family. The price of fish increases during this season and he can hardly afford it. This is the reason why Lauro is appealing for additional capital worth 15,000 PHP to augment his business.
