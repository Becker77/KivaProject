She\u2019s not only concerned about herself, but wishes to succeed together with others. She owns a tricycle and her husband Dandy is a fisherman. They have two children studying in elementary. Her husband drives the tricycle when he\u2019s not out in the sea fishing. But most of the time, Joyce lets one of her neighbors drive her tricycle in exchange for a meager rental fee. In that way, she is giving the driver a source of income. However, there are times when her tricycle breaks down, just like today. \r\n\r\nShe has to buy some spare parts and pay for its repair. Thus she implores your generosity to lend her an amount of PhP 8,000 for this purpose. \r\n\r\nShe knows that continuous income from the tricycle can help sustain their daily expenses and prepare for her children\u2019s education. She envisions having more tricycle units for rent in the near future, and then she can employ more drivers in the community.

However, the income derived from her store varies from time to time, as it is usually affected by the competition within the area. \r\n\r\nAside from this, she has some neighbors who have the habit of paying later for those items they get. Sometimes it takes few days or weeks before they pay. The stability of her business is shaken by this practice because it depletes her capital. She is a considerate person who cannot refuse her neighbors, but she also has to earn enough money for their everyday needs and save some amount for their retirement. Self-employed citizens in the Philippines, especially in some remote areas, have no pension or medical benefits when they retire. They have to rely on their own savings or help from other people. With this consideration, Letecia needs to improve her business. \r\n\r\nShe plans to buy more items, particularly soft drinks, beverages and grocery items. She is requesting additional capital of PhP 12,000 that will surely boost her income and savings. She\u2019s praying that you have the kind heart to extend support to her.

She\u2019s married to Antonio and they have two children. At her old age, Yolanda can still manage a small canteen or food stall which is commonly known in the Philippines as \u201ccarinderia\u201d. She has been running this carinderia for almost twenty years and it has been very helpful in providing for her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nYolanda\u2019s business is considered valuable because many Filipino families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal.  If there is only one or two family members present for dinner, they would prefer to buy cooked viand or food. This is a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Yolanda\u2019s regular customers are her neighbors and the local community, students and working people. \r\n\r\nThe canteen business is quite exhausting especially for Yolanda who is already at her retirement age. She has to wake up very early and sleep late at night, but she persists because she has to prepare for her retirement. Self-employed Filipinos don\u2019t usually receive pension or medical benefits when they retire. This is the reason why Yolanda needs to improve her business, increase her income and save some amount for her retirement. She is requesting a loan worth 20,000 PHP that she will use to buy more ingredients like meat, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. Your generosity may ease her burden.

The entrepreneur\u2019s skills in finding network manufacturers and suppliers who offer low prices for their products is one major key in the success of this business, as well as the capacity to expand their market. \r\n\r\nAmador is into buying and selling products such as mat bags and umbrellas. He sells along the street and in front of a church, to entice church goers and passersby. He braves the rain and heat of the sun so he can supply the daily needs and education expenses of his children. He is a widower with three children. Sometimes his income is not enough, thus he plans to buy more bags and umbrellas. He knows that these items will be in demand this rainy season. He needs additional capital of 10,000 PHP to procure these products. Your generosity will be a great blessing to him and his children.  \r\n\r\nAmador dreams of a better living condition someday, and he regularly meets with his co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of his life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

She works every day from 8:00am until 10:00pm, and sometimes later if her customers need her services.  She also sells beauty products and natural products at the same time that she does her other work.<br \/><br \/>She is going to use this loan to buy dyes, permanents, and cosmetics.  She has been in the community bank for four years, and she likes it for the flexibility of the loans and the interaction with the facilitator who acts as the leader of the group.

Her house is located in a neighborhood in the municipality of Soledad. She started her business with the idea that she should occupy her time and that the best way to do it was to do what she liked and generate money for her family from it. Being a single mother, as she was widowed young, she started a business selling footwear, clothing and perfume. She offered these through a company with catalog sales which she managed to become a consultant for. She does her business every two weeks from 9 am to 11 am and 3 pm to 5 pm by visiting her neighbors. The rewards of her commercial activity have allowed her to support her family and her satisfaction is evidence of her total passion for business.

Therefore, she is requesting a loan so that she can buy more fabric. She wants to make aprons that are an important part of the typical outfit that the Maya women wear on a daily basis. She also wants to be able to buy fabric for the traditional wrap-around skirts (cortes) that the Mayan women buy to wear with their traditional aprons and blouses.  \n\nDolores is deeply motivated to see her business grow through a loan from Kiva lenders because she is committed to seeing her daughter graduate this year as a primary school teacher!\n\nThe eight women of \u201cCotzij ya\u201d look forward to the non-formal education program of Friendship Bridge when they have training in subjects like women\u2019s rights, women\u2019s and children\u2019s health issues, self-esteem, business management, and leadership. These are a few of the many topics presented by a facilitator at each monthly meeting. Dolores and her fellow members recognize the value of these monthly meetings as many of them have had little or no education. \n\nAll the women in the Trust Bank are deeply grateful to the Kiva lenders for providing them with the opportunities to develop their lives, their businesses and their community.

He is married with 4 children aged between 15 and 28 years, they all go to school. He is a farmer and he has been farming for the past 2 years. With the loan from Kiva, he would like to pay the workers who cultivated his maize. The profits from the business will be used to buy food for home consumptions and pay school fees for his children.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Busara rears animals and grows crops as the main source of income for her family, having started in 1995. Thanks to Busara's hard work, today she has four cows, ten sheep, and two horses, and she also grows wheat and clover on a 3.0 hectare plot of her own land.

It was used to buy more raw ingredients and supplies for her food stall. The loan enhanced her earnings and provided for her family\u2019s daily expenses and her child\u2019s educational needs. Thank you so much! Persistent as she is, she plans to improve her business by cooking more from more recipes and adding some snack items in her food stall. She is imploring your kindness to extend her another loan, of PhP 30,000, to buy additional cooking wares, eating utensils, raw ingredients, and snack items for her food stall. This will help her meet the increasing demand for cooked viands and other foods in her area. Her increased productivity will surely give her higher profits, paving the way to complete her child\u2019s education soon. She was consistent in repaying her previous loan, and she is a person of integrity. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of their work every week. That is also where she can draw strength and inspiration from God.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The fellowship groups gather each week to study God, build social capital, and repay their microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1923112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for additional cooking wares, eating utensils, raw ingredients, and snack items for her food stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-08T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-07T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jean","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10138.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523571},{"amount":180,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":8110.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711433999},{"amount":225,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":10138.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954918},{"amount":45,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2027.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044772}],"funded_date":"2015-07-09T05:42:15Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tony Gooch","image":970369}},{"id":913359,"name":"Ilei","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ilei is 39 years old and married with one child.

her poultry business. She is a very hard-working, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Runyejes, a remote village in Chuka. Genelica is happily married and is blessed with six adorable children. She has been practising mixed farming for the last 33 years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, Genelica has been selling milk, eggs and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and to earn extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Chuka area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, Genelica finds poultry farming very enjoyable: she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \"the increased profits I enjoy\". \r\n\r\nGenelica's biggest challenge, however, is meeting the really high level of demand. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is therefore seeking a loan of 20,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. As a woman, she finds that accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she is relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, Genelica will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbours and to the local market: this will translate into increased profits and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, Genelica intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry sales to other markets: this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will earn will be used to fully repay the loan, to permanently change her living conditions and to secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":70.51,"image":{"id":1923366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-09T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-08T01:20:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Genelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.87,"local_amount":3099.59,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3471.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506900},{"amount":18.98,"local_amount":1687.19,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023756},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":1481.29,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1658.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111853}],"funded_date":"2015-07-09T07:02:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":913381,"name":"Marie Fe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marie Fe is 20 years old and a very hardworking entrepreneur. <br \/><br \/>Marie Fe has a pig-fattening business in the Philippines.

However, she needs a little help to continue operating her business. She needs a loan of PHP 15,000 so she can supply her store with more grocery items to sell. By buying these items, she will be able to cater to the demands of customers, while simultaneously receiving more benefit from the (hopefully) increase in profit. \r\n\r\nEdna hopes that you can help her because this is a very relevant source of income for the family, in addition to Edna's husband, Romeo's job as a construction worker. The wage from his job is not really enough on its own to support their family's needs. That's why Edna hopes very much that you will provide a helping hand by lending to her. \r\n\r\nSome day, Edna dreams that her business will expand and her children will complete their schooling.

One way to improve it is to acquire an additional capital of PHP 34,000 to procure grocery items at wholesale prices so she can gain more profit. It can boost her income and savings. The time will come when she will own a big grocery store and her husband can just work in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll be a great blessing in advance.

I also want to be a good example for the young people in my community and show them that we can achieve whatever we set out to, no matter the distance or financial insecurity. Also my greatest desire is to give my parents the care they deserve for the great effort that they have made for us. \r\n\r\nI think that Kiva and FUNDAPEC is the most appropriate means to help us to reach our goals.\" \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1916056,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to cover higher education costs.

They are natives of a community in Veracruz whose founders named it \"The Bride of the Sun\" because of its very hot climate.  Now it is an industrial area that also has a lot of agriculture and livestock production.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for the name of this group comes from the nickname of the Mexican artist Mario Moreno, because for these members, he is an example of success and humility.  The members of this group are: Maria G., who sells cleaning products; Margarita, who sells fruit, Agustina and Ernestina, who sell food; Yomira, who sells items made of silver; Rosa Maria M., who sells tamales and traditional sweets; Delia, who sells cosmetics; Francisca, who sells shoes and food; Rosa, who sells groceries; and Maria Eugenia A.and Maria Eugenia Q. who have a nutritional center.\r\n\r\nAt the start, Maria Eugenia Q. sold only ladies handbags. She started this business 5 years ago with the goal of supporting the household expenses.  Later she was able to  move forward with her goals. \"Thanks to the earnings and opportunities from my loans, I was able to start up a  new business,\" she comments.  She opened a nutritional club where she offers a variety of foods and supplements to maintain a healthy diet.  In this business there is competition, but Maria is confident because she has demonstrated that she has the best products for sale and provides the best service in the area.  With the help of this new loan, she will be able to invest in handbags and a variety of flavors of powders to make shakes.      \r\n\r\nOne goal that she wants to achieve as soon as possible is to open a new nutritional center  to increase her sales.  The only thing she wants is for her 3 children to continue with their professional studies.                \r\n\r\nNote: This photograph was taken in Rosa's house.

Adri lo sabe y por ello, para prepararlos, desvena los chiles y los pone a hervir en una vaporera a la cual le agrega caf\u00e9 y az\u00facar para disminuir el  exceso de picante y darle un toque personal. Mientras tanto pica cebolla, jitomate, pasas y  pl\u00e1tano que se cocinar\u00e1n junto con la carne molida; una vez que la mezcla se encuentra en la estufa, ella se encarga de batir el huevo que servir\u00e1 para cubrir los chiles una vez preparados. El siguiente paso es rellenar con la carne cada chile, cubrirlos con harina, untarlos en el huevo y finalmente fre\u00edrlos en aceite muy caliente. Para acompa\u00f1ar el platillo guisa arroz rojo con verdura.\n   Do\u00f1a Adri dedica sus ma\u00f1anas a preparar la comida mientras que por las tardes recorre las calles de distintas colonias para ofrecer el rico pan que elabora su suegra.\n   Con las ganancias obtenidas ha remodelado su casa que pas\u00f3 de tener paredes de madera y techo de l\u00e1mina a tener un cimiento firme de loza; \u201ctrabajando arduamente, en equipo hemos logrado construir una nueva casa\u201d comenta contenta. Esta vez con el pr\u00e9stamo podr\u00e1 comprar queso y 15 pollos en pluma para iniciar una nueva actividad.\n\n*En la fotograf\u00eda, Adri muestra los chiles rellenos que prepara.\n","en":"Made up of very hardworking women, the Las Bellas group always have a lot of enthusiasm for their families. The group is from a small locality in  Veracruz known for its ample production of sugar cane and its intensive livestock activity.\r\n\r\nThe members of Las Bellas are: Dominga, who sells food; Adriana, cosmetics and food; Romarica, pi\u00f1atas and food; Aurora, Isela and Mar\u00eda, shoes, and Marina, clothes. Antonia runs a bread bakery; Yolanda, a hardware store; Rafaela, a pastry business and Zurisadai, a beauty salon. \r\n\r\nAdriana is a women who is dedicated to her family, which is made up of Jaime, her husband, and three children who are in school in the community. Adri, as a well known woman, has been selling tamales, chiles rellenos and bread for 10 years with the purpose of improving her family's quality of life.  \r\n\r\nChiles rellenos are a traditional food in the country and making them needs good technique and better seasoning.  Adri knows how to do it. She deveins chiles and boils them in a steamer to which she adds coffee and sugar to decrease the excess spiciness and give them a personal touch. Meanwhile, she dices onions, tomatoes, raisins and plantain, which will be cooked with the ground meat. Once the mixture is on the stove, she beats the eggs that will be used to cover the chiles once they are prepared. The next step is filling the chiles with the ground meat, covering them with flour, spread the egg mixture on them and finally fry them in very hot oil. To accompany the dish she cooks red rice with vegetables. \r\n\r\nAdri spends her mornings preparing the food and in the afternoons she goes to the streets of different neighborhoods to offer the delicious bread her mother in law makes. \r\n\r\nWith the profits she has earned she has remodeled her house  went from having wood walls and a metal sheeting roof to having a firm tile floor. \"Working hard as a team, we have been able to build a new house,\" she remarks happily. This time, she will buy cheese and 15 feathered chickens with the loan to start a new activity. \r\n\r\n*In th ephotogrpah, Adri is showing the chiles rellenos she makes. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3575,"image":{"id":1905669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cheese and 15 feathered chickens.

","en":"Firuza is the type of young woman you don't meet very often: she is only 18 years old and already an independent seamstress.  She sews women's clothes and is very skilled at her work.  She helps her parents to support the family and makes her own money, working from home.  Her father works as an electrician in an aluminum plant.  Her mother is a homemaker.  Firuza's sister also works as a seamstress.  The sewing machine that you can see in the photo is actually very old, older than Firuza herself.  For this reason, Firuza wants to buy a sewing machine of the \"Yamata\" brand, so that she can continue to grow her business.  Because she doesn't have enough money for this purchase, she is taking a loan.  This loan will help her to buy a new sewing machine and have a stable job."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":52.33,"image":{"id":1927866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Su sue\u00f1o es incrementar su producci\u00f3n, contratar tejedores y aumentar su variedad de productos, ella desea realizar la compra de m\u00e1quinas para tejer y coser ropa de cholita y mejorar su variedad de oferta. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 3 a\u00f1os que desarrolla esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Brigida solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de m\u00e1quinas para tejer y coser ropa de cholita para contratar tejedores y mejorar el negocio.\n","en":"Brigida is a young 29-year-old woman. She lives with her partner and has two children, 2 and 8 years old. Her business is producing textiles. She is a wonderful mother, sweet, sincere, sensitive, loving, kind, responsible and very hard working. She runs her business in her workshop located in the \u201cVilla F\u00e1tima\u201d area; characterized by informal fruit trade, trucks filled with fruit, vegetables and meat arrive from the north to be sold wholesale. The weather is cold and windy, the winds come from the mountain range at a height of 3600 meters above sea level.   \r\n\r\nBrigida has dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair in braids, small stature, and is slender. She dresses in traditional fashion (hat, shawl, skirt), her native language is Aymar\u00e1 which she speaks with her family. She speaks Spanish in general and in her business. \r\n\r\nHer life is shared with her partner who works in commerce and with her children; the older studies in school and the younger is not yet of school age. They live in their own home made of brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof and wooden floors. Their home has electric energy but no potable water nor sewage system.\r\n\r\nHer business is the manufacture and sale of wool apparel for women that pertain to a social and political indigenous movement known as cholita. She weaves alpaca wool shawls and makes skirts and petticoats for cholitas. Her children help with the knitting and sewing, \u201cI make all the typical wardrobe of the cholita, I sell the majority wholesale to retailers\u201d, she says. The advantage of her business is that the sales are wholesale, the disadvantage is the lack of money to invest in a weaving machine and an adequate sewing machine to increase her production capacity. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to increase her production, hire weavers, and increase her range of products. She wants to buy machines for weaving and sewing cholita clothing and improve the variety that she offers. This is the first in a sequence of loans with the institution, in three years, that will develop this activity. For these reasons, Brigida requests a loan to buy weaving and sewing machines to sew cholita clothing, to hire weavers, and to improve the business. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":216.94,"image":{"id":1910106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy weaving and sewing machines to sew cholita clothing, to hire weavers, and to improve the business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-09T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-08T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brigida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-22T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":25.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":61.82},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":64.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":65.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":72.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T04:00:00Z","amount":74.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T04:00:00Z","amount":73.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":79.8},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":84.2},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T04:00:00Z","amount":83.87},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T04:00:00Z","amount":90.53},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":92.06},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T04:00:00Z","amount":95.77},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":100.32},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T04:00:00Z","amount":102.54},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T04:00:00Z","amount":109.1},{"due_date":"2016-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":112.2},{"due_date":"2016-12-12T04:00:00Z","amount":111.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.82},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.86},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.02},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.8},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.2},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.87},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.53},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.06},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.77},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.32},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.54},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.1},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.2},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.67,"local_amount":25.67,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":25.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554887},{"amount":61.86,"local_amount":61.86,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":61.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468971},{"amount":64.26,"local_amount":64.26,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":64.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296803},{"amount":65.15,"local_amount":65.15,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":65.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076958}],"funded_date":"2015-07-10T17:46:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Pezdek","image":null}},{"id":913568,"name":"Nena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nena is 55 years old and married with three children.  \r\n\r\nNena is in the agricultural business, farming vegetables in the Philippines.

They aren't hugely profitable, she says, but they generate enough income to put a roof over the family's heads and send the children to school.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is applying for a loan, part of which she will use to buy more fruit and the rest to to buy seeds for planting yucca on a small plot of land that her father-in-law has loaned to her and her husband for growing yucca.

Since her husband works as a house painter she found it easy to run the business and most of her customers trust dealing with her.\r\n\r\nSince her business is still new, Sabah is acquiring a loan from Kiva's field partner Al Majmoua to increase her business merchandise with special construction accessories and hardware highly requested by her customers.  She hopes to stay capable of expanding her business and increasing her merchandise, so that one day she can move her two children from the public school to a private one. \r\n "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1923847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"buy construction supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Tyre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2015-07-09T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-08T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711390438},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730913979},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:27:06Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752004957}],"funded_date":"2015-07-14T13:56:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":913606,"name":"Areej","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Areej is a 30-year-old married woman from a village near the city of Hebron.
