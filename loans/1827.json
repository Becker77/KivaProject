Currently, her husband works as a day laborer, and her son studies at a public school. She lives in Merced de Cobuendo, which belongs to the parish of Chaltura. In this place, the people work raising animals. Tourists visit Chaltura because roasted guinea pig is sold there, as it is a typical dish of the area.\r\n\r\nLike her neighbors, Ines also makes a living raising animals. She has been performing this work for the past 7 years. She learned this business from her grandmother. She buys small pigs, raises them, and then sells them. The buyers go to her home to make their purchases, so she does not spend on transportation to take her pigs to the fair. Moreover, since she also cuts her neighbors' hair at her home, she earns additional income. After school, she studied beauty for three years, so she knows this business as well.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy more pigs and to improve the pigpens. She hopes to have greater security so that she is never the victim of a robbery. In addition, with this loan, she hopes to increase her income and to give her children a better quality of life.

She is ages 27 years old and a mother of two children who are both too young to get in school.  She is a cassava farmer and also works as a paid worker for four years, earning about 43,800 KHR per day. Due to her crop not growing well and the depreciation of cassava\u2019s price in the market, this causes her to lack the fund to start doing farming again for this season, so she decides to take a new Kiva loan via VisionFund.  \r\n\r\nFor Lai Heang, this is the fourth Kiva loan and the previous loan helped her family to have a better living condition. With this loan, she will spend it on buying one more hectare of farmland to expand her farming area. She hopes to gain more yields than last years.

Her husband works at a bank.\r\n\r\nKathia is a woman who likes to work in order to feel independent and with her earnings, she contributes to the household expenses. She works in retail, selling silver and gold-plated jewelry, among other things.\r\n\r\nShe does door-to-door sales, but the majority of the sales she makes are from her home. Each time she needs merchandise she travels to Cuenca, a city where she gets very high quality jewelry for a good price. She leaves her products on credit and then charges every eight to fifteen days. She has been in this business for six years, which has allowed her to make her own money for the sake of her family.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy silver and gold-plated jewelry, as she has many orders. She has been in the communal bank for more than nine years and she likes it because the loans are fast. Her dream is to give her children the best.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1915239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy silver and gold-plated jewelry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2015-07-09T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-08T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kathia Cesilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1077.91,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":107.79},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":107.79},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":107.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":107.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":107.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":107.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":107.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":107.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":107.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":330,"local_amount":323.37,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:55:13Z","rounded_local_amount":330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696559203},{"amount":330,"local_amount":323.37,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711474062},{"amount":220,"local_amount":215.58,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730993002},{"amount":220,"local_amount":215.59,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752081158}],"funded_date":"2015-07-09T18:56:32Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:20:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Ronald","image":1493932}},{"id":910845,"name":"Benkadi Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Dramane Fassoun est celui qui est au milieu tenant dans sa main la corde attach\u00e9 aux deux ch\u00e8vres.

Agus owns a stall that sells mobile airtime credits and mobile phone accessories and provides bill payment services (for utilities like electricity and water) to his community. Even though Lebak is still on Java Island and really near Jakarta, its infrastructure is not as good as that in Jakarta. That's why Agus' community members really need him so they can have access to communication and financial services. \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, Agus needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits and provide more bill payment services to his community. Agus\u2019 goal with Ruma in the near future is to serve as an e-commerce business for his community, through Ruma\u2019s latest product called Mapan, so later, his community can have access to better products with lower prices. \r\n\r\nAgus is the one who is seen in the photo.

There are a lot of people and cars in its streets. Shuhrat works as a taxi driver. He has been in this business for four years. He rents \u201cSprinter\u201d cars. Renting cars is not very profitable but he has to do it in order to put bread on the table. He would very much like to buy his own car because driving one's own car is more profitable.

Other noteworthy products are corn, beans, mango and lemons, as agriculture is important to the local economy.  \r\n\r\nIn one of these communities a group was formed:  Las Risue\u00f1as,(the smiling ladies).  The name refers to the characteristic that all members share.  They are:  Gloria and Enriqueta who sell food, Luz, Paula, Alejandra, Erika and Anai who sell clothing, Isabel who sells chickens, Francisco the bricklayer and Andres who manages a mechanics shop.  \r\n\r\nDona Enriqueta is better known as Queta.  She is married to Victor Manuel and has two children, ages 18 and 10.  While her husband and son work with livestock, she has sold food for more than 20 years.  Since she started she has not stopped selling her famous chiles rellenos and her delicious tamales.  They are the most popular items with her customers.  \r\n\r\nShe also began a door to door service on bicycle.  Thanks to her earnings she was able to purchase a motorcycle which saves time on deliveries.  She was also able to buy a stove, refrigerator, dishes for her small kitchen and cover the expenses of her daughters education.  \r\n\r\nShe comments, \"Two years ago I received my first loan and I decided to construct a store location to stabilize my business.  Thanks to the loans that I received, I was able to do this.\"  \r\n\r\nFor Dona Queta the customer is the most important.  She fills the orders that her customers place.  Her main goal is to increase her space.  She knows that the only way to do that is to first increase the number of customers that she serves.  She will invest the loan in the purchase of baking dishes, pans, pots, oil, a sack of beans and two sacks of sugar.  Those are the main ingredients that she needs to satisfy the palates she serves.  \r\n\r\nThe entire group is thankful for the opportunities that the loan offers, as the loans make their businesses stronger.  \r\n*The photograph was taken in Queta's patio, behind you can see the place that is under construction.  She is wearing a pink blouse with black.

Guille sells fresh meat but she also makes sausages and lard to better serve her customers. One of her most common challenges is the price fluctuation in the feed for her pigs which is why she always tries to have enough resources in her breeding center. The approximate amount of time for a pig to reach optimum development is six months, when it reaches a weight of 90 kilograms (about 200 lbs.). \r\n\r\nWith her earnings, Guille continues to optimize her business. In addition to contributing to the household expenses, another one of her achievements has been to remodel the appliances for her family which is made up of her husband Jorge and her six children. She needs this latest loan to buy a female specimen since she hopes to sell the offspring when they are small. \r\n\r\n\"Thanks to loans from VisionFund Mexico, I have been able to start my own business and I know that just like myself, more clients have strengthened their businesses\", says Guille enthusiastically. * The whole group is pictured in the photo, Guille is wearing a beige blouse and pink skirt.

He also works as a laborer, breeds small animals (chickens, guinea pigs, pigs and others), and grows food crops (cassava, banana, chia seeds, beans and others). \r\n\r\nThe loan granted will be used to buy manure and fertilizer for the proper maintenance of his coffee crop as well as for the recruitment of labor for the harvesting season. With this, Raul hopes to offer a better quality coffee to his customers which will have a positive impact on his income level and will improve his quality of life and that of his family.

She has a partner, and she lives with him and their two children. She studied through sixth grade and his partner works in agriculture. Marlis has worked selling seafood for many years. Her mother taught her to sell this product. She goes out to sell 3 times per week in her community and other nearby neighborhoods only in the morning. In addition she sells sweetened shaved ice (minutas)  for the past two years. It was her partner who motivated her to start this new business. She also works for a company at night,  and in her spare time she works with her partner planting basic grains. Marlis needs the loan to buy manure, corn seeds and insecticides.

He is unmarried, and lives with his mother and sister. He is only 24 years old, however in spite of his young age, he has achieved many successes. \r\n\r\nAbdurahmonkhuja is a very diligent young man. After graduating secondary school, his mother did not have enough money for his university education, thus Abdurahmonkhuja decided to provide for his family by whatever means. He opened his business and sold women's raincoats and coats. His aunt and mother help him with this business. \r\n\r\nAbdurahmonkhuja says that thanks to the blessing of his mother and the support of his beloved aunt, he has become a successful businessman. Now he intends to buy a new lot of women's coats and raincoats from a famous brand, and expand his business. He has his capital, however it is not sufficient. For this reason, Abdurahmonkhuja has applied for a loan, and is hoping that you will help

These are crab traps commonly known as \u201cpanggal\u201d in Iloilo, Philippines. These crab traps are connected to each other with a rope, usually one meter apart. Fishermen leave these traps submerged in the sea for several hours, then they come back to pull it with captured crabs inside. This is the kind of business that Jovie operates. She makes panggal for sale, while her husband, Jabell, catches crabs himself using panggal and a pump boat. Together they work hard to provide the needs of their family with three children. \r\n\r\nThis season is favorable for Jovie and her husband, because crabs are very abundant during the months of July to October. Although crabs can be caught all year round, they are more abundant these days. Jovie wants to seize the opportunity to earn higher income, and she plans to make more panggal to sell. She also desires to repair their pump boat so her husband can efficiently use it to catch crabs. She needs PhP 20,000 to buy more nets and ropes to make panggal and pay for the repair of their pump boat. This additional capital will bring her more earnings which she can utilize for her family\u2019s everyday needs. She can also save some money for her children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s Jovie\u2019s desire to see her children finish their studies and have a brighter future. She meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":337.5,"image":{"id":1925107,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more nets and ropes to make crab traps for sale and to pay for pump boat repair","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Barotac Viejo, Iloilo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-10T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-09T14:00:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jovie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":833.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":4999.98,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5077.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523590},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":2499.99,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2538.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434018},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3385.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954937},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":4166.65,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4231.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044788}],"funded_date":"2015-07-10T18:35:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":913977,"name":"Jean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jean is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a general store business in the Philippines.

Managing a business that long, she has experienced different circumstances that really tested her faith. There were times when her capital was almost drained due to huge collectibles. Some of her neighbors pay weeks or months later for the goods they get from her store. But Agnes remained strong, because this is her way of assisting her carpenter husband, Job, in providing for their children\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nA sari-sari store is comparable to a convenience store, but it\u2019s smaller and has limited products commonly used by an individual everyday. Examples of these products are sachets of toiletries, snack items, canned goods, instants, candies, beverages, and other commodities. It\u2019s quite advantageous for the people in the community to have an accessible variety store to buy one candy, an egg, and so on. This is the reason why sari-sari stores proliferate in communities of the Philippines. This is also the reason why competition becomes stiffer and stiffer. Customers prefer to buy from stores with wide selections and supplies. Agnes is has problems with this because, as you can see in the picture, she has very limited stocks. \r\n\r\nShe appeals for your help through a loan worth 10,000 PHP, which she can use to buy more supplies to enhance her store. She aspires to improve her sales to be able to earn more. She dreams that in the near future her business will grow and progress. She\u2019s praying for a better life, not just for herself, but also for her whole family. She wants her children to finish college and obtain good and stable jobs. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group comprises 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1925117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more supplies to enhance her variety store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Barotac Viejo, Iloilo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-10T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-09T14:10:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4062.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523591},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2708.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434019},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.3,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3385.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954938}],"funded_date":"2015-07-10T15:29:58Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JenniferN"}},{"id":914012,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of three children, Emma works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a fishing business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from food vending.

She\u2019s also a survivor of Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013 together with her children. \r\n\r\nSusan runs a sari-sari (variety) store in Barotac Viejo, Iloilo, and she continues to work hard in order to maintain and improve it. Aside from her variety store business, she also sells fish in a nearby market. However, the income derived from her two businesses goes up and down. It is usually affected by the weather and competition within the area. When it\u2019s raining and fish are expensive, she focuses on manning her store. But the stability of her store is also shaken by long-term debts by some of her neighbors. She has to make it more secure with additional capital amounting to PHP 19,000 that she can use to buy more grocery items to sell. With an enhanced inventory, she can still earn enough despite many debtors. The additional capital will also increase her buying power when fish are scarce and expensive. She\u2019s praying that you have a kind heart to extend support to her. It will surely go a long way. \r\n\r\nSusan dreams of a bigger store and better living conditions someday.

The members and their businesses are: Judith who makes a living selling food and chickens; Valentina, Cirila and Alicia, who sell food; Norma, Elida and Irma who sell chicken; Mar\u00eda, Carmela and Elena who sell cosmetics.

These days he grows sugar cane, mango and corn, making the most of all the characteristics of the land. He works all through the year since the sugar cane is harvested every six months, the mango once a year and the corn crops constantly since he plants two different varieties. Similarly he gives employment to twenty extra people during the harvest. With the profits he has made he has helped his wife Reyna to open a business selling vegetables. \"Working in the countryside is nice and even more so if you have the family's support. For the time being we are just selling vegetables from the house but we haven't ruled out the idea of setting up a grocery business\" he said very enthusiastically.\r\n\r\nThis time he is asking for the loan to buy corn seed and fertilizers for the next harvest. The whole group thanks each one of the people who make the opportunity of a loan possible.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken in Mago's house. He is crouching and behind him you can see the members of the group and the table where he arranges the

Merle wants to borrow 50,000 PHP to repair and improve the fence of her pig cage. As you can see in the photo, the fence is fastened only by a few wires so it has the tendency to fall any time. After several weeks, those medium-sized hogs will grow bigger, and they will jump across the fence. Therefore this financial assistance is urgent, and Merle will be very grateful for it. She plans to buy hollow blocks and cement to make a higher concrete fence. She will also buy feed, medicine, and vitamins to counter the common illnesses of pigs that bring losses to hog raisers during the rainy season. In due time, she aspires to have a big piggery that will provide enough profit for her family. This will ensure their daily sustenance and the children\u2019s education. She dreams that all her children will finish their studies and become successful in their careers and lives.

She lives in Salima, a district in the central region of Malawi. Deliah was born in a low income family and had to work extra hard to support herself through school. Her determination shows when she explains that her parents could not support her through school and she had to go back at a later stage when she was able to support herself. Today, Deliah is requesting a loan so that she can start running her own business. This will help her give her children a better life. She is determined to see all four of them through university.\r\n\r\nDeliah is excited to start running her own business. She will set up her business in Salima and provide mobile money transfers to her community. This means that people will go to her to send and receive money as well as pay their bills. Zoona has done market research in Salima and established that the location where Deliah is going to set up is ideal for mobile money transfers, as a lot of people do not have bank accounts and use unsafe methods of moving their monies such as through bus services.

His parents ran their own small business and so did some of his aunties and uncles. Malawi, with few large-scale retailers, is mainly dependent on small traders to move and supply goods. Growing up, Charles always wanted to run his own business and become successful so that he could help support his siblings. He explains that his parents struggle to pay for their school fees, as they do not earn a lot from their small business. Charles has three sisters and two brothers.\r\n\r\nCharles faces a challenge accessing capital for him to start running his own business. He has a high school education and when he tried to access a loan through the bank, he was sent back as he does not have any collateral. Malawi's financial sector is basic and highly limited.\r\n\r\nCharles is requesting a Kiva loan so that he can start running his own mobile money transfer business as an agent for Zoona, in Malawi. This means that Charles will set up a small trolley outside one of the popular agriculture shops in Kasungu, and offer mobile money and bill payment services to people in his community. He will earn an income for providing the service. This loan will be used for Charles to purchase a small trolley, a basic phone, which he will use to make transactions, and provide the funds needed for him to serve his community. Charles is happy to start his business. He hopes to be a good example and show the community that hard work pays off and give his fellow youths the same opportunity, once his business grows. He explains that employment in Malawi is very hard to find and by setting up his mobile money outlet, he can contribute positively to job creation.\r\n\r\nCharles thanks the Kiva lenders for this life changing opportunity to start his own business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1916816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology"],"use":"to purchase a small trolley, a basic phone and provide the cash needed to serve people in Kasungu, Malawi who need to access financial services","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MW","country":"Malawi","town":"Kasungu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.5 34","type":"point"}},"partner_id":444,"posted_date":"2015-07-10T19:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-09T19:50:06Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MWK","disbursal_amount":516500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":24,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":312024}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":724.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-07-24T10:53:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":914104,"name":"Vy's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A 54-year-old, mother of three children, Vy is a rural villager living in Siem Reap province.
