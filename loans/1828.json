He lives in an IDP [internally displaced persons] settlement with his wife and two sons. His wife is a housekeeper and educates children. Huseyn has been earning money for the family working as a butcher for 16 years. People go to him when they need to cut cow or sheep meat properly. He earns 200 Azerbaijani manats (AZN) monthly from this. \r\n\r\nButchery is one of the oldest and most prevalent professions. Azerbaijan cuisine is very famous and various. There are a lot of different delicious dishes from meat. Some of the recipes require meat to be specially cut. For these cases, most people refer to butchers.

She prefers a loan from GHAPE because of its low interest rates, convenient repayment time, training obtained before disbursement, and the follow-up for proper utilization.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":28.58,"image":{"id":1925673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy bags of beans, Irish potatoes, garri, carrots, firewood and soap","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Nitop two Bamenda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":40,"posted_date":"2015-07-10T22:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-09T22:10:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fransica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2016-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2016-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2016-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2016-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2017-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2017-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":16670},{"due_date":"2017-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":16600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.57},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.57},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.57},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.57},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.57},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.58,"local_amount":16670,"processed_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":16987.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752093128}],"funded_date":"2015-07-11T21:22:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":914133,"name":"Noor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noor is 32 years old and lives in a sector in Jordan called Hashmeyeh; she is a very helpful woman.\r\n\r\nAfter she felt that her husband was facing financial problems, Noor decided to help him and start her own business in her home to help him with the household expenses to live a good life with her small family.\r\n\r\nShe started to sell clothes with a low quantity of products, and she started to feel that she is a productive woman and she can do something for her community, therefore she is thinking to expand and develop her work.

Rega's goal towards Ruma in the near future is to serve an e-commerce business for his community, a Ruma\u2019s latest product called Mapan, so later, his community can have access to better products with lower prices.

Zoona has done market research in Malomo and has determined that the location for this kiosk is ideal. Elton will be one of the main operators of Zoona mobile money transfers in town and a large number of families will be using his service. This opportunity to run his own business means a lot to Elton. He will have some income to cater to his basic needs. He is hopeful that he will become financially stable through this business and hopes to be able to send money back home to his mother."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1916950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology"],"use":"to start a mobile money transfer business in his community in Malomo, Malawi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MW","country":"Malawi","town":"malomo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.5 34","type":"point"}},"partner_id":444,"posted_date":"2015-07-10T23:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-09T23:40:08Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elton","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MWK","disbursal_amount":516500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":24,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312024}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":724.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-07-21T20:10:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":912152,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence is 35 years old and lives in the town of Abaita Ababiri in the Kampala west region of Uganda.

The inhabitants get water from wells or from the river.  Actually the water is not fit for consumption. \"Our need is for water in the kitchen as the river water is contaminated\" he says. The advantage of his house is that it is close to recent water connections and his disadvantage is the lack of money to connect to the running water. <br \/><br \/>His dream is to finish the construction of his house. He wants to undertake the water connection  for his kitchen, bathroom and laundry to stop using well water and provide his family with healthy water to live. This is his first loan with the institution in the five years that he has been building his house.

Sari-sari means \"variety\". Since then, they provide the people with products mostly needed for everyday survival - from products for personal hygiene such as shampoo, toothpaste, and powder to condiments, food, canned goods and other stuffs at a low cost. This is why many of those who want to go into business often start by being a sari-sari vendor because with just a small capital, you can automatically operate a store and earn. <br \/><br \/>It's just like Salve, 55 years old, from Pasay City, Metro Manila. She began being involved in this kind of business five years ago. And through all those years, she was able to provide her children a living through the income she gets from the store. What she does is basically buy stuffs in a large quantity and then display them at her store and sell them at retail, often at a price that is very affordable for people but is larger than the original price so she can have a profit. <br \/><br \/>However, you cannot expect a regular and stable income from this since sales vary from time to time. For this reason, Salve wants to ask you for a PHP 15,000 loan that she will use to buy more supplies of products to display in her store. Certainly, this will really help her improve her business and attract more customers. <br \/><br \/>She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is 33 years old. She has a small family: her husband and only one child. \r\n\r\nShe and her husband are engaged with the occupation of tailoring and a spice item business at her own home village. Santilata is a very good tailor with a specialization in stitching blouses. \r\n\r\nNo doubt she has everything as per the required basic necessities of life: a two wheeler, a good shop and other allied items to manage her family. Still, her family members are not happy. Why? Due to no availability of an owned house.\r\n\r\nAt present they are staying at a rented house. The current house is made from lower standard brick and roofed with asbestos, which creates a very critical situation during the rainy season. The most important thing is the apprehensive house is completely not secure and safe.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, she decided to construct a house for better living standards. For house construction, the fund requirement is more, and that is the main concern of Santilata. She decided to borrow a loan from any bank or other financial institution.

This is Nunung, one of Ruma\u2019s agents. Nunung lives in Cianjur, located in West Java, around 2 hours and 30 minutes from Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. She lives there with her husband and her three children.<br \/><br \/>By supporting this loan, you will be providing extra working capital for Nunung's shop. This will allow Nunung to become an agent for Ruma\u2019s layaway product called \"Mapan,\" designed for lower-income communities. Mapan enables customers to save up, little by little, by depositing change at agents like Nunung, and as their balance grows, it allows customers to make major asset purchases like housewares, appliances, and school supplies for their children. <br \/><br \/>As a Mapan agent, Nunung is responsible for processing deposits from customers into their Mapan accounts, as well as receiving orders from customers who want to buy products listed in Ruma's Mapan catalog.
