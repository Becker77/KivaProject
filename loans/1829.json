She is standing at the first row as third person from the left side with raised hand in the photo.

Her husband is helping her to promote the business. Through this business, she earns a monthly income of 9,000 INR. Her opinion is that from this small income it is very difficult to maintain her family, and to get sufficient surplus to reinvest in the business is practically impossible. In the current market situation, the competition is also very high. \r\n\r\nAnother big investment is necessary for the expansion of business, but fund scarcity is the main concern. So she formed a group for strengthening social relations and to avail a loan for the expansion of her business.\r\n\r\nShe plans to purchase a huge quantity of modern and popular footwear from the wholesaler. She hopes to get more and more profit from her business expansion and save money for re-construction of her house. She also wishes to send her children to a better school for education.\r\n\r\nThe other 10 members of the group are also smart and actively engaged with different professions like cloth store, cycle store, medical store, tailoring, photo studio, fertilizer, hotel, book store and painting. With this loan, they all hope to boost up their livelihoods. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1927000,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a huge quantity of modern and popular footwear.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"M.Rampur, Kalahandi , Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2015-07-12T13:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-11T13:10:05Z","loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Babita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hemanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jashobanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kaibati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kanchani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Premasila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sapna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":220000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":220000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":914703,"name":"Sokna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokna, 42, is local farmer living in Kampong Cham province.

This is her story:\r\n\r\nLily and Sandra are a mother and daughter team from Peru. It all began as a game, when Sandra's little boy was sent to fine psycho-motor therapy. They both became immersed in the manual training and realized that if they let their imagination run wild they could create original works of art. Lily recalls that when she was a child she developed an unexplainable fascination for all kinds of stones. One day, when she was playing with other kids in her parents' ranch in the Nazca valley she cut herself with an arrow. She kept the piece in her hand and treasured it for life, not knowing the stone's true name \u2013 obsidian. Now, many of her designs mainly feature obsidian. Lily loves to transform gemstones by giving them life through her designs. \r\n\r\n\"I am a deeply religious person and I am certain that God planned for me and other artisans around the world to find this microcredit opportunity.

She wants to sustain her family needs and she envisions her business turning into a wholesaler business. The realization of this starts today if you let her borrow a loan worth PHP 37,000. She would use this to buy more grocery stuffs and mineral water to sell in her sari-sari store. <br \/><br \/>She hopes that you will not ignore this. It means a lot to her if you respond to her prayer. <br \/><br \/>She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1926508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more grocery stuffs and mineral water to sell in her sari-sari store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-12T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-11T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Argie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":37000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.62},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":12333.35,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:22Z","rounded_local_amount":12435.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523612},{"amount":165,"local_amount":7400.01,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":7461.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434040},{"amount":220,"local_amount":9866.68,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":9948.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954959},{"amount":165,"local_amount":7399.96,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":7461.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044808}],"funded_date":"2015-07-12T19:17:04Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":912497,"name":"Ramanatahiry","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ramanatahiry est une jeune femme dynamique de 30 ans.

His parents passed these virtues onto him as he was growing up, and involved him in all of their activities in the field.  \r\n\r\nToday, at 20 years old, he makes a living as a farmer thanks to his upbringing.    He owns sugarcane crops and alternates this business with a job as a day-worker to complement his income, which he uses to sustain his family.\r\n\r\nHis drive and tenacity have brought him to achieve the goals that he puts his mind to and he always goes looking for alternatives that help him to get ahead.

She also sells maize in the canton, as it isn't a suitable place for sowing the crop. So she makes use of this activity to grow her business little by little. Her husband and their son help her in their spare time. <br \/><br \/>She is asking for a loan to stock her shop with more produce. She intends to buy bread, rice, sugar, salt and sweets, as people are asking for a lot of items that she doesn't currently stock. She could meet the demand with a better stocked shop. <br \/><br \/>Melva wants her children to complete their studies and become professionals.

Adriana sees that her spouse does not earn enough to help her family and chose to work to help with household expenses. She makes a living in business, selling shoes through catalogues and Avon products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and accessories for women). Her sales are made door-to-door. She goes out two or three times a week to offer her products and she allows credit. She collects every 8 or 15 days. With a good clientele she has done well in the 2 years since she opened this business and that has permitted her to get ahead. This loan will be used to buy clothes, shotes, and catalogue cosmetics. She has been in this credit group since its beginning and likes the help that they have given her with the loans. Her dream is that her family will want for nothing.

Her only challenge is collecting receivables from those who buy on credit, but she is thankful to God that her store earnings are enough for their daily sustenance and the earnings have helped send her kids to school.\r\n\r\nShe is a typical Filipino mother who finds other means to augment her income.

She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her. She values her store so much since it is where she gets the funds to support her children's school needs.\r\n\r\nMaria aims to sustain and grow her small store into a big grocery store. Her simple dream is to see all of her children go to college. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and it is there where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has been involved in this business for 28 years already, but now the cassavas hardly grow and she cannot get good outputs to resell.\r\n\r\nThis is the second time that Thit has applied for a loan with VisionFund, Kiva\u2019s partner.  As her group's leader, she will use her loan to buy cassava seeds to grow. She hopes to increase the productivity of her crops so that she can earn a good income to support her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1927569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cassava seeds to grow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Mondulkiri province,  Keo Seima district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2015-07-13T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-12T01:50:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thit","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Touch","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-07-28T02:08:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Salwen","image":812309}},{"id":915106,"name":"Alyar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alyar is 28 years old and married.
