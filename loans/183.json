He is 51 and is the father of 9 children whose ages range from 18 to 28.  Two of them go to school.  He studied through the 4th grade of the old school system and didn't continue because of his parents' lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family in the district of Boane.  He doesn't support anyone besides his immediate family.  He left Matola for Boane to start a pharmacy business and later decided to move his home to this location.  He has owned his own business for 20 years and has 4 employees.  He makes a monthly income of 4,000 to 5,000 meticais and uses it to support his family, pay his workers, and save some in a commercial bank (BIM or BCI).  He has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through a friend and decided to request his first loan.  This is his third credit and it is for 15,000 meticais.  He will use it to purchase construcion materials (100 bags of cement) to produce bricks for his home.  His previous loans were both for 8,500 meticais and both were used for the same activity.  In the future he hopes to request more loans to finish his home and to expand the services he offers at his business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Vitolina has many years of experience in this business.  Vitolina needs a loan of WST $1350 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Vitolina joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Vitolina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vitolina F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

","en":"The communal bank \"Santa Maria\" is represented by Darwin, and is maD. up of 15 members who are working with our foundation in their 2nd loan cycle, demonstrating, as always, responsibility and compliance in their payments.  A great majority of the members sell products, such as groceries, fruit, electric appliances, snacks, and some have businesses, such as a bakery.  For example, Darwin works in public passenger transportation from 6 in the morning until 11 at night so that he can make a daily income and support his 3 children and his wife.  His wife weaves blankets and sells them on order so that she can help her husband a little, who works very hard every day to improve the quality of life for his family.  As far as the competitive environment, one might say that it is very strong, since many of the members find it necessary to take their sales to outlying areas due to the strong competition in the market.  Those who sell from their homes must wait for their customers to come to get their businesses moving.  In the case of Maria Luisa, who sells food, she has her boarders and does not have much trouble making her daily income.  \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy supplies, merchandise, tools and materials.  For example, Darwin will buy spare parts for his vehicle, since his springs are failing and he needs money to change them.  Maria Luisa wants to make some changes to the furniture in her boarding-house, to proviD. better comfort for her customers, who are the ones that generate the income necessary to support her family.  The main expectation of the members is to make their businesses grow so that their families do not lack for anything and so that they can give their families greater comfort in their homes.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":480355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"working capital to buy supplies, merchandise, tools and materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3600,"lender_count":112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Darwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Editta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Editha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeslee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Solange","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":3600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4048.4},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4094.98},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4142.1},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4189.77},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4237.98},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4286.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":582.97},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":589.68},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":596.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":603.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":610.27},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":617.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1172.65,"local_amount":8143.38,"processed_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:26Z","rounded_local_amount":8173.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909433},{"amount":596.46,"local_amount":4142.1,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4157.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909434},{"amount":603.33,"local_amount":4189.77,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4205.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945008},{"amount":610.27,"local_amount":4237.98,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4253.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945009},{"amount":617.29,"local_amount":4286.77,"processed_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4302.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945010}],"funded_date":"2010-02-01T23:03:12Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":177175,"name":"Mao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Mao E. and his wife, Mrs. Sophoin Auk (pictured together), were married in 1988 and have four children: three sons and one daughter.

The reason for this name is because these flowers grow in one of the member's homes. The group is situated in the Julian Grajales locality, Copainala municipality in Chiapas state, Mexico. It's also known as 'San Antonio'. The group is made up of 3 ladies who have known each other for 40 years. \r\n\r\nSenora Fredy is Las Azucenas' representative. She is 40 years old, and studied until the third grade of secondary school. Fredy is married to Rofino Farelo Sanchez and in total they have 7 children, 5 of which are under their care: Magdiel (20), Esdra (17), Lia Anilu (14), David (21), who is in the third grade of secondary school, and Yeider (10) who is in the sixth grade of primary school. \r\n\r\nFredy has worked selling bread for 20 years. Before this she worked with her mother, Raquel V. G., whom she supported doing the same activity. Now only Fredy makes bread. She is seeking a loan to purchase ingredients such as flour, eggs, oil, yeast, royal, cinnamon, margarine and milk, to continue her activities and to support her husband with the household costs, so together they can move forward and allow their children to study so each one has a better future in life. \r\n\r\nFredy started this group with her mother, Raquel V. G., who works selling clothes such as pants, t-shirts, blouses and shirts, among others. The other member of the group is Rometilde Hernandez Hernandez who sells snacks such as gorditas, tostadas and empanadas, among others. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Abura town in the Central Region.  Gari is a Ghanaian staple painstakingly made from cassava and can be eaten in a variety of ways. Kenkey is another staple made from fermented cassava and corn dough. \r\n\r\nAbena is married and has six children.  Her sale of gari and kenkey supplements her husband\u2019s income as a farmer. She helps pay the cost of sending their children to school \u2013 mainly school uniforms and books, and also some of the utilities bills. \r\n\r\nIn order to save up for higher education fees for her children, Abena needs to increase her earnings.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

She lives with her parents, whom she helps with household expenses. Although she is very young, she already knows what it means to work hard. She sells clothing in downtown Puno: she rents a shop where she sells her original, beautiful dresses, which are in high demand among young women, in particular for wearing to school graduation dances. Luz has two years of experience in this business, during which time she has lessened her family's financial burden. The thing she likes most about her job is giving advice to the young women who come to buy dresses. She always tells them which dresses suit them most, or which ones go best with their skin tones. She is a good saleswoman and hopes to have a larger shop where she can sell not only dresses, but also casual clothing. The thing she likes least about her job is having to stay at the shop for long periods of time. This is Luz's second loan with [kiva.org partner] Microfinanzas Prisma and, even at her young age, she already understands she must repay the loan and not fall behind on her payments.

Thanks to an invitation to join the bank extended by some of her neighbors, she obtained her first loan which she used to buy ingredients for the tamales: corn, banana leaves, chicken, etc.\r\n\r\nHer current loan will be used to buy an industrial stove and, of course, more ingredients for tamale preparation.\r\n\r\nThe goal she has in mind now and has had for a long time now and that she continues to strive for is to have an electric juicer and to open a juice bar in an area with lots of foot traffic.\r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to continue to support her youngest son\u2019s secondary and university education.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":525937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy an industrial stove and ingredients to make tamales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-05-02T01:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Petronila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther Consuelo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":1900,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1912.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694161},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":956.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877126},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":956.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617098}],"funded_date":"2010-05-21T18:42:06Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":198036,"name":"Buhumuriro Abarihamwe Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A determined and very ambitious R.

She has 3 children: Javier is 22 years old and has graduated high school; Joselin is 21 years old, she is single and she is studying Sociology and English in university; and Ivan is 10 years old and he is in primary school. Eva requested a loan to invest in her cosmetics business and to purchase articles for the home. She travels door to door selling her products but clients also come to her home when they need to purchase a gift. Her clients are her neighbors, her acquaintances, and her family. She sells products such as cosmetics, perfumes, lipsticks, deodorants, skin creams, nail polish, Rimel brand products and household articles such as dinnerware, batteries, spoons and bedding.  She started her business 20 years ago when she was still single. Her mother was also in this business and she showed her and grew interested. She went to school during the week and on Saturdays and Sunday she would go out to sell her products to her clients. She set up her business with her own savings. She started to buy merchandise and today she is able to expand her business even more with the help of these loans. She is very happy to receive this loan because she will be able to add variety to her inventory. Her business is important because she is able to earn money and it is a distraction for her. She laughs, she cries, but the best part about the work is being in contact with other. She gets great satisfaction for have money. Her business is popular and clients recommend others to come. The challenge she faces is having to deal with fluctuating prices.  Sometimes prices go up. She reinvests her earnings in something she enjoys. She is planning to expand the variety in what she sells. She wants to start selling shoes and to reach her goal she will sell more with even greater fervor. This business has helped her financially and she has been able to send her children to school and bring about some renovations to their home.  Her dream is to see her business expand even more. She also dreams of seeing her youngest son continue going to school to have a career.  In whichever way possible her two eldest kids are almost ready to be independent. \r\n\r\nJantetelco is a beautiful place, cool and tranquil with a great deal of vegetation. They make candies from yams, milk, and berries. The members of this group wish to covey a note of thanks to Kiva and Fundacion Realidad for the support provided to them for the development of their business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":624583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase merchandise for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"JANTETELCO MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-10-29T19:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Misael ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlota","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Buenaventura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minerva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.82},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.82},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.82},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.82},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":869.94,"local_amount":10590.54,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":10741.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554990},{"amount":539.95,"local_amount":6573.3,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6667.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691480},{"amount":315.11,"local_amount":3836.16,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3890.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430664}],"funded_date":"2010-10-31T11:24:45Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":247208,"name":"Karina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Karina, de 32 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy sincera y trabajadora, vive en su casa propia junto a sus 2 queridas hijas Neyla de 8 y Sof\u00eda de 4 a\u00f1os, quienes son el principal motivo de todos sus esfuerzos.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

to distribute contraceptives, provide health education, and go on home visits. Meeting monthly on the hospital grounds, they share their experiences and problems in the field and try to find solutions. They are being helped by the Runyenjes Hospital staff that has provided information about family planning issues and also supplied them with contraceptives. Other partners of the Runyenjes group include the Ministry of Health and numerous other organizations, such as the Chogoria Hospital CBD. In 2001, Kisumu Medical & Education Trust sponsored updates and trainings on a number of key issues, including family planning, the Community Based Abortion Care Project (COBAC), as well as first-aid and home-based care. KMET have been supplying the group with contraceptives as well as Nutriflour which they distribute to the community. The community truly appreciates the services KMET is offering through their partnerships. KMET has also empowered the group's members through its loans. Consequently, Runyenjes group's members have improved their living standards and health status as well as the severity of poverty in the community. The members are motivated and have been able to reach more clients with family planning services. The area where the group provides its services is agriculturally rich, and the main economic activity and source of income is farming. It is the case also for the members of Runyenjes group - 90% of them grow various crops ranging from tea and coffee, to maize and bananas. The produce, especially bananas grown in large amounts, is transported to Nairobi, 200 km away. A lot of money is spent on hiring a truck to transport the produce to the market for sale. The Runyenjes group is therefore asking for a loan of US$5,000 to help them pay for part of the distribution van cost so as to make product distribution easier and less

The dough is cooked first and then balled in a plantain leaf. It is boiled again for hours. Kenkey is served hot or cold with stew or ground pepper and fried fish. Agnes procures bags of maize from farmers in the surrounding communities. She supplies to retailers in her community and also sells on a table top in the local market square. She has been in business for over twenty years. Agnes wants a loan to procure bags of maize to produce the kenkey in bulk. She needs to increase her profit to be able to provide for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":263546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy maize in bulk, which she will use to make 'kenkey,' a local food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Offinsu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2009-02-02T02:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":63.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.46,"local_amount":127.28,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":127.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27132476},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":63.64,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:58:43Z","rounded_local_amount":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36028966},{"amount":190.92,"local_amount":254.56,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":255.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44615315},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":63.64,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53012621},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":63.64,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:17:31Z","rounded_local_amount":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53012622},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":63.64,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63234674},{"amount":47.7,"local_amount":63.6,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:03:12Z","rounded_local_amount":63.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63234675}],"funded_date":"2009-02-02T03:40:18Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:03:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"April Newman","image":122414}},{"id":90679,"name":"Luis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis tiene 25 a\u00f1os y vive en casa de sus padres.

She is 36 years old and lives in her own house, along with her 2 daughters, who are 9 and 2 years old. They are the reason for all her hard work. \r\n\r\nCatalina\u2019s business is fuel sales, which she does as a street vendor. She goes to work very early in the morning in search of customers, who have no doubts about buying from her due to the affordable prices she offers. She is a very persuasive salesperson and almost always returns home with her containers empty. What she likes most about her job is talking with her customers. She has been doing this for 10 years and the most difficult part is having to be in the street all day, putting up with sudden changes in the weather. Even so, she knows she has to work very hard to achieve her goals. She hopes eventually to have a store where she can sell her fuel in more comfortable conditions. \r\n\r\nCatalina is in her second loan from MFP. She is very determined to make her payments on time because she would like to receive future loans. In her communal bank she is a very participative and is supportive of everyone else. With her loan of 1500 PEN she plans to buy more fuel and increase the amount she sells daily.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

She lives with her 48 year-old husband Rub\u00e9n and her 3 grown-up children.  They work hard every day to get ahead in life.  Two years ago this entrepreneurial woman set up an Internet caf\u00e9 in her house.  She starts working at 9 o'clock in the morning and works until 10 o'clock at night.  She is very happy because her children help to mind the business when she has to go out.  Although the business is relaxed, she says that she has to make sacrifices because very often her customers ask her to stay open until late.  However, because she makes a good income, she tries to make these sacrifices and continues to work in order to help her husband with the constant household expenses.  Over time, she has attracted good customers who keep coming back.  She has also managed to set up her Internet stations better.  In the future, she is planning to expand her business and she also wants to set up a video game rental place.\r\n\r\nThis will be the tenth loan which Luz has had from MFP and she pledges to make her repayments in a timely manner because she does not want to give a bad impression to the people who, through funding her loan, will allow her to continue working in search of progress.  Luz plans to invest the loan in the purchase of 2 video games in order to begin her future business which she says she will improve her income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":627985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

Don Juan se siente muy agradecido con su cu\u00f1ado porque gracias a \u00e9l ahora tiene su propio negocio y tiene una entrada de dinero para sostener a su familia. Su desventaja es que la peque\u00f1a finca no esta tecnificada y eso le provoca costos adicionales y el peligro de las plagas es un verdadero dolor de cabeza. Pero su ventaja es que el caf\u00e9 es un producto bastante comercializable y una vez que sale la produccion la vende rapido. El prestamo que esta solicitando en esta ocasion lo necesita para comprar melaza, fertilizantes, y pagar la mano de obra por la chapia de la tierra. Su meta es llegar a tener 10 mz de tierra cultivada y con el apoyo de este prestamo poco a poco lo ir\u00e1 logrando. Este es el primer ciclo de don Juan en FAMA y espera cumplir con el compromiso de sus pagos al dia.     ","en":"Juan Miguel is 53 and a small scale coffee grower. He is married and has six children, from 5 to 17 years old. Together with his family he lives in El Guineo neighborhood in Patuca municipality. Juan Miguel began growing coffee thanks to one of his brothers-in- law who gave him a gift of a plot of land and provided him with a small loan. He has spent 20 years cultivating coffee, a task he learned how to do from his father who is himself a small coffee grower. \r\n\r\nJuan is very grateful to his brother-in-law because, thanks to him, he now has his own business and an income to support his family. He feels at a  disadvantage in that his small farm is not mechanized, which causes him to incur additional costs, and the danger of pest infestations is a real headache. However, he feels he has an advantage in that coffee is a very marketable product and once it is harvested he can sell it quickly. He is requesting this loan to buy weed killer, fertilizer and to pay a labor force to clear the land. His goal is to eventually have 10 mz. of land (one manzana = approximately 1.68 acres) under cultivation and with the support of this loan he will be able to achieve this, little by little . This is Juan\u2019s first loan cycle at FAMA and he expects to fulfill his commitment to make all his payments on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":853371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer and weed killer and to pay laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Patuca, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-08-25T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10342.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257165372}],"funded_date":"2011-08-26T01:57:46Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:03:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":333285,"name":"Tarcila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tarcila is 61 years old and married with seven children.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She is married to Joseph T., an OFW (overseas Filipino worker), and the mother of three children, one of whom is in college, while the other two are in high school and elementary school. By the grace of God, Virginia has managed to support her older child's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send the other two to college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Virginia, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nVirginia maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct-selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and the difference makes up the profits that dealers are counting on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She averages a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nVirginia dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":567932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy orders for her customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-07-14T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2698.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159608193},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2698.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821704},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":2666.7,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2698.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172088948}],"funded_date":"2010-07-14T21:22:16Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":218551,"name":"Tuvshinsaihan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tuvshinsaihan B. is 29 years old and lives with his wife and child in the Hovd province of western Mongolia.

La Paz, Bogo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and curtain sales. Her husband, Gaspar Jupiter P., 44 years old, works overseas to earn his living. They have 1 child who is 16 years old. Gina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital for her general store and curtain sales business so that she can continue to save up for her daughter's future education. Gina P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has 1 year of experience in this business.    Sivaimamao needs a loan of WST 1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Sivaimamao joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Sivaimamao's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She is a member of the Nueva Vida (New Life) Communal Bank and is 48.  She studied up to the sixth grade and has four children.  She also cares for a niece who was orphaned.  Her husband is disabled due to injuries he received in a traffic accident many years ago.\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, she works making women's clothing, such as various kinds of skirts and wool undergarments.  She sells her products from a stand in the 15 de Agosto Market in Yunguyo.  She decided to start this business because of her oldest son, who was studying at the Altiplano-Puno National University and couldn't afford what he needed for school, such as materials, etc.  In light of this, one of his school friends suggested that he learn to sew shawls by machine.  He told he mother about the idea and she immediately decided to buy a second-hand sewing machine.  Next, they both learned to make the shawls.\r\n<p>\r\nAt the time, Ms. Sabina only had two thirds of the money she needed to buy the sewing machine, so she went to Ms. Toribia Pilco to ask about getting a loan from the microfinance institute Manuela [Ramos].  She quickly decided to join her community's Communal Bank.  That's how she was granted her first loan of S\/. 300.00 nuevo soles [local currency], in order to pay for the sewing machine.  She is now seeking a loan of S\/. 500.00 in order to purchase different colored wools.  She will repay the loan in four months.\r\n<p>\r\nMs. Sabina is very happy at present, as all of her children have learned to sew.  This joint family effort has helped the family increase its income.  In the future, Ms. Sabina would like to buy more sewing machines and increase her business, becoming a successful businesswoman in the Yunguyo province.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Chegezy, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Sabina vive en la comunidad de Chambi Chocaque del distrito y provincia de Yunguyo y pertenece al Banco Comunal Nueva Vida, tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 hasta sexto de primaria y es madre de 4 hijos y es responsable de una sobrina huerfanita.

La venta lo realiza en el puesto que tiene en el mercado 15 de agosto de Yunguyo. Esta actividad fue motivada por su hijo mayor qui\u00e9n estudiaba, en ese entonces, en la Universidad Nacional del Altiplano-Puno, en donde no ten\u00eda dinero para sus separatas, cuotas en su sal\u00f3n, frente a ello uno de sus compa\u00f1eros lo anim\u00f3 a tejer chalinas a m\u00e1quina. Luego todo ello le cont\u00f3 a su madre y ella inmediatamente decidi\u00f3 comprar una m\u00e1quina de tejer (de segunda), y tambi\u00e9n lograron aprender a tejer las prendas.\r\n<p>\r\nEn ese entonces, para el pago de la m\u00e1quina le faltaba una tercera parte del capital, por ello ha recurrido ante la se\u00f1ora Toribia Pilco para que explique sobre c\u00f3mo acceder al cr\u00e9dito de Manuela, inmediatamente decidi\u00f3 constituir el Banco Comunal en su comunidad. As\u00ed accedi\u00f3 al primer pr\u00e9stamo de S\/. 300.00 nuevos soles para cancelar la m\u00e1quina de tejer.  Con este pr\u00e9stamo de S\/. 500.00 comprar\u00e1 lanas de diferentes colores.

Okhunbobo is the happily married father of two children. He leases eight hectares of land, all of which are planted with vegetables, as there is generally adequate irrigation all year round in the area. Thus, over the course of a year, the land can be planted on a rotational basis with potato, tomato, cucumber, wheat, and barley. Besides these, he has many fruit trees on his land. This rotational planting process preserves the richness of the land. Of course, it is also dependent on the weather. \r\n<p>\r\nFor cultivating land this size, Okhunbobo requires additional funds to increase his expected yield. Last season, Okhunbobo faced considerable difficulties in terms of supplying his land with sufficient water. He has applied to IMON International for a loan in order to ensure a good yield of fruits and vegetables. This is Okhunbobo\u2019s first loan and he is sure that his successful efforts will increase his income and improve his family\u2019s welfare. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She has a son, who is 23. The son is a member of a farm association. She and her son make their living by raising cattle. Three years ago, Mira bought some sheep and started breeding. In spite of all the difficulties, she was able to save $340 and invest in purchasing cattle. Now her monthly income constitutes around $135. Mira has applied for this loan as she hopes to buy a cow to feed and subsequently sell its milk. This coming fall, she plans to marry her son. \r\n\r\nIt is refreshing to see how people of a relatively old age show this much perseverance and genuine desire to achieve success in their businesses. They are like the runner who has run all the way and, when everybody expects he will fall down from exhaustion and fatigue, suddenly looks ahead and with a smile begins to pick up his pace. \r\n\r\nMira is the leader of this group. Mira\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nGulsyina, 51, is a widow. She has two children. To make a living, Gulsyina keeps some cattle. Her children provide a tremendous help looking after the cattle. Gulsyina's monthly income from trading in cattle is around $95. Gulsyina needs a loan to invest in increasing the total population of her livestock. \r\n\r\nToktobubu, 48, is married and has two children. Her husband is an electrician. They keep cattle and sell some of their livestock from time to time to meet their needs. Toktobubu needs a loan to invest in purchasing more cattle. \r\n\r\nJyldyz, 49, is divorced. She is the mother of three children. All the children help their mother look after the livestock. The eldest son is a farmer; the other two children still go to school. Jyldyz has applied for this loan to increase the total population of her livestock. \r\n\r\n======================================\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3 P's concept: <b>P<\/b>eople (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), <b>P<\/b>rofit (to be profitable to grow further) and the <b>P<\/b>lanet (taking care of the environment).

She has a restaurant located in front of her house. She has managed this business for 9 months and is being assisted by her husband in spite of his work as a shoe-shiner down-town. \r\n\r\nBefore being a member of the foundation she worked as a maid. Once she started with loans from Espoir she was able to set up her own business. She starts selling at 3 o\u00b4clock in the afternoon, she has \"chuzo\" (grilled meat on a stick) as well as dishes with rice, vegetable stew, and grilled meat.\r\n \r\nOur partner tells us that with this new loan she will be able to buy an industrial kitchen, chairs and tables to offer more comfort to her customers. She started with 50 dollars and was able to start her restaurant, motivated by the husband, she did not think it twice, and since then her sales have gone well.\r\n\r\nWe visited the partners the last day of the cycle and to know more about the work of Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir, we talked to Mrs. Ela, married with  5 grown-up children. She is 56 years old and for 15 years she has had a general store located at her house. Since she was a young girl her parents have had this business down-town, and then when she married she followed the tradition, and now she is the one running the store. Her husband is a professional journalist and in his free time he helps her. Mrs. Ela tells us that she does not have any free time, she works from 6 am till midnight. \r\n\r\nWith this new loan she will invest in products for her store such as rice, sugar, meat, beverages such as beer and sodas among others, she invests approximately 300 dollars per week. Mrs Ela tells us that her grandchildren, whom she adores, live with her and they help sell. It is our partner\u00b4s dream to continue with her store and keep the family united.\r\n\r\nWe also talked to Miss Karina who is 33 years old, born in Portoviejo, a lawyer who also has a store at home which her mother looks after.\r\n\r\nWith the money of the loan she will invest in providing her store with essential products and beverages such as beer, water, and coca-colas. She opens her store very early and closes at 8 o\u00b4clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nMiss Karina is satisfied with her work which provides her with good profit, she has the support of her brothers who are in charge of managing the orders to the distributors. Approximately 300 dollars are invested in supplies per week. It is our partner\u00b4s dream to travel to other places as she likes to learn about other cultures.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lene Struck Christensen, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":533982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase rice, sugar, beverages, meet, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3750,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karla Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gisela Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Genoveva Lucinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ela Argentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatima Mabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yessenia Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mireya Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramon Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Auxiliadora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith Daisy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3740,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":467.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":467.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":467.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":467.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":467.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":467.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":467.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":467.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":468.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"lene struck","image":881505}},{"id":202181,"name":"O\u00f1ondivepa Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El presente comit\u00e9 se form\u00f3 gracias a  las ganas que tienen las integrantes para trabajar en grupo y ayudarse de alguna manera para seguir progresando, ella se encuentran en plena actividad dentro del octavo ciclo del programa Comit\u00e9 de Mujeres Emprendedoras.\nLa venta de comestibles es una actividad que realiza muchas mujeres en Paraguay entre ella se encuentra la se\u00f1ora Ramona quien prepara alimentos de diversos tipos para vender.\nLa venta de sus comestibles lo realiza en forma ambulante recorriendo las zonas concurridas como plazas, mercados y otros, y de esa manera ella vende los productos que prepara cada d\u00eda.\nSu desea es contar con un puesto de venta dentro del mercado para tener un lugar definido para trabajar, pero asegura que en unos meses trabajando mucho lograr\u00e1 su objetivo.\nEn esta oportunidad solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de ingredientes como carne, harina de ma\u00edz, fideos, panificados y otros.\n\n","en":"This group got together thanks to a shared desire to work in a group and help each other to get ahead.

F. is a 51-year-old pepper producer and father of nine who lives in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles de San Carlos, located in Northern Costa Rica. Lucio is a dedicated producer and father. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvest of Tabasco peppers. He works in cooperation with his wife to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land they work is their own. \r\n\r\nIn addition to his agricultural activity, Lucio works at a local Orange producing factory as a harvesting labourer in order to supplement family income. The money he earns helps pay bills for electricity and to buy food. The rural zone where Lucio and his family live is one of the few places in Costa Rica without running water; the family must pump water from a nearby well as needed. Lucio is working hard towards the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labour. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Lucio and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbours help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Coquital community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Tabasco peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of seedlings and necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labourial and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Lucio with the help of his family members in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles, located in the Northern Region of Costa Rica. Lucio will need roughly one year before his peppers will reach maturity and be ready for harvest. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or, PROPICA is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Coquital, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nIn general, the work day is divided into mornings and afternoons. In the morning, the domestic tasks are carried out such as cooking, cleaning and sending the children to school. Afternoons are generally dedicated to harvest and planting, working the land as needed. Lucio spends some days working as a labourer in the nearby Orange producing factory, but this work is sporadic. Lucio says that he has had difficulty obtaining access to both financial services and technical assistance with respect to farming.

Sojidamo is a hard-working woman who is married and has four children. Her husband and son help her in her grocery sales business. She lives near the market of Sakhovat. She purchases goods from wholesalers and sells them at a retail price. Before, she did not have the opportunity for a wide range of goods, but now she has a large assortment of goods. Sojidamo would like to get a loan of 5,000 Somoni to purchase a new selection of goods due to market demand and to increase the assortment of goods in her business. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband Mario is 44 years old and their son is 14 years old. They help her with the business, which for years has been their primary source of income. She sells lunch foods itinerantly through the main streets of the region where she lives. She starts her day in the early morning to prepare her delicious and healthy lunch foods that she sells to her clients day after day. Thanks to her charisma and her kindness she has managed to earn many clients and each day they increase in number. She has decided to increase the variety in her menu with the objective of covering a greater demand and to increase her earnings.

She grows potatoes, corn and onions, primarily, but also raises livestock; she has cows and bulls in her stable that she cares for daily with help from her husband and children.  She states that she enjoys working raising animals because it produces better profits than farming.  Besides, she always has milk available to sell that her cows produce.\r\n\r\nFor this reason she\u2019s decided to increase working capital buying more cattle.  She found out about MFP through neighbors that invited her to form part of a communal bank and which today is a very united group.

Maite, age 17, no longer goes to school.  Jes\u00fas, age 18, no longer goes to school either.

She tells us that for the time being there is no problem.  However, the time comes that her lambs need care like deworming every two or three months.  She also gives them vitamins every two months so that they do not get sick.  When they cough she also takes them to the veterinarian to get the appropriate medicine.  She takes them to graze in the afternoons.  If she is not able do that, her sons, Maite and Jes\u00fas, help her.\r\n\r\nThis time she is requesting the loan to buy them feed and vitamins.  Modesta believes that if her sheep have grown well and strong her income will be even better.\r\n\r\nModesta\u2019s hopes are to continue thriving with her sheep, and that they continue reproducing in order to sell two or three sheep.  With the earnings she wants to fix up a corral for them.  When they get sick she worries because it is already cold, and they could possibly get sick.\r\n\r\n\"I am grateful to FRAC and Kiva for the help they have given me.

Her tie and dye fabrics are much sought after especillay by African women. Esther also works at Life in Africa with the invisible children bracelet project as a bracelet producer. she does earn an income that can help with the house expenses. Esther's challenge is that after making her tie and dye products, she needs to ask some one with a sewing machine to help her sew her beautiful into garments so she can put them up for sale. She then has to pay for this service by the sewing machine owner. If only she had her own machine, she would be producing lots good quality garments. This is the reason why she now seeks a loan in the amount of 800,000\/= so she can have her own machine and buy materials to do this work without her having to pay for the service.

After completing schooling, both she and her husband were unable to find good paying jobs due to high unemployment rates in Ukraine. The family was forced to look for other sources of income to provide for their needs. Yanina\u2019s husband went abroad in search of work. Yanina had always wanted to be self-employed so she decided to start her own business selling women\u2019s lingerie. \r\n\r\nShe has been in this business for about a year. Her polite manner and natural cheerfulness have helped Yanina generate clientele and operate her business successfully. Loans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have been a big help as she\u2019s established and begun to expand her business.  \r\n\r\nTo meet growing demand from her customers, Yanina is requesting a loan of $500 which will allow her to purchase more silk, cotton and linen underwear at wholesale prices. Her goal is to increase her turnover capital which will allow her to purchase additional merchandise at affordable prices. Good quality women\u2019s lingerie at discounted prices will attract many potential customers and boost Yanina\u2019s sales promoting the consistent growth of her business and providing stable income

","en":"Rahmonazar is 42 years old, married and has 4 children.  He has a higher education, but he was left without work after the fall of the Soviet Union.  He had to follow his father\u2019s steps and started raising and selling livestock.  He has been in this business over 10 years.  Rahmonazar\u2019s children help with the business when he leaves for work.  He works as a security guard at a train station.  Rahmonazar owns a dairy cow; this is why his wife does not need to buy milk.  He recently sold a young bull in order to purchase a more mature one, which will earn him a good pay.  However, Rahmonazar needed more money for the purchase.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

We believe that it should be possible to grant her a loan as she is a person who respects others, and she does not want to remain with the little that she has; rather she would like to grow to become a very successful person and show others that women without a formal education are still able to work.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Merchlewitz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":415414,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Capital Growth","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Totonicap\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":113,"posted_date":"2009-10-30T16:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Micaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":260.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103751002},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-29T04:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":260.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110638723},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-18T09:06:51Z","rounded_local_amount":260.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118035447},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":780.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136634413},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":260.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144668879},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":260.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151852695},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":260.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159591142},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":260.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166802187},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":260.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172072218},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":260.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177363725}],"funded_date":"2009-10-31T02:12:11Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:05:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Merchlewitz","image":188300}},{"id":152318,"name":"Erickson","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Erickson es un joven soltero de 23 a\u00f1os, vive en la casa de sus padres.

She lives in her own house with relatives and has no dependents other than her family.\r\n\r\nWhen Marta was young, she left Machava to move to Boane with her parents because they had machambas (small family farms).  After her marriage she continued living in Boane, where she started her business.  She works from 7:00 am until 6:00 pm everyday selling pots that she buys for 5,000 MZN and sells for 8,500 MZN.  She has no employees.  From this business she earns about 3,500 MZN per month, which she uses for household expenses and even manages to put something in the bank.\r\n\r\nMarta has never taken out loans from other banks.  She learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also clients here.  This is her fourth loan.  She is asking for 11,000 MZN, with which she wants to buy materials (zinc sheets, stone, cement, sand and other materials) to continue building her house.  Her previous loans were for 3,100 MZN, 8,000 MZN and 10,000 MZN, all for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay off this loan on time so she can receive more loans.  In the future, she would like to ask for more loans so she can finish her house and buy some type of transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

S. is 50-year-old married woman who lives in Bungyod Brgy 2, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living through her pig-fattening and general store businesses.\r\n\r\nTogether with Victoria\u2019s husband, Romulo, and their 8 children (with some of them already working and having their own families while the others are still in school) they have been able to grow the business together as the children help out making it part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nVictoria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her general store and pig-fattening businesses. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 4,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nVictoria is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 10,000 was used to fund operations for her general store and pig-fattening which had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 6th loan in the amount of Php 10,000, which she intends to use on her general store and pig-fattening. Victoria is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":495114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She has reached an old age, and specifically, she is already fifty years old.  However, Gulbayra is no hurry to rest.  Her three children have become adults a long time ago.  The oldest son is single and works at a company in Bishkek, and the daughter is married.  The youngest son is also single and works at a furniture factory.  Having such good children, any mother would have preferred to stay home and rest.  But this is not Gulbayra\u2019s calling.  She spends and has spent her life in a water funnel of everyday life, in hard work.  Currently, she sells livestock at the livestock market.  Gulbayra started her business five years ago, when she and her husband fattened and sold one bull and put the profit into turnover.  Now, Gulbayra is primarily involved in the business, but always uses her husband\u2019s support.  He works at a school.  And just like many employees in this field, her husband\u2019s salary is not high at all.  Thanks to Gulbayra\u2019s business, they live fairly well.  Gulbayra achieved a lot over the years: bought a plot of land in Bishkek (capital of Kyrgyzstan) to be used for construction, married off her daughter.  Her monthly income is about five thousand som ($110).  Gulbayra decided to request a loan because she wants to buy two bulls for resale.  In the future, she plans to marry off her sons, build a house and expand the business by increasing the livestock headcount.\r\n\r\nGulbayra has four partners in the group:\r\n\r\nDinara B. is thirty-seven years old.  She is a widow and has two daughters, both of whom attend school.  Dinara works as a system administrator at the city registry.  She wants to obtain this loan in order to buy an electric oven, DVD player and vacuum cleaner.\r\n\r\nJanyl M. is fifty-two years old.  Her husband is a specialist at the city registry.  And Janyl sells merchandise at a store.  She has three sons, two of whom still live with their parents.  Janyl wants to obtain the loan and buy two bags of sugar for resale.\r\n\r\nYrysbubu K. is sixty-seven years old.  She and her husband are retired.  Current life, however, showed that a person with desire and will can become whoever she wants to be at any age.  Yrysbubu is a businesswoman.  She sells cattle and horses.  She needs the loan to buy three sheep.\r\n\r\nBolgonay T. is fifty-five years old.  She raised six children, all of whom are grown and lead independent lives.  Bolgonay still works.  She makes women\u2019s knitwear to-order.  She hopes to obtain the loan and purchase thirty rolls of knit thread.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":508478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of two bulls for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kochkor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-03-18T21:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulbayra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dinara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janyl","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irisbubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bolgonay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10389},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10869},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":11372},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":11898},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12449},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13023}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.46},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.44},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":259.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":271.95},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":237.46,"local_amount":10389,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":10484.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715761},{"amount":248.44,"local_amount":10869,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":10968.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748608},{"amount":259.93,"local_amount":11372,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":11476.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931582},{"amount":271.95,"local_amount":11898,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":12007.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670595},{"amount":284.55,"local_amount":12449,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":12563.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884248},{"amount":297.67,"local_amount":13023,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":13142.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151382}],"funded_date":"2010-03-22T02:08:25Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":189905,"name":"United People Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marie W. is the leader of this group of five borrowers called \u201cUnited People\u201d.

He uses his motorcycle to transport his neighbors' crops to the city. Effrene has been engaged in his business for over 12 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Effrene joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Effrene has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to repair his motorcycle. Effrene is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be his second loan from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement his family's income. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is married and has one daughter, Nidia, who is 12 years old.  They live together in the community of Villa Quintiarina, located on the edge of the Peruvian jungle, where he has his own home built of wood.  \r\n\r\nEmilio recalls that during a number of years he helped his parents, planting and harvesting cacao.

This community distinguishes itself because the predominant economic activities are farming and raising livestock, as well as making plastic rope.  The group is comprised of 10 members.\r\n\r\nBIBIANA VICTORIA V. D. is one member of the group.  She is originally from the San Pedro el Alto area, and has lived in this community for 44 years.  She dedicates herself to making plastic cords (they are used for sports at the schools); she also works in the farmlands, and for her neighbors when they need domestic services.  Her customers are the bookstores of the neighboring communities, since she makes and sells her product by the dozens.  She comments that one of the reasons for her business\u2019 success is the fact that she always has tried to have her orders ready on time.\r\n\r\nShe is 44 years old, and finished primary school.  She is married and has 6 children, of whom only 3 still depend on her.  One of them is in preparatory school, one in secondary and the other in primary.  \r\n\r\nShe wants this loan to continue investing in her business, and to buy raw materials for several orders that she has pending.  She hopes that the loan will continue to strengthen her business.\r\n\r\nBibiana, as she is known in her town, hopes that her work will allow her children to continue their studies so they can become career professionals.  The loans, until now, have helped her keep her business supplied with merchandise.  In turn, her profits have allowed her to increase her income and proviD. a better quality of life for her family.\r\n\r\nShe plans to continue making rope but in a grander scale, which is why she requests this loan to increase her production.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: NERI F.
