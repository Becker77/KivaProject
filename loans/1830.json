She hopes this loan will help her to earn more income and be able to buy a motorbike for her family\u2019s use. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1927792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and pesticides for doing farming in order to grow her output","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Kang Meas District","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2015-07-13T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-12T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Savoeun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khoeun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khov","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ean","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":5100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-12T04:14:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":915116,"name":"Jose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jose is a policeman.

She is married and the mother of 2 children aged 15 and 27. She is illiterate, 42 years old and lives in Mali. She sells groundnuts. Sanata's hopes and dreams include having more money in order to increase her inventory of groundnuts, so that she can increase her profits and always meet her family's needs.\r\n\r\nLacking funds, she is turning to RMCR in order to be able to continue her business activities. She buys and sells her products at the weekly markets in her zone. She makes a profit of 10 000 francs a month. This loan will enable her to better meet her family's needs (health, nutrition, etc.). She has been selling shelled groundnuts for 15 years. One of the challenges Sanata often faces is falls in market

high school. It\u2019s productive for her \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store business, water distribution service, and barbeque stall. She runs the variety store and barbeque stall together with two paid helpers, while her husband, Robert, operates the water distribution service. \r\n\r\nBut this is a lean season for their businesses. School vacation is not favorable for them. Yet the couple keeps on and prepares themselves to recover some losses when the school opens again. Last June, classes already started and the demand for their business increased. Maribel wants to meet this growing demand and she plans to buy cases of soft drinks, other beverages, snack items and ingredients for barbeque. She will also buy additional water containers so her husband can supply more households in their community. A 25,000 PHP loan will be of great help to boost her income and savings. She is working toward owning a water refilling station in the near future. \r\n\r\nShe meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":407.32,"image":{"id":1927845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cases of soft drinks, other beverages, snack items and ingredients for barbeque.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Talisay City, Cebu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-13T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-12T12:20:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":191.68,"local_amount":8333.36,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":8656.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434048},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":4166.68,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4328,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954967},{"amount":119.8,"local_amount":5208.35,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":5410,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044816}],"funded_date":"2015-08-01T20:01:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Neil Garvin","image":835015}},{"id":915149,"name":"Benedicta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benedicta has owned her variety store for three years.

A trisikad is a three-wheeled vehicle just like the tricycle, but it doesn\u2019t use gasoline or diesel to run. Just the power of \u201csikad\u201d or kick makes it run. Simply put, it\u2019s a bicycle with attached compartment or section for passengers. At her age, Melinda can still help those low-educated but hardworking men in her community by hiring them as trisikad driver.\r\n\r\nThis time Melinda is the one who needs help from you. She plans to buy more stocks of grocery items and dry goods for her variety store. She will also pay for her trisikad maintenance to keep it in good condition.

Stiff competition hampers her income and squeezes her family\u2019s everyday sustenance. Therefore, she aims to improve her business further, and she appeals for PHP 15,000 in additional capital to buy more sacks of rice and grocery items for her variety store. She will also use part of the loan to pay for assorted fish to sell in the market. \r\n\r\nYour kind generosity will help her a lot in strengthening her business.

Every afternoon her older daughter, who is now 11 years old, leaves school to help her mother in the store, which makes Alba very grateful for her life. \r\n\r\nAfter seeing how life keeps improving for herself and her children, Alba does not have a bit of doubt about continuing to invest in her home. For this reason she is requesting a loan to construct her bathroom. She will buy a sink, toilet, shower, and tiles, in order to improve her family\u2019s hygiene and quality of life. Her dream is to send her children to college."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":240.92,"image":{"id":1917536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

The \"Caritas Sonrientes\" (\"Smiling Faces\") are some of the most famous pieces in the history of the city.  Presently, this group is made up of 9 people, whose business activities are:\r\n\r\nElizabeth and Iliana: Silver sales \r\nJos\u00e9, Leticia, Carlos: Construction Material Sales\r\nBeatriz M.: Cosmetics and Jewelry Sales\r\nAna: Grocery Sales\r\nBeatriz A.:Clothing Sales\r\nMaria: Food and Hosiery sales\r\n\r\nCarlos and his wife Georgina have two children.  The oldest is 5 years old and the youngest is 3.  Carlos makes a living as a taxi driver, as well as selling construction materials.  This business has prevailed in his family for many generations.  His parents  and brothers are in the same business, and they all invest their resources into it.  The family has 6 dump trucks that they use to transport gravel, sand, clay, or stone according to the client's order.   While Carlos runs through the streets of this small city offering taxi services, his wife is in charge of monitoring the truck deliveries.  With the profits from the business and his salary as a taxi driver, Carlos takes care of the household expenses to provide the best for his family.  \r\n\r\nEach one of the provided loans have been useful for Carlos, as they have paid for the license plates for his truck, as well as licensing and registration.  In this case, he will invest this capital in providing maintenance to the dump truck.  \"Working hard in a team as our parents taught us is what has allowed our business to succeed,\" notes Carlos.  The family business is the source of employment for 10 people in the community as well as providing builders with building materials for their projects, mostly family homes.  The main objective of Carlos and his brothers is to make sure that their business continues for many more generations.  \r\n\r\nThe members of Rio Blanco are grateful to VisionFund M\u00e9xico for the loans that they have provided since each on represents a new opportunity for growth.  \r\n. \r\n*This photo was taken at Letecia's house.

\r\n\r\nFor several years, it has been her daily routine to wake up early in the morning to start kicking off her business. She\u2019s been with a small barbecue stall in the market place at Araneta, an area in Quezon City. It\u2019s just a little admirable how she manages to be a full-time mother and a businesswoman simultaneously, despite her age of 64. However, it didn't matter for her as she really wants to support her husband, Danilo, in building their family condition. \r\n\r\nBeing in this business requires a lot of effort as income is really not stable; it depends on the customer's demand. But, since Filipinos love eating street foods, including such that Edwina sells, her business has very good potential for expansion. \r\n\r\nBut she cannot do that without you. She needs 35,000 PHP that she will spend in buying additional raw ingredients, like meat and other stuff, for her barbecue stall. \r\n\r\nShe is hoping that you won't hesitate to help her. She is assuring you that she will not waste your trust and preserve this kind of generosity that you will give to her. \r\n\r\nSomeday, she dreams of having a more comfortable kind of living and she hopes for more strength for her family.

Sari-sari (a term used for variety) stores sell different kinds of products from biscuits, candies, canned goods, noodles, products used for personal hygiene and similar goods which are involved in every individual\u2019s daily living. This is considered one of the most common businesses built by ordinary people since it provides commodities for people. \r\n\r\nGiven this fact, Nida was enticed to get in touch with this kind of craft. She is 59 years old and a resident of Araneta, Quezon City, Philippines. For almost 32 years, she has been operating a variety store business. She continues working with determination to pursue the needs of her family. Since her husband is deceased, she is faced with the challenge of being a single mother. However, she's making herself brave and strong for her children.\r\n\r\nThe income she gets from her business serves as a basic remedy for their daily expenditures. However, what profit they get from the business is sometimes insufficient. At times, she finds it hard to maintain supplies of various products due to financial incapability. This is why she is requesting a PHP 60,000 loan that she will utilize to buy additional products for her inventory. With more products displayed in her store, she can achieve greater income. \r\n\r\nIn due time, she hopes to have a better life for her family. She wants to save enough money to be able to send her grandchildren to school. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is comprised of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

You can find them in the same place every weekend to enjoy their delicious products, always with the best of service.  For his part, Jorge's job is to travel through the streets of the community from Monday to Friday to sell tamales and atole, a cornflour drink.  That way, while Santa is making food, Jorge sells it from his three-wheeler.  They comment enthusiastically that \"the secret to success is good service and how we treat our customers.\"\r\n\r\nTheir work has allowed them to offer a better life to their family, mainly to provide their children with an education.  Moreover, Santa decided to open a grocery store 3 years ago thanks to the profits that she earned from food sales.  Santa comments, \"I am in the store from Monday to Friday, and in my food business on the weekends.  Both of these jobs have allowed me to grow economically.  I am thankful for the opportunity of a loan, since it allows us to grow our businesses and be more successful.\"  On this occasion, she is requesting a loan to buy rice, beans, sugar, soup, eggs, oil, and bread, towards the aim of satisfying all of her customers.  \r\n\r\n*The photo was taken at Santa's store (the woman wearing a white shirt with sunflowers).  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4500,"image":{"id":1917211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, beans, sugar, soup, eggs, oil, and bread.

She sells cacao to people who produce chocolate and other products. She would like to continue expanding her business, by increasing her inventory. This would enable her to satisfy more customers and sell a larger quantity. She will use this loan to grow more cacao trees and to purchase cacao, dry and process it.

old, married, and she and her husband are raising two sons. She has a higher education. She works as a teacher in a local school, and she has been growing crops and rearing animals for many years to get income for her family. Thanks to her tenacity, dedication, and hard work, today Salima has four cows, 55 sheep, and two horses. She grows barley and clover on 0.8 hectares of her own land and 1.5 hectares of rented land. She has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy some bull-calves to increase the size of her herd.

She is married and has four children. She has been working for some ten years as a secondary school teacher. She has always dreamed of giving her children a decent education and strives to do everything possible so that her children could achieve this and become well-educated people. Olmahon's husband and eldest son work in construction and they earn a good income from this work.\r\n\r\nNow Olmahon's other son has gone to university, and they must pay tuition for the first year of his education there.

Her impressive career has included instructing, choreographing, and directing at dance studios for 10 years. Seven years of experience as a director of a dance center and another four years choreographing have made her extremely successful in the dancing business. <br \/><br \/>In 2011, she began working on her own business and is now the proud owner of Dancing Arts Academy. She offers a large variation of dance classes, including both classic dance and ballet lessons. Jackie also loves other contemporary and modern dance style sessions like Kidz Hip Hop and Teen Jazz. Dancing Arts Academy provides sessions for all levels and ages.

She is a 35-year-old woman of two  children who attend school. She has grown rice for 17 years.  She earns additional income as paid worker and makes traditional cakes  to support the family. \r\n\r\nThe main challenge is that pests are severely destroying her crop and she cannot earn as much income as before.

Kampong Cham province. \r\n\r\n She has grown rice on one hectare area of farmland for 40 years to support her family. She also works for others for a fee to earn additional income. She is now quite worried about her  business because of insufficient water to pump into the field and the lack of capital to support her business. \r\n\r\nTouch, the industrious farmer, is now leading a three-member group to take out a new loan, which is the second cycle of her with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

from MUK.   Nadi has become a big junk collector. He buys junk from his customers, repackages it,  and sell its to the recycle factory. He will sort the junk according to plastic or metal. He and his wife work together.  His children help with the business after their school day.  He can sell 750.000 \u2013 1.000.000 IDR each week. \r\n\r\nNadi\u2019s youngest child is in elementary school. Profits support the  children's education and pay for electricity. He is able to save money. \r\n\r\nNear this Muslim holiday, Nadi needs more capital to buy more junk because many people come to sell junk at this time of year.

They work hard to get ahead as a family and in their business. In spite of all of the obstacles, they overcome every day thanks to their desire to succeed. \r\n\r\nMartha is the leader and she has a grocery store. It is a small store where she sells goods in small quantities such as: rice, beans, sugar, milk, bread, eggs, soap, detergent, matches, etc. The business is located in her home and because of the needs of the business her work routine is about 12 hours a day in order to meet her customer's demands. Her goal is to stock groceries offered by her creditors and in the near future to obtain a better income. \"Cristos nos guia\" thanks Kiva lenders for the help they provide low income people in poor countries like Nicaragua that allows them to have a means for dignified work.

With the income she obtains she helps with the general household expenses, she covers her daughters' education costs and she has been able to make some home renovations. She also invests in buying feed, corn and vaccines for her animals. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy a female pig and seven piglets to increase her production. \"I am happy and thankful for the trust you have given us since we are not just a group, we consider ourselves a family,\" Perla B. says happily. \r\n\r\n* The photograph was taken in Perla B.'s kitchen, she is dressed in a green blouse.

Despite these tough conditions, Florida remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. \r\n\r\nFlorida is seeking a loan to purchase poultry.

With this loan, Florida will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profits. \r\n\r\nAn increase in income for her is timely since it will enable her to tackle high farm-related costs next season.

Her primary sources of income are selling milk, and through this venture she has earned a decent income.

She is an early riser and wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cow.

She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. \r\n\r\nRose is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand.

Actualmente vive con su esposo Pedro ya que todos sus hijos se han independizado. Desde hace nueve a\u00f1os Eufemia vende calcetas de manera ambulante, dentro de plazas, tianguis o mercados. La principal motivaci\u00f3n fue su esposo quien siempre ha sido comerciante y que a lo largo de su experiencia ha vendido distintos productos. El hecho de vender de forma ambulante, lejos de representarle una dificultad, le otorga mayores beneficios pues abarca otros mercados y esto da como resultado mejores ganancias. \n   El \u00fanico inconveniente de do\u00f1a Eufemia es la temporada de lluvias sin embargo, al tener la facilidad de movimiento, siempre busca los lugares en donde adem\u00e1s de cubrirse del agua haya m\u00e1s afluencia de clientes.\n   Con esta nueva oportunidad del pr\u00e9stamo podr\u00e1 comprar m\u00e1s calcetas; \"estoy muy agradecida con todos los beneficios de la instituci\u00f3n porque poco a poco nuestro negocio crece, y con las ganancias puedo reinvertir y sacar mayor provecho\" coment\u00f3 Do\u00f1a Eufemia.\n   La meta que tiene en este momento es continuar laborando para solventar los gastos regulares de su casa. Por otro lado quiere conseguir los suficientes ahorros para cuando su retiro.\n   Las otras integrantes del grupo son Guadalupe quien invertir\u00e1 en bordados; Maricela, en vasos de licuadora; Elvira y Florentina, en tienda de abarrotes; Elena, en jarcieria y accesorios para celular; Juana, en mandiles y batas; Carolina, en controles y Paula, en vasos de licuadoras y mandiles.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en las escaleras del quisco municipal, Eufemia es quien viste su\u00e9ter rojo y mandil verde* \n","en":"Rayito de Sol is a group founded in a community whose residents are kind and dedicated to their work. Most of them grow corn or work in retail. The members of this group are admirably congenial. They are all women who, aside from being homemakers, run different businesses in order to help with household expenses.  \r\n \r\nEufemia's cheerfulness and excellent enterprising attitude are remarkable. She currently lives only with Pedro, her husband, since all of her children now live on their own. For the past nine years, Eufemia has been selling socks as a street vendor at town squares and markets. Her main inspiration was always her husband, who is also a retailer and has sold different products over his career. Rather than a challenge, she sees working as a street vendor as an advantage, because she can cover more markets, which results in higher profits.\r\n \r\nEufemia's only problem is the rainy season. However, since she can move around easily, she always finds a place where there is not only cover from the rain, but also lots of foot-traffic and potential customers.\r\n\r\nEufemia will use this new loan to buy more socks. \"I'm very grateful for all of the benefits offered by this organization because little by little our business grows and my earnings allow me to reinvest and make more profit,\" she says. Her current goal is to keep working so that she can cover her regular household expenses. In the long run, she wants to save up enough money for when she retires.\r\n\r\nThese are the names of the rest of the members of this group, as well as the items they will invest in: Guadalupe (embroidery), Maricela (blender containers), Elvira and Florentina (groceries), Elena (cleaning products and cell phone accessories), Juana (aprons and house dresses), Carolina (controls), and Paula (blender containers and aprons).\r\n\r\nThe picture was taken on the steps of the town square gazebo. Eufemia is the woman wearing a red sweater and a green apron.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6100,"image":{"id":1825290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy socks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-07-13T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-12T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":6100,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eufemia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":95000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":6100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":11875},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11875},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11875},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":11875},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":11875},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":11875},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":11875},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":11875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3050,"local_amount":47500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:57:02Z","rounded_local_amount":47643.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768278},{"amount":1525,"local_amount":23750,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":23821.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701327},{"amount":1525,"local_amount":23750,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":23821.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204415}],"funded_date":"2015-07-14T12:37:58Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T17:57:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":910359,"name":"El Triunfo El Sauce Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL TRIUNFO EL SAUCE ESTA CONFORMADO POR DIES INTEGRANTES SIETE MUJERES Y TRES HOMBRES, MADRES Y PADRES RESPONSABLES DE VEINTE HIJOS.

Traditionally, her primary source of income has been eggs, crops, and a personal business and she has been practicing farming for the past seven years. Having done farming for such a long time, she has gained so much experience that she is always ranked the best farmer in her village. \r\n\r\nKenyans drink a lot of milk. This tradition is probably derived from tribal culture, particularly the Nandi tribe (Hellen\u2019s tribe), where cows represent wealth. \r\n\r\nDemand for dairy milk has been high and Hellen wants to take advantage of the market. Therefore, she is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Hellen has already identified the breed of dairy cow that she wants. She has planted so many trees on her farm that food for the cattle will never be a problem. Marketing of the dairy milk and dairy products will not be a challenge because she will sell the milk directly to the market and also to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Hellen will not only benefit from milk, but will also benefit from manure (cow dung) that will be used in improving the fertility of her farm, thus saving money that would have been spent buying fertilizer. Hellen has been facing challenges in accessing finances, but feels relieved, knowing that institutions, such as Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva, are there to make her dream come true. \r\n\r\nHellen chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low and is on a reducing basis. Hellen underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo and, during the training season, she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. \r\n\r\nThrough accumulated profits, Hellen plans to permanently improve her living conditions and to secure the future of her school-aged children by paying tuition fees for them. She plans that, through increased income, she will be able to buy more dairy cows and build a bio-gas digester and, hence, save costs incurred in buying fuel.\r\n\r\nKindly help out this Kenyan enterprising woman farmer with a loan!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":148.8,"image":{"id":1923774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality breed of cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-13T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-12T23:20:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3440.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3541.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3644.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3751.21},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3860.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3973.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4089.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4209.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4332.35},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4458.96},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4589.27},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4723.39},{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4861.43},{"due_date":"2016-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5003.51},{"due_date":"2016-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5149.74},{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5300.24},{"due_date":"2016-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5455.16},{"due_date":"2016-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5614.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.41},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.61},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.74},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.9},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.09},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.32},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.59},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.89},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.04},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.5},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.41,"local_amount":4241.33,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4259.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696588631},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":3438.35,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3453.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506911},{"amount":35.46,"local_amount":3545.54,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3560.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023767},{"amount":36.55,"local_amount":3655.06,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3670.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111863}],"funded_date":"2015-07-29T19:22:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":915593,"name":"Parveen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Parveen is a 55-year-old working woman.

She is standing in the second row, the third person from the left hand side with a raised hand in the photo. She is about 24 years old and lives with her small family: her husband, one son, and a daughter. <br \/><br \/>Nirmala has been engaged with a tailoring shop beside her own home of Patharalla for the last eight years. Her husband is also helping her to promote the shop. Through this business, she earns a monthly income of 9,000 INR. Her opinion is that, from this small income, it is very difficult to maintain her family. After that, to get sufficient surplus to reinvest in the business is practically impossible. <br \/><br \/>In the current market situation, the competition is also very high. Another big investment is necessary for the expansion of the business. Fund scarcity is the main concern. So, she formed a group for strengthening social relations and to access a loan for the expansion of her business.<br \/><br \/>She planned to purchase four tailoring machines, including a picot machine. She will also appoint two employees to make dresses, so as to meet the demand of customers. She hopes to get more and more profit from her business expansion and save money for reconstruction of her house. She also wishes to enroll her children in a better school for better education. <br \/><br \/>The other nine members of the group are also smart at their professions and also are actively engaged with different professions like auto rider, vegetable cultivation, animal trading, tailoring, and a grocery shop.

Meet Edith, a 42-year-old, very hardworking, honest, and ever-smiling mother. She lives in the Chuka area, in the central region of Kenya. Edith passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past seven years and has always managed to provide for her family. <br \/><br \/>Feeding the large family she has requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her large family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. Edith has identified a free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices in the recent past have been going up, so Edith, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learned that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. <br \/><br \/>Edith said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural-based loans and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo and from the training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. Edith hopes that through the accumulated profit, she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and secure her future. She awaits your kindness.<br \/><br \/>With your help this dream can be fulfilled."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":92.44,"image":{"id":1924078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-14T00:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-13T00:40:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.99,"local_amount":4498.56,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4517.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506915},{"amount":25.28,"local_amount":2527.99,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2538.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023770},{"amount":22.17,"local_amount":2216.7,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2226.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111867}],"funded_date":"2015-07-24T12:23:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":915614,"name":"Shameem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shameem is a 48-year-old separated woman and has been running a business of milk selling for many years.

Her store sells essential food items, and toiletries as well. Most Filipinos buy by-the-piece or by-the-kilo since it is all they can afford with their minimum daily wage.

A tricycle carries around four passengers. In the Philippines, tricycle is a common means of transportation.  \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan which she will use to add more grocery items like canned goods, coffee, eggs, instant noodles, beverages, etc. She wants to see that she offers most of the essential food items to attract more customers.  \r\n\r\nShe is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her, since it will greatly help sustain their needs, especially her children's educational needs.\r\n\r\nJerry Rose's simple dream is to expand her store. She prays to always have love and harmony in her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Being a single parent has not been easy for her, but with her positive and joyful disposition, she was able to overcome her trials in life.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, especially in the provinces like Cavite, the tricycle is a common means of transportation which carries about four passengers. Jeepneys and buses are limited. Very few people own a vehicle. The townspeople usually ride a tricycle from their homes to market, church, to their friend\u2019s homes and to other destinations within their community. They even go from one town to the other.\r\n\r\nShe is now humbly asking for the financial assistance of a 25,000 PHP loan to buy another tricycle. Tricycle transportation is really a need in their community. Adding one more tricycle for service will help improve her income and serve more passengers. She is thanking God and you in advance for your support, and it will surely help meet her family's needs.\r\n\r\nVirginia's simple dream is to sustain her business and God's traveling mercies for her tricycle service. She prays for abundance in life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Everyone knows her as Do\u00f1a Domi. She is, furthermore, a very hard-working person who has big projects for the well-being of her area. She has been married to Don Juan for more than 30 years, and together they formed a family with three children.\r\n\r\nThe principal activity that she carries out is the production of organic compost that she offers in two forms: liquid and solid. The compost is produced by worms, and the process is known as worm composting. It consists of feeding the little animals solely with organic scraps such as fruits and vegetables, which are transformed to obtain the final product, which can be used on any type of crop, since it offers many benefits to the earth, in comparison with chemical fertilizers.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Domi began her business thanks to the help of an agronomy engineer who trained her. In this same workshop, they gave her the first worms, and half a year later she already had her own. Now Domi has 14 years of experience. Other jobs that she has are selling ornamental flowers and raising broad beans, tomatoes, and peaches. Now she needs a loan to buy 50 flowers (orchids), olive oil, glassware, etc., since they have contracted her to make the flower arrangements for the school graduations.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, she is very happy and grateful to VisionFund because she has been able to make her businesses grow, and with this, her son was able to finish a professional course. Domi wants all the producers to be able to make their own organic compost, so that they will not contaminate the earth any more. She also would like to be able to acquire a truck to make her deliveries.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken just when Do\u00f1a Domi was finishing a bouquet for a bride.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":1911604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 50 flowers (orchids), olive oil, and glassware","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Lorenzo Toxico, Ixtlahuaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-07-14T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-13T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domitila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6976.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7287.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":7663.51},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8072.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":447.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":467.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":491.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":518.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":447.69,"local_amount":6977,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:57:03Z","rounded_local_amount":6993.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768281},{"amount":467.61,"local_amount":7287.48,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7304.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701330},{"amount":491.77,"local_amount":7664,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7681.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204418},{"amount":517.93,"local_amount":8071.52,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":8090.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291850}],"funded_date":"2015-07-14T15:40:12Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":910366,"name":"Eduardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EDUARDO: Es un hombre luchador, pertenece a la etnia miskita de Lapam-Llano sur, localizada aproximadamente a 80 kil\u00f3metros del municipio de Bilwi.
