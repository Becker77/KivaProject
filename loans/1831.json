widowed, and has two daughters and three sons. Ainakul has secondary education. She is engaged in animal and field husbandry in order to provide income for her family, having started ten years ago. Thanks to her persistent hard work, today her farm has five cows. It also has a land plot of 5.0 hectares, on which she cultivates clover yearly. \r\n\r\nAinakul's monthly income from the business is about 16,000 som (KGS). This amount is disastrously insufficient for living adequately and supporting her family. In order to further develop her farm, Ainakul has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to harvest clover, which will be used as livestock feed. Ainakul plans to invest the funds from the loan in the further development of her

She has completed secondary education. She is receiving a state pension now. As an additional source of income for her family, Payiskan raises livestock and grows farm crops, having started this business in 1986.

Currently she lives with her parents and thanks to them decided to make a living selling items for the home as that is the activity which they have performed for a number of years. In that way she learned to sell tortillas as that is a very traditional, typical food in the region. They say enthusiastically that \"tortillas should be missing from no Mexican table\". For now Maricela does not have land for sowing corn but her loan will help her to buy corn and gas.\r\nThese days Maricela is very content and grateful because with the profits she has the opportunity to support her parents with the family expenses. On the other hand she dreams of continuing to improve her business to the point where she can employ other people. The biggest motivation for her is that she has regular customers who help her to achieve her goals.\r\nThe other members of the group are Ma. de los \u00c1ngeles who will invest in sheep; Albino, in clothing; Alicia and Amelia, in household products, and Josefina, in a tortiller\u00eda.\r\n*The photo was taken in the community where the members live. Maricela is the one wearing the black hat.*"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4050,"image":{"id":1911777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn and gas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin Mextepec, San Felipe del progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-07-14T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-13T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":4050,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albino","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":63000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":4050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":506.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2025,"local_amount":31500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:57:03Z","rounded_local_amount":31632.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768283},{"amount":1012.5,"local_amount":15750,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":15816.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701332},{"amount":1012.5,"local_amount":15750,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":15816.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204420}],"funded_date":"2015-07-14T15:25:17Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T17:57:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susie Jackson","image":null}},{"id":915693,"name":"Mriwa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mriwa is a married woman with two school-going children.

This loan benefits the small group of micro-entrepreneurs where Aisha is a member. She says that this is the eighth time she has taken a loan with ID Ghana. She joined through an invitation from a cousin who is a member of the institution. Currently, Aisha has a business selling wigs, weavon and lace.

She is 34 years old. She is a skilled craftswoman and the mother of four children. She is married, but her husband is away working in the Russian Federation. The economic situation in Russia is affecting her husband's income and he is not always able to send the sum of money to Farzona that is necessary to cover the family's expenses. Farzona herself earns money from home in support of her husband and covers the children's expenses. She is a skilled seamstress and embroiderer. Farzona takes orders for sewing clothing and simultaneously does embroidery. She loves her work and after six years of working in this field she has become a professional in the business.\r\n\r\nFarzona's reason for applying for a loan is acquiring an air conditioner and refrigerator. Summer this year has become intolerably hot, and it is very difficult to remain in the apartment with her children. On top of all this, her refrigerator has broken and she has nowhere to store her produce. Farzona sees no other path than to apply for a loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":137.52,"image":{"id":1931476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal

They have good references since they have been able to fulfil their activities and financial obligations.

For 6 years Tal\u00ed, as she is known locally, has made a living raising sheep, a skill which she learnt with the help of her parents. With the profits she has made she hopes to build a bigger pen to increase her production because for the graduation parties lots of families will buy lambs for their banquets. \"My dream is to have a farm, because in the area there are very few people working in this activity, and I want to teach my son everything\" she says. \r\n\r\nOn top of this, she is currently working as a community teacher with the aim of getting a grant so she can study for a degree in administration. Having said that, she used the previous loan to buy feed, but on this occasion she will use the loan to buy a female sheep. \r\n\r\nThe Tamarindo group is infinitely grateful to VisionFund Mexico and Kiva for the opportunities for growth which they provide to all their clients, given that with the profits they improve the families' quality of life.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph you can see the members of the Tamarindo group.

The group's name was chosen because, for its members, this city is a symbol of grandeur, strength and labor, as in the phrase \"Rome was not built in a day\". The members are: Maricela, who sells shoes; Matilde, meals and snacks;  Norberta, underwear; Arnulfo, soft drinks; and Margarita, silverware and tamales. Ana runs a confectioner's shop, and Evarista a butcher shop. \r\n\r\nMatilde is a very hard-working woman. When she was widowed 7 years ago she struggled to provide the best for her young son, who is now 10 years old. In order to pay her bills she started selling traditional meals, which allowed her to work from home and not leave her child. Since then she has put out a table in front of her house with the ingredients needed to make her food. On weekends she makes tamales, because she has customers who want to enjoy their delicious flavor starting very early. With her earnings she can pay for her son's education as well as her regular household expenses. Mati, as she is called, will use the loan to buy pasta, mayonnaise, cheese, cabbage, chicken, pork rinds, ham, table cream and napkins. On weekends she sells more, because the local students are on vacation. \"Thank you for this opportunity that you are providing to us, because it is very important for our businesses\", she says. \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in front of Mati's house, where you can see her small food stall. She is the one who has a pork crackling in her hands.

De igual forma, decidi\u00f3 seguir los pasos de su madre y ahora realiza conservas con el objetivo de mejorar sus ingresos. El proceso de elaboraci\u00f3n le toma una semana, y una vez listas las vende en ferias, de casa en casa o incluso los clientes van hasta su domicilio debido a su calidad. En cuanto a la cr\u00eda de borregos, necesita comprarlos desde peque\u00f1os para asegurar su \u00f3ptimo desarrollo, despu\u00e9s los vende sin contratiempos pues ya tiene clientes seguros gracias a sus 14 a\u00f1os de experiencia. \n   Ana comenta que \"la cr\u00eda de animales es un negocio muy rentable, la fabricaci\u00f3n de conservas es m\u00e1s complicada debido al precio de la materia prima pero todo el esfuerzo vale cuando se ve el resultado\".

One such community is the Mazahua.  For example, they have been able to preserve many of their original traditions, as well as their language.  The residents earn their living in the fields and by raising livestock.  They are extremely friendly and have a love of nature.  The group \u201cNuestra Esperanza\u201d (Our Hope) is part of this community.  The name refers to the dream that many of the members have to improve their businesses.  <br \/><br \/>Ana Isabel is a responsible woman who is looking to provide the best for her children, especially that the three of them continue their studies.  She says lovingly that she comes from a large family.  Her mother made preserved fruit, so she learned the value of this type of work.  At the moment Ana engages in making leather, the same trade as her brothers.  However, she also continues to follow in the footsteps of her mother and still makes preserves in order to improve her income.  The process of making preserves takes a week.  Once the products are ready they are sold at the fairs, by going door-to-door, or as a result of customers who come to her home because of the quality.  Ana also raises sheep, so she needs to buy small lambs to ensure that they develop properly.  She sells them without any problems and has accumulated regular customers thanks to her 14 years of experience.  <br \/><br \/>Ana says, \u201cRaising animals is very profitable business, but making preserves is more complicated because of the price of the supplies.  However, it is worth all of the effort when you see the results.\u201d  She is extremely grateful to VisionFund for the assistance she has obtained.  With this loan opportunity, she will be able to invest in the purchase of fruit and sheep.  Among Ana\u2019s dreams are to provide jobs to other people, improve her quality of life, and provide for her children\u2019s education.  <br \/><br \/>The other group members are Ma.

These include sachets of shampoo, toothpaste, soap, snacks, candies, bread, repacked condiments and many other items. \r\n\r\nAntonia earns enough to provide for some of her family's basic needs but there are times that it\u2019s not sufficient. Thus she also ventured into \"load retailing\" or \"electronic load for cellphones.\" It is also a viable business because most cellphone owners use prepaid plans and only a few subscribe to postpaid plans. In a prepaid arrangement, a person can budget his or her load usage by buying a load valued at ten pesos. \r\n\r\nAntonia and her husband, Orlando, who is also a vendor, work diligently to raise their children well. They are not content to just make a daily living because they aspire to save more for the future. \r\n\r\nWith this forward-looking mindset, Antonia wants to make her business more profitable. She would like to take a loan amounting to PhP 15,000 to buy more dry goods and grocery items for her store. She will also set aside some money for her e-loading business. She is hoping that additional income from this loan will not only sustain their everyday needs, but will also boost her savings for their children\u2019s education. Someday she wants to see her business grow into a big grocery store. She draws inspiration from her co-fellowship* members who meet every week to share stories of their life and business and to draw strength the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

66, is married to Roberto, a retired worker.

Myrna still operates a \u201csari-sari\u201d or variety store to support and maintain her and her husband\u2019s daily household needs. She also aims to save some amount in case of emergencies, because she has no medical benefits and insurances as a self-employed worker. \r\n\r\nIn her store, Myrna sells dry and packaged commodities, with almost all of her products being essential household items and food. She buys these goods at wholesale prices, and then sells them by the piece to her neighbors and the local community. This type of store is very common in the Philippines, and expectedly the competition is stiff. Myrna tries to compete and she wants to enhance it further. \r\n\r\nShe is applying for a PHP 12,000 loan, which she will use to buy more grocery items such as canned goods, instant noodles, sachets and packs of toiletries, and many others.

Yes, used clothes are being sold in the Philippines, but these are of course in good condition and are usually branded.  It\u2019s quite in demand due to its low, low prices. At the onset of this business, used clothes were literally piled on top of a table or floor and customers would dig deep to get their choice clothes.

She operates a store of used clothes at the public market of Barotac Viejo, Iloilo. She offers jeans, slack pants, shorts, shirts, blouses, and household items like bed sheets, blankets and comforters. Now she would like to add more selections of hot items to entice the buyers. She needs PHP 20,000 additional capital to procure boxes of used clothes. She hopes you are willing to help her, so she can increase her profits, sustain her family\u2019s daily needs, and boost her savings. \r\n\r\nKay is married to John Herbert and they have three children. Her husband helps her in her ukay-ukay business. They both work hard to provide for the completion of their children\u2019s education. They also want to finish the construction of their house soon.

He lives with his parents and brothers, who are his main priority.  He wants to use his loan to buy good quality bean seeds so that they will germinate well, to buy organic fertilizer that will help to improve the soil conditions and other products to apply during planting, to pay for labor to prepare the land and help make sure that the rain won't cause erosion damage, and to apply products and assist with planting once the seeds have developed.  These investments will allow him to make sure that his work goes well.  \r\n\r\nHe intends to take advantage of the good climactic and soil conditions found in this area for this crop, and also to put into practice several years of  experience growing for basic grains.

She has a business selling groceries and basic essentials in her neighbourhood shop. She is enterprising, optimistic, attentive, committed to her work, sociable, friendly, responsible and very hard-working. She runs her business in the southern part of the city, an area characterised by intense economic activity which arose from the establishment of the largest markets with numerous arcades and commercial outlets. The area has a warm sub-tropical climate with a temperature which varies from 21 to 35 degrees Centigrade during the day. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has a dark complexion, brown eyes and short curly hair and is short in stature and physically robust. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed which is spoken locally and for business she mainly speaks Spanish. She shares her life with her family members who are working and they live in a rented house built of brick and cement with a corrugated metal roof and cement floor. It has running water, electricity and sewerage. Her business is selling groceries and basic necessities such as milk, juices, bread, sugar, noodles, rice, soft drinks, biscuits, cleaning products etc. in her neighbourhood shop. Because there aren't many businesses in the area she has no direct competition. She carries out her work independently every day of the week with regular daily hours. \"With my business we pay part of the family's expenses. I want to stock up so I can sell more...\" she says.

After deducting the loan payment, feed and medicines, Ni Komang earned a net profit 1,900,000 IDR for six months. This income supported her family\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nFeeling the benefits of  this business, the Karanjung Indah group are continuing their loan. They still need capital to support and increase their pig population. Ni Komang used her portion of the loan to purchase superior piglets only. She bought feed and medicines with her own money. To reduce the cost, Ni Komang still uses the traditional feed, which she combines with a superior feed. Her experiences from the training she had from MUK make sure she can manage the pigs well. Her dream is to renovate her house from the profits of the pig business. Now she will save all the profits to make her dream come true.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1930175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase superior piglets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung_Bali_Indonesia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2015-07-15T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-14T10:20:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"I Gusti Ayu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":17500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":17500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-07-23T12:30:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ruth Lacey","image":1946071}},{"id":916165,"name":"Mekar Jadi Pondoan Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ni Ketut, head of the Mekar Jadi Pondoan Group, is responsible for the repayment to MUK. \r\n\r\nNi Ketut sold all of her fattening pigs which she had been feeding for 6 months.

She is 35 years old. She is married and is raising three children. Mahbuba has decided to find work and earn money due to the family's financial position. Without a higher education she has not found work, but she has not lost her head. She has decided to open her own business and work for herself.

admirable man.  He has always lived for the sake of his family and has devoted his whole life to them.  He is also a righteous and educated man.  He is infinitely grateful to his parents for the life that he has.  His father is retired but still teaches Russian.  His mom is also retired but used to work as a physician.  Alisher's role-model has always been his own father who was an exceptional cook. When he was young, Alisher used to watch him prepare dishes and he now cooks likes his dad.  Alisher now has his own restaurant and works as a cook.  He believes that this is his life's vocation.\r\n\r\nAlisher has had a good life among his family, until the day his brother Dzhamshed started to experience health problems.  Dzhamshed now needs a hip surgery.  The whole family is supporting him and no-one is letting him down, especially not Alisher.  Dzhamshed needs about 12,000 USD for his surgery.

The fertile land and huge forested areas are favorable to fruit-bearing trees as well as vegetable farming. The tropical weather conditions in Davao, or Mindanao region in general, is more stable compared to Visayas region. Typhoons seldom visit the area. \r\n\r\nAmelita, 41, has a stall selling fruits and vegetables in Davao City. She also runs a food house that offers snacks and usual viands. The profits derived from her business helps provide for the basic needs of her family. However, the risk that she faces is the possibility of rotting if her fruits and vegetables are not sold on time. Amelita has learned the trade tips from her nine years of experience in fruit vending. Now she desires to buy more products to display in her stall in order to attract more buyers. Aside from this, she plans to renovate the space for her food house to adopt to the rainy season. She implores your kind support to make these things possible. A loan worth PHP 40,000 will surely go a long way. May you be God\u2019s blessing to her as she aspires to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAmelita is married to Zaldy and they have children, one of whom cannot talk or walk until now due to congenital disease. It\u2019s a huge challenge for the family but it keeps them united towards the goal to uplift their lives, finish their schooling, improve their business, and acquire their own house and lot.\r\n\r\nAmelita is a devoted member of CCT Credit Cooperative and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance
