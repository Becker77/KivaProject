She began this business five years ago, when her husband was diagnosed with chronic illness and was advised to undergo hemodialysis. He refused and went home. A friend of the family commented that this product could help him with his health.

Unfortunately, due to the lack of economic resources, they were not able to study and found themselves with the need to work at an early age in order to help with household expenses.

No es raro observar en la carretera los carros ca\u00f1eros, las alzadoras, los tractores, las camionetas o motos que llevan almuerzos a las cuadrillas de cortadores de la ca\u00f1a. Una vez terminada la temporada, la regi\u00f3n festeja con un gran baile donde la entrada es gratuita para las mujeres.\n   El grupo La Uni\u00f3n debe el nombre al dicho de que \u201cla uni\u00f3n hace la fuerza\u201d pues todos llevan una fuerte relaci\u00f3n de amistad y desean proyectar su \u00e9xito a todas las actividades que realizan. Ellos son: Mar\u00eda O. quien vende refrescos; Mar\u00eda N., pollos asados; Irayda, pi\u00f1atas y cosm\u00e9ticos; Leidy, ropa y comida; Laura, comida; Martin, pollo rostizado y Vicente que brinda servicios de alba\u00f1iler\u00eda.\n   Irayda  es una mujer muy comprometida y segura de s\u00ed misma, es madre soltera de una peque\u00f1a de  6 a\u00f1os de edad. La \u201cTota\u201d, como es mejor conocida, tiene el prop\u00f3sito fundamental de ofrecer lo mejor a su peque\u00f1a y por ello decidi\u00f3 iniciar con la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos por cat\u00e1logo desde hace 5 a\u00f1os. Al inicio s\u00f3lo era ayudante pero gracias a su esfuerzo ahora es vendedora directa.\n   De igual forma durante su tiempo libre se dedica hacer pi\u00f1atas de toda forma y color dependiendo del gusto de sus clientes. En el mes de octubre, en cambio, inicia con la elaboraci\u00f3n de coronas florales para los funerales. Con las ganancias obtenidas de todas sus actividades solventa los gastos del hogar e invierte en nuevas labores como la venta de naranjas y pl\u00e1tanos dependiendo de la temporada.\n   Esta vez el pr\u00e9stamo lo empleara en la compra de globos, papel crepe, china, celof\u00e1n, papel peri\u00f3dico, adem\u00e1s en la compra de cosm\u00e9ticos tales como: delineadores, r\u00edmel, sombras, cremas y labiales. \u201cGracias a la inversi\u00f3n de los pr\u00e9stamos a mi ni\u00f1a y a m\u00ed no nos falta nada\u201d son sus palabras.\n   El grupo La Uni\u00f3n est\u00e1 agradecido con VisionFund y sus colaboradores por hacer posible tener nuevas oportunidades de crecimiento.\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en casa de do\u00f1a Laura, La Tota es quien viste blusa rosa.\n","en":"In a community in Oaxaca, the zafra, that is, the sugar production, season is traditional. It is not rare to see cane trucks, cane lifters, tractors, and trucks or motorcycles that bring lunch to the cane-cutting crews on the highway. Once the season is over, the region celebrates with a great dance to which the entry is free for women.\r\n\r\nThe group La Uni\u00f3n owes its name to the saying that \u201cunity makes strength\u201d since all have a strong friendship and they wish to extend their success to all of the activities that they carry out. They are: Mar\u00eda O. who sells soft drinks; Mar\u00eda N., grilled chicken; Irayda, pi\u00f1atas and cosmetics; Leidy, clothing and food; Laura, food; Martin, roast chicken; and Vincent, who provides bricklaying services.\r\n\r\nIrayda is a very committed and self-assured. She is a single mother of a little girl who is 6 years old. \u201cTota,\u201d as she is better-known, has the fundamental intention of offering the best to her daughter and because of this she decided to begin selling cosmetics by catalog 5 years ago. In the beginning, she was only an assistant, but thanks to her effort, she is now a direct seller.\r\n\r\nAlso, during her free time, she makes a living making pi\u00f1atas in all forms and colors depending on her customers\u2019 taste. In the month of October, however, she begins the production of floral crowns for funerals. With the profits obtained from all of her activities she pays her home expenses and invests in new work such as the sale of oranges and bananas, depending on the season.\r\n\r\nThis time, she will employ the loan in the purchase of balloons, crepe paper, china, cellophane, newspaper, as well as in the purchase of cosmetics such as: eyeliners, mascara, eye shadows, creams, and lipsticks. \u201cThanks to the investment of the loans my daughter and I lack nothing,\u201d are her words.\r\n\r\nThe group La Uni\u00f3n is thankful to VisionFund and its contributors for making it possible for it to have new growth opportunities.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in Laura\u2019s house, and Tota is wearing a pink

For two months she has been renting a 7-room home in a more prosperous area, which is now up and running, but she needs a loan to move her furniture from the old rooms and get all the rooms ready to rent. She has been in this business for 20 years, and in spite of the changes she insists that she enjoys her work and wants to continue in this field. She feels that it is more stable than other types of work, and currently she hopes to rent rooms to students as well as salesmen."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":193.85,"image":{"id":1905488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hotel","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded

He lives in his parents' home.  He finished primary school with much effort and sacrifice from his parents, and when they were not able to continue giving this so that he could continue studying, he had to find his first job.  \r\n\r\nHe currently works as a bricklayer assistant.  For some time, he also has helped his parents with rearing and caring for animals, and with this experience that he has had, he wants to have his own animals.  For this, he is requesting a loan to start his business.  The greatest obstacle in his life has been that due to his young age he has never been able to receive a loan to start his small business.\r\n\r\nFranklin has been providing all the economic support for his family.  It is because of this that his mother always supports him in whatever decision he makes.  Having seen the economic situation of his home, more than continuing to work, he will take charge of his own business.  Later, he will have the help of one of his siblings, and a friend who at the moment does not have the support of any financial organization.  He came to Fundaction Alternativa since his mother is a client of theirs.  \r\n\r\nHe gives a warm and effusive thanks to Kiva for making the growth of his work and personal life possible.  With the money that we fund him, he will be able to achieve one of his greatest dreams.

Janette from Davao City tries combining her variety store with direct selling of Avon products such as lotion, perfumes, powder and other personal necessities. <br \/><br \/>Not only does she run the store, she also converted part of their house into a boarding house and ventured into load retailing for cellphones. In this way, her boarders have a one-stop-shop. Somehow her income provides for their daily expenditures and the higher education needs of one of her children. Janette is also preparing for the college education of her younger children. She has to improve her store by obtaining more supplies of grocery items and beverages. She is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan for this purpose. Part of the loan will be allotted to her e-loading and direct selling businesses. <br \/><br \/>In due time, she hopes that her enterprises will progress and will give her family a comfortable life.

","en":"Salia is from Mali and is 34 years old. He did not get a chance to attend school. He is light-skinned and is the father of two children, both daughters. They are both in school. Since he was able to make some bricks with prior savings, his dream is to buy sheet metal and build a good house for his family, and with that hope he came to RMCR. He's the man who is holding the rope  of the cow in the photo. \r\n\r\nHe is taking out the loan from RMCR to buy cattle to raise. He buys them at the local market and sells them at the same market after he has fattened them. The profit he makes on the cattle allows him to pay for healthcare, food, and clothing for his children.

As the group name suggests (it means \"Entrepreneurs\"), being entrepreneurs is the main characteristic of every member of the group. They have all set up a business on their own with the firm goal of providing the best they can for their families. The members and their business areas are as follows: Santa (tailoring), Mar\u00eda Izolda (selling clothes, cosmetics and tacos), Juan (accounting), Mar\u00eda (selling clothes and shoes), Emma (selling clothes),  Joel (selling chicken) and Maritza (selling snacks).<br \/><br \/>Mar\u00eda Izolda is the group's representative. She studied up to the third year of secondary school. She is married to Roque, with whom she has a son who goes to the local school. Everyone knows her as   Izolda, and it is because of her character that the members consider her a good group leader.<br \/><br \/>Izolda has spent 8 years of her life selling casual clothes for both men and women. She also sells various brands of cosmetics by catalogue. She received her first loan 4 months ago and decided to set up selling tacos made of pork rind, pork crackling, pork tongue, barbecued pork and \"pibil\" (seasoned pork). She says that she hopes to learn to prepare them so that in this way she can increase her profit. She has a stall located in the main street underneath a small awning, where she places three tables for her customers and on another she sets up the fridge with the tacos, salsa sauce, \"pico de gallo\" salsa sauce, radishes, peppers, lemon, salt, napkins, cocktail sticks, plates and anti-bacterial gel. The tables of the small stall are ready from 8 am, which is when the tacos arrive, and she finishes selling at 2 pm to return home, carry out her household chores, and visit her customers to display her clothing items and handle orders. <br \/> <br \/>\u201cI enjoy my work and I know that I can prosper, just like I have done up until now, little by little\". She uses her profit to help her husband cover the household expenses.

He lives in Zugdidi with his pensioner mother. Ramaz has been involved in the agricultural business from early childhood. His parents were farmers and this is a traditional activity for the family. <br \/><br \/>Sadly, due to lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Ramaz was unable to study for a professional career. He works hard on the family-owned agricultural land, growing vegetables. He always has high quality products which are sold to local retailers for a good price. <br \/><br \/>Ramaz requested a loan to buy a tractor and cultivate his land.

She is a 36-year-old woman who hails from Kandi. Her husband runs a hardware shop. Their elder daughter is now married, and the younger one reads in grade six. They live in their own small house at Kandi in Murshidabad district.<br \/><br \/>As the earning of Rupali's husband is inconsistent, she earns a living for the family by rearing cattle. Rupali wants her family to be happy and to have a good life. She has been involved in animal husbandry for a long time. Every morning, she milks the cows and then sells their milk at the market where the demand is high.

Su sue\u00f1o es hacer crecer su negocio para poder obtener todas las ganancias posibles para poder solventar los gastos de su hogar y no tener que trabajar en la capital dejando a su familia por varios d\u00edas. \nLos integrantes del grupo son Hilaria y Anafer quienes invertir\u00e1n en borregos y Gilberto, en reces.\n\n*La fotografia fue tomada en las escaleras del kiosco del municipio, Don Lucas es quien tiene la chamarra blanca con roja adem\u00e1s los clientes muestran las tradicionales artesan\u00edas bordadas que la mayor\u00eda de los habitantes tambi\u00e9n elaboran y venden para tener un ingreso extra*\n\n ","en":"The community where the members of the group live is a mazahua community where they still preserve their mother tongue. They are very kind and hard-working people. A large part of the population makes a living from breeding and fattening animals or cultivating corn. It is a place that is characterized by its large trees that are in the area.\r\n\r\nLucas is a very hard-working man of the land. He is 37 years old and has lived in a common-law marriage for 19 years with Felicitas. The two of them have formed a family with four children. Two of them study in secondary school, one in primary school, and the other in preschool.\r\n\r\nFor 15 years Lucas has made a living from breeding and fattening animals. He began his business to take advantage of the community\u2019s pasture where he lives and to be able to feed the animals. This allows him to save a little by not investing large quantities of money in feed. Since some of Lucas\u2019s cousins carry out this activity, he also has the advantage of having the support and experience of his family. Lucas regularly purchases his bull calves and 6 to 8 people from the same community keep them. \r\n\r\nFor the moment, Lucas needs a loan since he left to work for a time to the country\u2019s capital. His wife, who stayed to care for the animals, does not have the opportunity to take the animals out to pasture as often, and they decided that it would be better to purchase a little feed and hay for the three bull calves that he has at home.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very thankful for the loan because it really has been a great help to make my business grow and to improve my children\u2019s quality of life because now we are able to pay their educational expenses,\u201d Lucas commented. His dream is to make his business grow to be able to obtain all of the all of the profits possible to be able to pay his home expenses and not have to work in the capital, leaving his family for many days.\r\nThe members of the group are Hilaria and Anafer, who will invest in sheep, and Gilbert, in steer.\r\n*The photograph was taken on the steps of the kiosk of the municipality. Lucas is the one who has the white and red coat. Furthermore, the clients show the traditional embroidered crafts that the majority of the inhabitants also produce and sell to have an extra income.*\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":7000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1910.05,"image":{"id":1916588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase feed and hay for his animals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Jeronimo Bonchete, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-07-16T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-15T01:20:01Z","loan_amount":7000,"lender_count":206,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anafer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":7000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7068.08},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7240.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7596.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8108.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":8367.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":8891.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9214.18},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9666.44},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10279.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10645.47},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11204.28},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":11717.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":449.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":516},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":532.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":565.8},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":586.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":615.14},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":654.16},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":677.44},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":713},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":910.62,"local_amount":14309.76,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":14332.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701346},{"amount":483.43,"local_amount":7596.7,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":7608.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204434},{"amount":516,"local_amount":8108.64,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":8121.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291859}],"funded_date":"2015-08-12T19:03:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Tyler","image":null}},{"id":911391,"name":"Edison Alexander","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edison es un joven  de 26 a\u00f1os de edad,   el vive con su madre y una tia que trabajan al jornal.

En esta ocasi\u00f3n 11 escuelas requieren sus servicios, por lo tanto necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar carpetas, pinturas y folders.\n   Emiliano se muestra muy agradecido con los pr\u00e9stamos anteriores pues adquiri\u00f3 de forma inmediata maquinaria sofisticada como plotters, un equipo de c\u00f3mputo y otro de sublimaci\u00f3n, lo que se traduce en un mejor servicio a sus clientes.

There, everyone is friendly, and they are always ready to help anyone who needs it. He is very friendly, since he is always in a good mood. He has a beautiful family, which includes his wife, Azucena, and their three children, who are studying in the university, high school, and primary school, respectively.\r\n\r\nEmiliano worked for 16 years as an assistant in a printing business. This allowed him to acquire enough experience and confidence to go out on his own path. He said that he was tired of working as an employee, and he know that he could start a printing business even though it would be difficult. Now, it has been 9 years since Emiliano starting running his business, but it wasn\u2019t always easy. At the beginning, he only had designed some logos, because he didn\u2019t have the right machines. Nonetheless, with his earnings, he was able to get the needed equipment. \r\n\r\nNow, he makes calendars, cookbooks, invitations, advertisements, printed t-shirts, etc. The best season for Emiliano is when people graduate from the schools in the city. They ask him for printed booklets for the ceremonies and shipments of certificates. For this year\u2019s event, 11 schools need his services, so he needs the loan to buy folders, paint, and booklets. \r\n\r\nEmiliano is very thankful for the previous loans, since he was able to get sophisticated machinery, like plotters, computing equipment, and a dye-sublimation printer, immediately. These investments translated into better service for his clients. Nonetheless, he wants to improve, so he says that with bigger equipment, he would be able to do work for two more cities. He hopes to succeed in doing that someday. In addition, thanks to his earnings, Emiliano has been able to improve his quality of life, from food and shoes to remodeling his house. Also, his children continue with their education.\r\n\r\n* The photo was taken in Emiliano\u2019s business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":688.25,"image":{"id":1782738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy folders, paint, and booklets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-07-16T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-15T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emiliano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":918.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":939.71},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":961.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":984.07},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1007.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1030.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1054.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1079.18},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1104.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1130.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1156.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1183.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1211.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1239.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.51},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.72},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":186.65,"local_amount":2871.58,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:57:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2937.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768296},{"amount":147.93,"local_amount":2275.77,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:37:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2328.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701347},{"amount":207.29,"local_amount":3189.08,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3262.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204435},{"amount":146.38,"local_amount":2252.01,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2303.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291860}],"funded_date":"2015-07-20T07:26:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":916427,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane is a married woman who has two children.

Una de las festividades m\u00e1s importantes se lleva a cabo el 14 de agosto cuando celebran a la Virgen de San Juan, realizan bailes, comidas y se entretienen con los vistosos fuegos artificiales. \n   Juana, o Juanita como le llaman de cari\u00f1o, es una mujer que transmite su pasi\u00f3n por el trabajo a trav\u00e9s de su car\u00e1cter amable. Las actividades que desarrolla van desde la cr\u00eda de ganado ovino, la venta de abarrotes y la creaci\u00f3n de bordados artesanales.

The members are natives of a community with strongly rooted traditions and values. They are descendants of the Mazahua culture, and many of them still speak the language.  One of their most important festivals takes place on August 14th, when they celebrate the Virgin of San Juan.  During this festival they dance, eat, and are entertained with spectacular fireworks.       \r\n\r\nJuana, or Juanita as she is affectionately called, is a woman who conveys her passion for her work through her friendly nature.  She is developing several businesses, including: raising sheep, selling groceries, and making handmade embroidered items.  For her, everything is done for the benefit of her family, which includes her husband Leobardo and her 5 children, two of whom are students.              \r\n\r\nBecause her livestock work and her embroidery work take place during different seasons of the year, Juanita decided to open a grocery store.  \"My mother-in-law used to have a store, and this is why I became motivated to start the business, because I had learned a lot,\" she states.            \r\n\r\nThanks to this business, the community is better off because previously they had no such business to rely on to satisfy their needs.  On the other hand, Juanita does not neglect her other activities, as she has 20 years of experience doing embroidery.  \"Ever since I was very young I was attracted to handicrafts, and I learned this skill.\"  As far as caring for the animals, she feeds them punctually and makes sure that they grow without problems.  \r\n\r\nAt this time, Juanita is requesting a loan to buy more lambs, checkered fabric, yarn in a variety of colors, thread, needles, etc., to continue with her activities.  Juanita has no obstacles with her work, because she knows how to manage her time well.

This time of year is very good for her business since there are many graduation parties, and they tend to feature dishes prepared with lamb. In the same way, five years ago she installed a large greenhouse in her own home, where she grows tomatoes, lettuce, broccoli, onions and other products. \r\nCurrently her activities are stable enough to cover her and her family's expenses: \"Really the loan is a great help to me because my children can continue with their studies,\" Rosa comments.
