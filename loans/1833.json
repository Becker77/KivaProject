Eva Guam\u00e1n is a single mother with 3 children who are the reason that she continues to move forward.  She has sought a way to triumph in life.

One of these is to provide her children with a good education so that in the future they can become great professionals who will lack for nothing.\r\n\r\nEva wants to expand her pens to fortify her business. This way she can increase her production of creole hens, a business that she devotes about 3 hours to each day.

This is her story:<br \/><br \/>\"I was born on May 23, 1983, in Quich\u00e9, but I grew up in an orphanage in San Lucas Toliman. The first thing I ever made on my own was a pair of silver earrings. My husband taught me, so I could help him. I remember watching him work on his own until all hours of the night, and I really wanted to learn how to craft jewelry. I felt happy when I saw the jewelry I had crafted and how beautiful it was. It's not been easy getting established as an artisan, because silver is very expensive and it's difficult to purchase. But when you set your mind to it, you can achieve your goals. My greatest dream is to be able to buy a piece of land and build my own house, so that I may leave it to my two sons.<br \/><br \/>\"Thank you for your support!

Angelita learned about this business from her mother-in-law. Angelita is very motivated and pleased to be a member of the Trust Bank. She is requesting a loan to purchase ten large sacks of peanuts and seeds. She is determined to create more income and raise the standard of living for her family.<br \/><br \/>The ladies look forward to their monthly meetings, when they see each other and transact business on their loans. After this task is completed, they participate in informal educational seminars with a Facilitator from Friendship Bridge. They learn about all kinds of relevant subjects, like hygiene, health and nutrition, women\u2019s rights and violence against women. The ladies learn to manage their loans with information about budgeting, accounting, pricing, marketing and customer service.

Now it\u2019s time for you to meet one of Ruma's agents, Nur. Nur lives in Magelang, around a one hour and thirty minute flight from Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. Nur is happily married. <br \/><br \/>He owns a stall where he sells mobile airtime credits for his community. He knew Ruma from Ruma\u2019s sales executive, who came to his stall. He decided to join Ruma because he is interested in Ruma\u2019s system. The sales executive will be coming to his stall to collect the money. Moreover, his community sees him as a trustworthy mobile provider.<br \/><br \/>As the business grows, Nur is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva.

Most people are dedicated to growing corn and to raising animals. \r\n\r\nCatalina is an example of hard work. All of her life, she has been dedicated to making a better future for her loved ones. Her family includes Aurelio, her husband, and four children, who no longer depend on their parents. \r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, she decided to dedicate herself to making sweets, since most of her relatives are merchants. She remembers that her parents, since she was very young, motivated her to start a stable business, from which she could earn a secure income. \r\n\r\nTo start this business, she had to use her savings from raising and selling animals, such as sheep, chickens, turkeys, etc. In the beginning, she only had a small table outside her house and a tarp that covered her from the sun and rain. Later, the business grew, and now she has a stable store where she offers a wide variety of sweets and some snacks. \r\n\r\nNow, she requests a new loan to be able to invest in more sweets and maintain an extensive supply. Catalina earns a lot when children\u2019s parties are celebrated in her community, as well as in December when the traditional pi\u00f1atas are full of different candies. Catalina is very thankful for every loan, because without they, her business wouldn\u2019t have grown as much and she wouldn\u2019t have been able to offer educations to her children. For now, her only goal is to maintain her business and have it grow. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Isidra, who will invest in sweets and beverages, and Don Jos\u00e9 and Mar\u00eda de la Luz, who will invest in a small grocery store. \r\n\r\n* The photograph was taken in Don Jos\u00e9\u2019s store.

someday and that her boarding house will become units of apartment for rent. For now she can only offer a small boarding house and sell few quantities of usual commodities like toiletries, snack items, canned goods, and beverages. Sometimes she grills pork and chicken barbecue in front of her store to augment her income.\r\n\r\nUnlike a grocery store where customers instantly pay in cash or through credit card, a community store like Neza\u2019s has many debtors. Most of Neza\u2019s debtors are her boarders. They request later payment for store items, barbecue, and boarding house rental. At times, they just flee, leaving behind their debts. This bad habit of some boarders minimizes her capital. Now she wants to avail additional capital amounting to 50,000 Philippines Pesos (PHP) that she can use to improve her business. She will renovate her boarding house and procure more stock for her variety store. She\u2019s hoping that it will lead to a higher profit that can sustain the everyday needs and educational expenses of her children with Brian, her live-in partner.\r\n\r\nPersonally, she wishes that they will get married in the near future, and she would be happy to see their children enjoying a better career after finishing their college educations. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God.\r\n\r\n*All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay Micro-Finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":890.64,"image":{"id":1931147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to pay for the renovation of her boarding house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Davao City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"7.073056 125.612778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-17T02:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-16T02:20:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":281.28,"local_amount":12499.98,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":12714.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523647},{"amount":187.52,"local_amount":8333.32,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":8476.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434077},{"amount":187.49,"local_amount":8333.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":8476.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954996},{"amount":234.35,"local_amount":10416.65,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10595.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044843}],"funded_date":"2015-07-24T23:52:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julia Smit","image":null}},{"id":916878,"name":"Hajati","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hajati is a 52-year-old single woman with four children, living in Masindi, Uganda.

It is affected by the school schedule and presence of students to whom she usually caters. The past school vacation became unfavorable for her because a large portion of her customers, the students, were not there to patronize her canteen. <br \/><br \/>Now she aspires to regain her loss in time for the opening of classes. This season brings greater demand for her business and this means higher income for her and her family. To attain this, she needs additional capital of PHP 20,000 to purchase more ingredients like meat, fish, vegetables, seasonings and condiments. She can cook more recipes and viands that are enticing to her customers.<br \/> <br \/>Rizalina\u2019s source of inspiration is her husband, Eduardo, and their children. She also draws encouragement from her co-fellowship* members who meet every week to share life stories and Bible reflections. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She put in all her efforts in order to achieve this. To do so, she did culinary training. Although she did not have enough capital to open her business, Yorley managed to find the resources that allowed her to overcome resources and achieve her goal. \r\n\r\nToday, the restaurant has been running for three years and has loyal customers. With delicious, quality meals at affordable prices, the customers are not going anywhere. In order to improve her business, Yorley has decided to apply for a Kiva loan, her first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. Yorley will use this loan in order to carry out work to improve her business' premises and to improve the business's image.

He is married and lives with his wife in a small house. Rami works as an employee in the public sector where he gets a low income. \r\n\r\nHe wants to improve himself and be an independent entrepreneur, so three years ago he thought of starting his business of transporting goods in rickshaws. \r\n\r\nRickshaws (also called \u201ctuk-tuks\u201d) are a common mode of transportation for goods and people in the Gaza Strip, due to efficient use of fuel, which can be scarce and expensive because of the economic blockade.

He also says he would like to take out more loans in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":188.82,"image":{"id":1926979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy nets, buoys, resin, fibers, and thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2015-07-17T11:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-16T11:30:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.32,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#Orphan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Remigio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1546.04},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1678.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1655.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1673.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1758.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1778.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1787.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1851.76},{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1900.95},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1909.18},{"due_date":"2016-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1976.63},{"due_date":"2016-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2001.53},{"due_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2044.03},{"due_date":"2016-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2091.84},{"due_date":"2016-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2125.89},{"due_date":"2016-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2219.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.89},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.43},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.69},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.91},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.71},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.37},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.51},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.78},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.69},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.18,"local_amount":2136.99,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2198.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.81,"payment_id":711490533},{"amount":65.31,"local_amount":2465.64,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2536.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.44,"payment_id":731008619},{"amount":62.01,"local_amount":2478.14,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-22T13:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2548.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.07,"payment_id":754723105}],"funded_date":"2015-07-17T13:32:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

They just piled the used clothes on the floor on top of a mat. Sometimes, they had a folding table where they scattered the clothes. Customers would literally dig under the pile to get their preferred clothes. The word \"dig\" translates to \u201chukay\u201d in Filipino. This is where the term \u201cukay-ukay\u201d was coined. From then on, the business of selling used clothes in the Philippines was called \u201cukay-ukay\u201d. These days, the business has leveled up and used clothes are arranged in hangers in some permanent establishments. \r\n\r\nArlene, from San Francisco, Agusan Del Sur, is selling used clothes at the town\u2019s public market. She offers jeans, trousers, shorts, shirts, blouses, shoes, and household items like bed sheets, blankets, and comforters. Now she would like to add a greater selection of hot items to entice buyers. She is requesting 15,000 PHP additional capital for this purpose. Your generous support will surely help her increase her profit, sustain her family\u2019s daily needs, and boost her savings. She dreams of becoming a wholesaler of ukay-ukay in the near future. \r\n\r\nArlene is married to Johnny, who is a businessman. They have children. They are doing everything to provide for their children\u2019s needs and education. She is also a compliant member of CCT Credit Cooperative and meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to inspire and strengthen each other through the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1931193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy a greater selection of used clothes for selling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"San Francisco, Agusan Del Sur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-17T12:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-16T12:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.7,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":5274.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523649},{"amount":93.32,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4219.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434079},{"amount":93.32,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4219.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730954998},{"amount":46.66,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2109.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044845}],"funded_date":"2015-07-17T13:35:23Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dorothy Bendel","image":1215871}},{"id":911550,"name":"Jomaira Estefania","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Con 22 a\u00f1os de edad Estefan\u00eda es madre soltera, su hijo tienen 3 a\u00f1os, Estefan\u00eda vive con sus padres en el campo y se dedican a la agricultura y a la crianza de animales menores, Estefan\u00eda se dedica a la crianza de chanchos y al jornal de trabajo en el campo, Estefan\u00eda va a invertir el cr\u00e9dito en la compra de chanchos para incrementar su negocio para que sea mas rentable,  Estefan\u00eda va a  sacar sola adelante a su hijo ya que dice que ella es padre y madre para su ni\u00f1o, Estefan\u00eda tiene el compromiso de  educar y alimentar lo mejor que pueda a su hijo.","en":"At 22 years of age, Estefania is a single mother.

Instead she keeps on, focusing on her children\u2019s needs and the ways on how to grow her businesses. She operates a variety store combined with a small canteen, videoke rental, and Piso Net. \r\n\r\nHer variety store sells commodities like toiletries, biscuits and candies, canned goods, beverages, and others. Her small canteen offers cooked viands and snacks. Her customers may also sing in her coin-operated videoke machine or surf the Internet through her coin-operated Piso Net. Her business is quite beneficial for her and her children because it provides for their daily needs and educational expenses. It also gives her a sense of productivity and self-confidence that she can get through all the hurdles in life.\r\n\r\nNow she is applying for a PHP 15,000 loan, mainly to buy more stock for her sari-sari (variety store) and ingredients for her canteen. Your assistance will be gratefully appreciated by a widow like her. As a father and mother to her children, she has to shoulder all the responsibilities for them.\r\n\r\nShe wants to live happily with her children in Butuan City in the Mindanao region. She draws strength and inspiration to her co-fellowship members at CCT Credit Cooperative who meet every week to share life experiences and reflect on the Word of God.

The beautiful end products will be used as clothes, curtains, bed sheets, and many more. Basilisa from Butuan City is happy to sew various designs of clothes, bed sheets and pillowcases from nicely printed fabrics. She also makes school and office uniforms. This enterprise is very important in maintaining her household and providing for her children\u2019s school expenses. She is dreaming that this business will expand and grow in progress, and later on she will own a tailoring shop with complete equipment.  \r\n\r\nTo take another step towards reaching this dream, she needs your help. She would like to borrow a loan worth 15,000 PHP that she will use to buy additional supplies of raw materials like fabrics, threads, ribbons and laces, zippers, and other sewing accessories. From these, she can make more clothes that will bring more profit and savings for her family. \r\n\r\nShe is married to Gregorio, a municipal employee, and they have two children who are still studying.

She owns three tricycles. Her husband, John Rey, drives one tricycle to earn an income. The two other units are being rented by drivers in the couple's neighborhood. They earn enough to support their daily needs and the education of their young children. But if her tricycles suddenly encounter mechanical problems, she would not have enough spare parts and tools necessary for troubleshooting. As a result, the damaged tricycle would be idle for days, affecting her income and the income of the driver who rents it. \r\n\r\nShirley is still paying for the monthly amortization of her third tricycle; therefore this amount is still being deducted from her monthly income. Now she wants to pay the full balance so she can maximize her profits. A loan worth PHP 10,000 would be enough for this purpose. She will also use part of the loan to buy spare parts and tools for troubleshooting. \r\n\r\nShe is determined to enhance her business and operate more tricycles some day. This will ensure the future and education of her children, and their dream of owning a house and lot in the future will no longer be elusive.  \r\n\r\nShirley meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God. * All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her business is selling general store items.  She is understanding, patient, a good listener, supportive, responsible, and very hard working.  She conducts her business in the \u2018plan 300\u2019 area.  This place is known for its inhabitants who are descendants of the Ayores tribes, which are native to the area and the miners who are relocated from the west.  The miners adapted to the area and started working in manufacturing and commerce.  The area has a hot sub-tropical and very humid climate.  The temperature varies during the day between 21 \u2013 35 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nMaria has a dark complexion, brown eyes, and long black hair that is tied back.  She is short and has a medium build.  Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family.  She speaks Spanish with the general public and for the business she does.  (She is the first on the right.)  She shares her life with her husband, who works as a driver.  They live in a rented room built from brick and cement.  It is a corrugated tin roof and a dirt floor.  They have running water, electricity, and indoor plumbing.\r\n\r\nHer desire to improve drove her to lead a bank of people with businesses like fabric handicrafts, making weavings, selling second-hand clothes, selling tomatoes, making clothes, selling fish, and construction services.  They are in the bank to request a loan and improve their businesses.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling all of the things that the inhabitants need like fabric, food, remedies, clothes, saddlery products, tobacco, rolling paper for cigarettes, and herbs, etc.  \u201cI sell basic needs items.

She wishes to stock general store items in order to continue with her business.  This is the second loan cycle with the institution in the one year that she has been engaged in this business activity.

She has a restaurant that is open for dinner.  \r\n\r\nShe is a good mother and an optimistic, perseverant, patient, responsible, and very hard-working woman.  She is the woman in light blue who is kneeling on the right of the photo.  She is leading the group of entrepreneurs this time because of her need to improve her business.  The members of this group lead various business activities such as vehicle upholstery, fruit smoothie sales, cell phones sales, a key workshop, natural health product sales, beverage sales, and secondhand clothing sales.  They want to take out a loan and expand their businesses.  \r\n\r\nClara's restaurant is open for dinner, which is customarily eaten after 7 P.M.  She will vary her traditional menu and make sure that every day is different.  She notes that during the day she takes care of her family, and works on her restaurant at night.  The advantage of her business is that food is something that sells every day, and the disadvantage is that she doesn't have enough capital to buy tables and plastic chairs to serve more customers.  Therefore, Clara is requesting a loan to buy tables and chairs to serve dinner to a lot of customers.

On the farm she keeps cows and grows vegetables that she uses for both consumption and sale. This business has enabled her to raise her family. Salina's own upbringing was so difficult that she never had the privilege of attending school. She is seeking a loan to venture into commercial poultry farming. With the loan, she will acquire a brood of hens that will lay eggs for food, sale and hatching. This business is projected to significantly increase her income. The birds will also bring life into her home, as they will be free-range and scratch the earth for bugs. The money from the investment will enable Salina to afford basic needs and save up for the future. This loan will go a long way towards empowering her to become a better entrepreneur and improve her family's living standards."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":93.28,"image":{"id":1925446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-17T15:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-16T15:50:06Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.83,"local_amount":4783.18,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4792.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506939},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":4545.27,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4553.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111887}],"funded_date":"2015-08-13T22:54:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":909292,"name":"Marcela Norma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marcela es una mujer de 42 a\u00f1os de edad, casada, tiene 3 hijos de 8, 10 y 16 a\u00f1os, y su negocio es la ense\u00f1anza de m\u00fasica.\nElla es buena madre, emprendedora, independiente, autodidacta, responsable y muy trabajadora.

She makes a living teaching music.  She is an enterprising woman, self-taught, hard-working and always there for her children.  She lives in a southern neighborhood of the city, an area where many of the residents have only recently moved from rural parts of the country.  There are many small, often informal businesses, there.  The climate is sub-tropical with day-time temperatures that vary between 21- and 35-degrees, Centigrade.  \r\n\r\nMarcela has brown eyes and short brown hair.  She speaks Guaran\u00ed, her native language, and Spanish.  Her husband works for a private company and her children are still in school.  The family lives in a rented house.  The house is made of brick and cement and has a metal roof and tiled floors.  The house is plumbed and has electricity and running water. \r\n\r\nMost of Marcela's students are children.  She started her business 10 years ago and says that she is especially eager to teach young children and awaken a passion for music in them that she herself feels.  \"We created a series of lessons for children that are designed to develop the children's natural aptitude for music\", she adds.

Her motherly love has been enough to show her that she needs to work hard to help her children get ahead with excellent values and education. Peninah is a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who hails from Kapsowar, a rural town in Kenya. She has a lovely family that she really loves and cherishes. Peninah and her husband work as a team supporting each other, and have practiced mixed farming for the past five years. \r\n\r\nPeninah is seeking a loan to buy vegetable and fruit seeds to expand her horticulture farm. She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output. Loans for smallholder farmers with little irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. A few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Peninah. Through a group of 15 members called Kaplamai, Peninah has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Peninah because the institution believes that women too are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":45.21,"image":{"id":1925623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":" to expand her horticulture farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-17T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-16T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peninah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.57},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.43},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.35},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.83},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.21,"local_amount":4521.39,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4529.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023799}],"funded_date":"2015-07-17T19:52:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Courtenay Selden","image":null}},{"id":910324,"name":"Las Estrellas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Erika es una mujer de 37 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su pareja, tiene 2 hijos de 8 y 14 a\u00f1os, y su negocio es la venta de hielo y helados.\nElla es buena madre, emprendedora, dedicada, amable, fuerte, responsable y muy trabajadora.

Meet Victorine, who, with her partner, has become a very good smallholder farmer. They didn't just get together romantically. They joined their hands in improving their farm to create financial strength for the home that they share.

To afford a decent and comfortable life for her 3 children, she has been selling eggs and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has also been engaging in another small personal business.

She stated that what she like best is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 70,000 KES to buy poultry.

As a result of the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry sales to other markets. This will increase her income and improve her living conditions.

Margaret is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. With more poultry on her farm, she will produce more eggs for food, hatching, and selling.

However, over the years, the mother of 4 has developed a biased and passionate interest in beef cattle farming. Evaline is seeking a loan to buy beef cows. With your loan, she is planning to purchase a beef cow that she will keep and later sell to meat-processing companies.

Su negocio lo realiza en la zona Sur de la ciudad, considerada zona peri urbana. Creada debido a un desborde del r\u00edo, en la que m\u00e1s de 3.000 familias quedaron sin hogar, y con las pocas pertenencias que llevaban tuvieron que asentarse en unos terrenos bald\u00edos, para empezar una nueva vida.

She operates a bakery business.  She is a hard worker, friendly, responsible and always there for her children.  She operates the business on the city's south side, in a neighborhood that is only partly developed.  There are more than 3,000 families without homes here, many displaced by river flooding and forced to settle with their remaining belongings on open land.  The climate is sub-tropical with day-time temperatures that vary from 21- to 35-degrees, Centigrade.\r\n\r\nIsabel has brown eyes and long, dark hair knotted in the back.  (She is standing on the right in the photo, wearing a striped blouse.)  She speaks Guaran\u00ed, her native language, and Spanish.  Her husband works at the bakery, as well, and her children are still in school.  Their house is made of wood and has a metal roof and cement floor.  The house is plumbed and has electricity and running water.  \r\n\r\nThe members of the Sofia community bank banded together to support their small businesses.  They operate a range of businesses that include: auto repair; locksmith services; juice sales; cell phone cards; perfume sales; and soft drink sales.  Isabel and her husband make and sell homemade breads. They make the bread and other baked goods at home and then go out, working as street vendors, to sell what they make from place to place.  \"We make all kinds of bread\", she says, \"depending on what ingredients are available in the markets\".  Sales are steady, she adds, because people always need bread but the couple lack the capital to buy all of the supplies that they need.

He has 2 children aged 10 and 12.  Jacinto has a business making bed sheets.  He is a good father and is enterprising, independent, optimistic, responsible, and very hardworking.  He is developing his business in an area in the southern part of the city, which is the fastest growing region.  Here the economy is dominated by agriculture and forestry, and this is also the most important area for hydrocarbon production.

She started farming on a small inherited piece of land in Kerugoya and today, this humble mum sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has about farming, commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart and she is proud to wake up every day to milk her cow. Although she makes profits by selling milk, she lacks a proper dairy unit and is seeking a loan to build one. A good dairy unit provides a place where cows can relax, and also prevents them from coming down with diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather such as rain. Elosy believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production.

She has a printing and screen printing business. <br \/><br \/>She is a good mother, understanding, active, consistent, dedicated, responsible and very hard-working. Her business is located in the 'Mutualista\u00b4 neighborhood, a central area which houses the Camb\u00f3dromo, a space with capacity for 30,000 people. It is a thousand meters long and Carnival festivities, parades and other cultural activities are held here. It has a hot sub-tropical climate with a daily temperature that varies between 21 and 35 degrees Celsius. <br \/><br \/>Carmen  is dark-skinned, has dark eyes, long black hair that she ties back, short and robust in build. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she uses in her home and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and for her business. (In the photo she is the first person standing to the right wearing a black and white striped blouse). <br \/><br \/>She shares her life with her husband who works and her children who study in school. Her youngest one is not yet school age. They live in a room they built themselves of wood with a metal roof and dirt floor that has electricity, running water and sewage. <br \/><br \/>The need to improve their income led her to form a group of people with businesses like selling second hand clothing, selling flowers, sewing, selling eggs, selling soft drinks and a telephone calling service to request a loan to improve their businesses. Her business provides printing and screen printing and prints cards, flyers, bills, notes, invitations, posters, labels, tickets, etc. \"We offer our clients the best service along with the best product on the market, improving day by day so it can become the best option for all businesses\" she commented. The advantage of her business is that it has continuous contracts and her disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy work materials like ink, paper and others. <br \/><br \/>Her dream is to have her own shop. She wants to purchase printing materials to complete some outstanding contracts. This is her first loan from the institution in the 7 years she has been in business. For these reasons Carmen is requesting a loan to purchase printing materials to fill outstanding contracts and get a larger shop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":1918061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Su negocio es la venta de comida tradicional, labor que realiza de lunes a s\u00e1bado a la hora de almuerzo en su puesto de venta fijo al aire libre. La comidas tradicionales m\u00e1s demandadas son; majadito de charque (carne deshidratada, arroz, huevo frito y pl\u00e1tano frito), locro (sopa de: carne deshidratada, carne cortada en pedacitos, yuca y huevo), Sopa de Remojado (sopa de huesos), y otros, \u201cesta actividad me brinda la oportunidad de poder brindarle a mi beb\u00e9 la atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica que necesita\u2026\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que las ventas son diarias, la desventaja es la falta de capital para la compra de insumos de cocina, como; aceite, arroz, fideo, yuca, carne, etc. Su sue\u00f1o es ver sano y fuerte a su hijo reci\u00e9n nacido, ella desea ampliar su negocio mediante la compra de insumos de cocina como; aceite, arroz, fideo huevo, carne, papa, chu\u00f1o, etc., para continuar con negocio ya que sus hijos menores le dificultan la actividad. Esta es la 2 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 2 a\u00f1os que lleva desarrollando esta actividad. \nEs por esos motivos que Ana solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de insumos de cocina para vender comida y pagar los gastos posnatales de su reci\u00e9n nacido.\n","en":"Ana is a young mother of 33.  She lives with her partner and they have 5 children of 8, 6, 4, and 2 years old, and a 1-month old.  She sells local cuisine.  She is a good mother and a caring, friendly, optimistic, perseverant, responsible, and hard-working woman.  She carries out her business in the 'Plan 3000' Zone, which is characterized by the origins of its settlers, the Ayoreo people native to the area and relocated miners from the West who started manufacturing and trade in the area.  The climate is hot, sub-tropical, and very humid, with a temperature that varies during the day from 21 to 35 degrees Celsius.  \r\n\r\nAna has a dark complexion, strong build, grey-brown eyes, and long black hair that she ties up.  She speaks Guaran\u00ed, her native language, with her family and she speaks Spanish with the general population and when she does business.  She is the first one on the right in the photo, sitting down with her baby.  She enjoys her life in the company of her partner, who is a construction worker, and her children.  The 2 oldest in school, but the 2 middle children aren't in school yet.  The youngest child is a newborn.  They live in a rented apartment made of wood with a corrugated iron roof and dirt floor that has potable water, electricity, and plumbing.  \r\n\r\nHer desire to improve her life and pay for the postnatal expenses of her newborn led her to form a credit group of people with businesses in diverse areas such as fabric painting, candle sales, secondhand clothing sales, cosmetic sales from catalogs, empanada sales, appliance repair service, and a breakfast restaurant, who want to take out a loan and improve their businesses.  She sells traditional food, a job that she does from Monday to Saturday at breakfast time from her fixed outdoor stall.  The dishes that are most in demand are: majadito de charque (dehydrated meat, rice, fried egg and fried plantain), locro (soup made of dehydrated meat, meat cut into small pieces, yuca, and egg), and Sopa de Remojado (bone soup), among other dishes.  She notes that this business provides her with the opportunity to provide the necessary medical attention for her baby.  The advantage of her business is that she sells her products daily, and the disadvantage is that she doesn't have enough capital to buy ingredients such as oil, rice, noodles, yuca, and meat, among others.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to see her newborn son healthy and strong.  She wants to expand her business by buying kitchen supplies such as oil, rice, eggs, meat, potatoes, and potato starch, among other things, to continue her business, since having younger children makes the business more difficult.  This is her second sequence of loans with this institution in the 2 years that she has been in business.  For these reasons, Ana is requesting a loan to buy ingredients to sell food and pay for the postnatal care of her newborn.

These objectives prompted Jackline to begin mixed farming. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last 10 years and has gained so much experience.

To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Kapsowar area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 50,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry and build poultry structures. Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved; she will be able to buy more poultry and her poultry will have a comfortable place to stay in. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level.

Her business is a convenience store and stationery shop. She is a good mother, independent, constant, active, attentive, responsible and very hardworking. She has her business in the \"Plan 3000\" area of town, which is known for the multiculturalism of its inhabitants, who are mostly Aymara, Quechua, and Guarani, and which is located in the southern part of the city. Immigrants took over the place and created a commercial area that is in constant growth. The city has a warm, subtropical climate with a temperature that varies from 21\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 Celcius [70\u00b0 to 95\u00b0 Fahrenheit] during the day.\r\n\r\nRebeca has a dark complexion, brown eyes, and long black hair that she ties up. She is short and robust. Her mother tongue is Guarani, which she uses with her family, and speaks Spanish due to common practice and because of her business. She sits at the center of the picture, wearing a black blouse with white flowers. She enjoys life accompanied by her partner, who works as a driver, and her son who still goes to school. They live in a rental room made of wood, and which has a tin roof. They have drinking water, electricity, and sewerage. Her wish to get ahead so she could generate a greater income for her family led her to form a group of people with businesses such as: motorcycle-taxi service, leather crafts, second-hand clothes sales, soda sales, manufacture of sheets, natural medicine sales, and breakfast services. By creating this group, they can request loans and improve their businesses.\r\n\r\nRebeca runs her convenience store and stationery shop from her own home, where she sells food and household essentials such as sodas, sugar bread, candy, etc. On the other side of her store she has a small stationery shop with items such as cardboards, pens, erasers, rulers, markers, paper, notebooks, etc. \" I started my business with only the convenience store, and due to requests from my customers I began to expand into a stationery shop,\" she says.

Today, this humble mother sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has about farming, commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Kallen enjoys poultry farming and dairy farming above all other activities. The main challenges she faces with this type of farming are disease outbreaks and expensive dairy feed. Kallen is asking for a loan to buy a quality breed of dairy goat. To her, raising goats is an enjoyable and lucrative farming experience. She understands the challenges that come with dairy goat farming and the market uncertainties. This knowledge has influenced her strategic plans to incorporate a few measures beforehand.

She lives with her partner in a neighborhood of the city of Barranquilla.  She is the mother of 3 adult children whose wellbeing she looked after.  There have been merchants of various products in her family, so she learned about being a salesman since she was a girl.  She decided to dedicate herself to this trade since she has 30 years of experience offering home goods such as fans, kitchen batteries, irons, and more to her acquaintances, friends, neighbors, and family members, as well as selling items through catalogs such as cologne, body cream, makeup, and personal care products.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, she needs an injection of capital for her business, since her customers have put in some orders for merchandise.  She is applying from her first loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation which she will use to buy various merchandise such as cosmetics, perfume, and beauty products.  Amira has been able to rise thanks to her determination and dedication, and also because of the trust that her suppliers have put in her who have allowed her credit or cash payments.

The house has running water, electricity and a sewage system.\r\nHis business is the production of party supplies, such as exclusive cards for social events, handmade invitations, pi\u00f1atas, candy dispensers, table decorations, party favors, decorative figures, gift boxes and other things.\r\n\"Party supplies and decorations are ideal for any themed party since they provide originality and detail. That is why we select and design all the ideas for the events.\" he says. The advantage of his business is that is runs continuously. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to grow and improve the business. His dream is to enlarge his shop. He wishes to buy a counter and an airbrush compressor to paint with. This is his first loan with this organization in the two years that he has been running his business. This is why Yerson is requesting a loan to buy furniture and machines for his party supplies business, in order to improve the services he provides.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1915094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy furniture and machines for his party supplies business, in order to improve the services he provides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-17T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-16T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yerson Leandro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-27T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":388.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":552.94},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":577.22},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":593.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":645.31},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T04:00:00Z","amount":664.4},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T04:00:00Z","amount":679.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":721.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":756.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T04:00:00Z","amount":777.49},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T04:00:00Z","amount":819.72},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":823.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.07},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.21},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.78},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.83},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.14},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.19},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.4},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karin Riechenberg","image":null}},{"id":912045,"name":"Sufyan's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sufyan is 24 years old, he is standing in the middle and raising his hand in the photo.

The group consist of five hardworking women who encourage each other to improve their businesses and their home situations. Since the formation of the group about a year and a half ago, the group members have shown their abilities in transforming their economic and social lives as they can now send their children to school, contribute to savings, and meet some of the household expenses, as well as putting food on the table for the family without waiting for the husband's income. \r\n\r\nRachel is in the business of cooking and selling sadza (staple food in Zimbabwe), buying and selling refreshments and snacks. She started her business three years ago and from the good reception she received from the market she serves, she has managed to gain more customers and increase her revenue. Her wish in the medium to long term is to buy a delivery van to start delivering breakfast and lunch in companies around Harare Central Business District. With a $400 loan, Rachel can save more towards the purchase of her first delivery van. She and her group have made two loan cycles with Thrive in which they repaid successfully.

Now her eldest son is a student, another sells ice-cream at the market, and her two youngest daughters are studying in secondary school. Her children always help their mother since they know with what difficulty she has raised them. Suratmo does not have a higher education, but earns a living by sewing. They have not been able to buy a refrigerator for a few years but in summer it is not possible to get by without one.
