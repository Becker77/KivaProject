Today, the farm has three cows and ten heads of poultry. The farmland is kept green and beautiful by the hundreds of trees planted on it. \r\n\r\nEsther is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to buy cereal grains.

She works in shoe repairs. She is a good mother who is  enterprising, independent, strong, tenacious, consistent, responsible, and very hard working. She works in \"Villa F\u00e1tima,\" a zone known to be the lung of the city. The climate is cold and dry, with a temperature that varies between 0-12 Celsius (32-54 Fahrenheit). \r\n \r\nRosa has a tanned complexion, with brownish-gray eyes, black braided hair, short stature, and a robust physique.

They live in their own house built with bricks and cement, along with a zinc sheet roof and a wooden floor. The house has access to electricity, but it does not have running water or a sewage system because she lives very far away from the city. \r\n\r\nRosa's business is a shoe repair shop. For work she changes the soles and heels, and does all types of shoe repairs. \"I started my business with my ex-husband. When I have a lot of work my children work with me,\" she says. The strength of her business is that she makes daily sales. The weakness is the lack of capital to buy a sewing machine and to repair her post, so that water does not seep in. \r\n\r\nHer dream is that her business improves, and that her children open their own repair posts. This is the first sequence of loan she has made with this institution during the 10 years that she has been working. For the above reasons, Rosa requests for a loan to purchase a sewing machine and to pay for the reparations of her post, so that she could help her children become independent.

She comments, \u201cI have a small workshop with an old machine that I started out with; the business is going well but sometimes the machine breaks down on me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe advantage of Melina\u2019s business is that she has regular customers; the disadvantage is the lack of a sewing machine that can handle the work she does. Her dream is to expand her workshop and stabilize it. She wishes to purchase an industrial sewing machine for working continuously without wasting time. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the five years that she has been developing this business. For these reasons, Melina is requesting a loan to buy an industrial sewing machine for continuous work to stabilize her tailor\u2019s workshop."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3895.85,"image":{"id":1919790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy

He has no plans to quit in the future, as he finds farming to be not only fulfilling, but also lucrative. However, his biggest challenges are the poor road network and lack of market. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Julius will construct a cow shed, which will later come in handy when he scales up and introduces zero-grazing. The long-term impact is an increase in productivity and improved animal health.

La ventaja de su negocio es que cuenta con ventas diarias, la desventaja es la falta de capital para estabilizar el negocio. Su sue\u00f1o es sacar a sus hijos profesionales. Ella desea realizar una inversi\u00f3n en su negocio mediante la compra de huevo por mayor para contar con mercader\u00eda constante y abaratar costos generando mejores ingresos. Esta es la 2 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 4 a\u00f1os que desarrolla esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Isabel solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de huevo por mayor para contar con mercader\u00eda constante y abaratar costos generando mejores ingresos.\n","en":"Isabel is 31 years old, and lives with her partner. She has three children, ages five, seven, and nine, and her business is selling eggs. She is a good mother, cheerful, optimistic, and happy. She has a good attitude, and she is committed to her work. She is generous, responsible, and very hardworking. \r\n\r\nShe carries out her business in the \u201cEl Torno\u201d locality, which is located about 32 kilometers southeast of the city. It is considered the citrus capital, having five thousand hectares (approximately 12,355 acres) devoted to citrus production. It has a warm, sub-tropical climate, with a temperature that varies during the day between 18 and 24 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nIsabel has olive skin, brown eyes, and long black hair that she wears tied back. She is short of stature, with a slim build. Her maternal tongue is Guaran\u00ed, and she speaks Spanish with the general public (she is in the center of the photo, wearing a sky-blue pullover).  She shares her life with her with her partner, who works in transportation, and with her children, who are studying in school. They live in a house that belongs to the family; it is built of wood, with a corrugated iron roof and a cement floor. It has well water that is extracted with a pump and electricity; it does not have sewer service.\r\n\r\nHer desire to succeed led her to lead a bank of persons with businesses such as a food sales stand, selling sweaters, construction-materials, knitted baby clothing, fried potatoes, sports clothing, and a neighborhood store, in order to request a loan and improve their businesses.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling eggs. She buys eggs at wholesale from the wholesale distributors, and also from local producers. She comments, \u201cThe egg varieties are white, creole, and quail; only the size changes, and therefore the price\u2026\u201d The advantage of her business is that her business has daily sales; the disadvantage is the lack of capital to stabilize the business.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to help her children to become professionals. She wants to make an investment in her business by purchasing wholesale eggs, in order to have a constant supply of merchandise and to lower costs, thus generating better earnings. This is the second loan cycle with the institution in the four years that she has been carrying out this activity.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons that Isabel is requesting a loan: for the purchase of wholesale eggs in order to have a constant supply of merchandise, and to lower costs, thus generating better earnings.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1918988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Pamellah's entrepreneurial spirit extends outside agriculture: She is involved in other personal businesses for extra income. Pamellah is very ambitious. She enjoys making more and more returns, but her lack of adequate capital puts her on a short leash. It is for this reason that she is turning to Kiva lenders for a loan. \r\n\r\nPamellah is seeking a loan of KES 42,400 to buy a cow. With more cows, she will be able to put the pasture on her farm to use and increase her milk production. Your loan will help Pamellah to pull herself out of poverty by constantly growing her asset base. The cow you will finance will reproduce, and with time Pamellah will produce many liters of milk and other dairy products.

She has to work hard and always stay strong through all of the adversities that may arise. Sibilina, a youthful 43-year-old mother, is a wise farmer who is respected by her neighbors and fellow farmers as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kapsowar, which is in the Rift valley region of Kenya. \r\n\r\nSibilina is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming. She grows maize and vegetables. Sibilina also operates a flour mill (posho mill), and she has dairy cows. Sibilina has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce to the market in a timely manner. This challenge has not made her give up and she states: \u201cI have to do something for my family\u201c. \r\n\r\nSibilina joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She applied for a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders, to buy a motorbike. Sibilina is from a remote village that has poor roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes), which require timely delivery to the market. \r\n\r\nThis loan will help Sibilina to achieve her dream and reach her goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Sibilina feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help women to gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan will be astronomical, because Sibilina will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering her produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume, because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. Her income will increase.

He is elegant and admirable in spirit and effort. He is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in his village because of his resilience. Despite personal challenges, his passion is to support his siblings and family. \r\n\r\nThe living conditions in the Kapsowar area are very tough, and you need to have a tough skin in order to survive. Felix has always shown the resilience necessary to beat all the odds. Because of the hardcore poverty in his village, Felix started practicing mixed farming 10 years ago. His sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg sales. However, these products are highly perishable and require timely delivery to the market. The Kapsowar area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads, which really hampers timely delivery of products to the market.  That is why Felix is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike, he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits, because the products will still be fresh. \r\n\r\nFelix is very determined to succeed. Because he is very disciplined with his finances, he believes he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and for his grandchildren through his accumulated profits. Felix's dream is to provide a secure future for his siblings by paying tuition fees for them. You will help him realize his dream through your loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":122.4,"image":{"id":1927714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Meet Margaret, 35 years of age, a very hard-working, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Mugwe, a remote village in Chuka. She is happily married and is blessed with three adorable children. \r\n\r\nShe has been practicing mixed farming for the last 20 years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Chuka area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high.

She is very industrious and resides in the Siongiroi area of Kenya. Jedidah has been farming for the past 10 years. Through these years, she has gained much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village.  She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops, and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Jedidah is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. <br \/><br \/>Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Siongiroi area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Jedidah could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. <br \/><br \/>Accessing funds has been a challenge for Jedidah, but she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Jedidah believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable a permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Jedidah to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going

She is a very industrious, honest and hard-working woman from the Nkubu area of Kenya, near the famous Mount Kenya. \r\n\r\nJacinta, 37, has been farming for the past eight years. Over the years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practising mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been different varieties of crops, milk, and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Jacinta is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. \r\n\r\nAlthough she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Nkubu area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Jacinta could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Jacinta, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Jacinta believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. \r\n\r\nShe also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Jacinta to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going

She is a smallholder farmer based in Kianjungu village, which is found in the Central region of Kenya. The 24-year-old farmer started in 2012 with a dairy cow and poultry for milk and eggs. As of today, she has also ventured into crop farming both for sale and consumption. \r\n\r\nShe sells her produce at Nkubu which is one of the fastest growing towns in Africa. Lenity is seeking a loan to increase her banana farming. Growing bananas does not require much effort, but to achieve high yields requires skills, dedication, and proper planting methods. \r\n\r\nLenity, who has three children, feels she is cut out for it. She has adequate space at the one acre farm she owns for this project.

For lack of work experience and education, it has been very difficult to find work opportunities and so she decided to venture into farming. \r\n\r\nShe is a 29-year-old smallholder farmer based in Kapsowar, which is a small rural town in the North Rift region of Kenya. Leah and her husband have been blessed with an adorable family. \r\n\r\nFor 10 years Leah has been a mixed-farmer. She keeps dairy cattle and poultry on her farm. She also grows maize, among other crops. Despite prevailing animal diseases, she finds dairy farming to be the most enjoyable commercial farming activity. Besides dairy farming, she has a deep connection with gardening. \r\n\r\nIn African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive, hobby for women. You really don't have to be born with a green thumb to give life to a glorious garden; any woman with a homestead and a few square feet of earth is doing her best to make her little corner of the world more gracious and beautiful. \r\n\r\nLeah, however, is taking this a little step further.

They live in a room, on family property, built of wood with tin roof and floor. The house has water, electricity and sewerage. The need to pay postnatal health care for her son was what inspired her to form a community bank. The members have a variety of businesses: selling fruit, leather craft, making hats, cattle, poultry, motorcycle taxi service, sale of second hand clothes and sale of natural medicine. They are applying for a loan to improve their businesses. <br \/><br \/>Her business is selling crafts such as necklaces, bracelets, earrings, rings, etc., \"our city is  frequented for trade and tourism, and people like to buy souvenirs of all kinds to remember their pleasant stay in this place ...\" she says. Alongside her craft activity, she sells typical fermented beverages, such as somo and chicha, both are a refreshing beverage made from corn, served cold, and are very popular. The advantage of her businesses is that she can do both at the same time; the challenge is the lack of working capital for the development of handicrafts and her beverages. Her dream is to improve her craft business with her own new designs. She wants to make the purchase of working material for handicrafts like leather, wood, clay, and others, and also for her business to buy soda, corn, sugar, ice, etc. This is the first sequence of loans with this institution in the 7 years she has had this business.<br \/><br \/>It is for these reasons that Andreyna is applying for a loan for the purchase of material for handicraft work as well for her beverage business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3050,"image":{"id":1918960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials to make traditional crafts as well as for her beverage business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-17T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-16T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":3050,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virgilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carla Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nahir","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andreyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-05T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-19T04:00:00Z","amount":1581.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T04:00:00Z","amount":1610.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T04:00:00Z","amount":1639.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T04:00:00Z","amount":1669.62},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T04:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T04:00:00Z","amount":1730.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T04:00:00Z","amount":1762.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T04:00:00Z","amount":1794.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T04:00:00Z","amount":1827.18},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T04:00:00Z","amount":1860.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T04:00:00Z","amount":1894.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T04:00:00Z","amount":1928.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.49},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.9},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":265.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":280.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":944.27,"local_amount":6501.5,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-18T12:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6515.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554915},{"amount":498.3,"local_amount":3430.93,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3438.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711469000},{"amount":516.6,"local_amount":3556.96,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3564.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296832},{"amount":1090.83,"local_amount":7510.61,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:24Z","rounded_local_amount":7526.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076981}],"funded_date":"2015-07-18T05:02:10Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":914648,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice is a 33-year-old mum who has given all her life for the benefit of her family, trying to raise them and together overcome all the adversities that have been presented to them in life.

Her tenacity and perseverance have enabled her to get ahead, overcoming various obstacles that have come her way. \r\n\r\nShe is a 33-year-old smallholder farmer from Kapsowar in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. Winnie owns a small parcel of land. On the farm, she practices mixed farming. This loving mother keeps dairy animals and grows maize and vegetables. She has 10 years of experience in farming. \r\n\r\nWinnie is seeking a loan to buy seeds and expand her horticulture farm. She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output. \r\n\r\nLoans for smallholder farmers with little irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Winnie. Through a group of 15 members called Kapyegon, Winnie has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. \r\n\r\nAccording to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Winnie because the institution believes that women too are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":246.85,"image":{"id":1928781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy seeds and start horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-17T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-16T20:40:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Winnie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.47},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.74},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.35},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.73},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.62},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.68},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.93},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.62},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":92.07,"local_amount":9207.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":9277.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023831},{"amount":154.78,"local_amount":15478.16,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":15596.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111954}],"funded_date":"2015-08-16T20:40:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tom D"}},{"id":916572,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la joven a quien se le ha pixeleado la cara por tener 29 a\u00f1os de edad y vivir en zona de alto riesgo, se dedica a la venta de productos de uso personal por medio de cat\u00e1logos de manera ambulante, tiene muchos clientes por los buenos precios, con lo que obtiene de sus ventas logra solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, la joven vive en casa propia con su compa\u00f1ero de vida, ella esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de perfumes, lociones, cremas, shampoo, desodorantes etc. todo por mayor y as\u00ed poder seguir con su trabajo para tener mejores ingresos.","en":"The young woman whose face is blurred in the photo (because she is 29 years old and lives in a high-risk area) lives in her own home with her life partner.

Meet Agnes, a young farmer from Githuu, a remote village in Nkubu, Kenya who has defied the common thinking about most Kenyans that agriculture is for the older generation. \r\n\r\nAgnes is happily married and together with her husband they are blessed with three children. Her primary source of income is milk and also she plants different varieties of food crops. She also engages in personal business and has been able to earn a handsome profit from the venture. Agnes practices agriculture with a difference, employing youthful energy, enthusiasm, and knowledge from the many agricultural training classes she has been attending to broaden her skills. \r\n\r\nAlthough she earns handsome profits from farming, she faces one big challenge and that is the high price of fertilizers, seedlings, and inputs, and this is a result of the monopoly that is enjoyed by the only agrovet shop in her area. She is requesting a loan to start an agrovet shop. \r\n\r\nGithuu area has only one agro dealer, which is catering to thousands of smallholder farmers who solely depend on that dealer for agricultural inputs. The agro dealer has been making a killing from farmers by charging them higher prices since this is the only agro dealer, making it a monopoly. Agnes wants to change this and seize the business opportunity, and through your loan she will start an agrovet shop and tap into the potential agricultural market. \r\n\r\nAgnes will also help the smallholder farmers in her area, who have long been having a serious problem accessing affordable farm inputs. Through your loan, Agnes will change from the peasant farmer she is right now to a certified agro dealer. \r\n\r\nThrough increased income from the loan, she will improve her living conditions, and her future plans are to purchase a truck which will be used to engage farmers in output marketing activities. Agnes believes that there is no doubt that youths like her can find rewarding employment in farming.

Its streets are completely paved with homes built on both sides of the two-way street on which travelers to the center of the country travel. The climate is warm and sub-tropical with a temperature that varies between 21 and 35 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nCarmen has olive skin, brown eyes, and short black hair.  She is short with a robust complexion and Guaran\u00ed is her native language, which is spoken locally, but she speaks Spanish culturally and in her business (seated to the left wearing a pink sweater).  She is married and works with her adult son.  They live together in their brick and cement home with the tin roof.  They use well water that they pump out, electricity, but no sewage.\r\n\r\nThe need to expand her business motivated her to head up a group of people with different businesses, such as fruit selling, welding, cell phone repair, salte\u00f1a sales, dishware sales, second hand clothing sales, and bedspreads, in order to request a loan to improve her business.\r\n\r\nShe sells traditional local food such as Cogote relleno (Creole chicken necks stuffed with potato), majao (ground salted meat, boiled bananas, and rice), peanut soup (peanut based soup), and other things.  \u201cMy customers are reliable, they come at the same time every day\u2026\u201d she says. The advantage in her business is that she has regular customers. The disadvantage is that she needs furnishings and kitchen utensils so she can sell food to a greater number of customers.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to open a restaurant and wants to expand her business by buying kitchen utensils such as flatware, dishes, pots etc.  Also some tables and chairs. This is her first loan sequence with the institution and she has been doing this for five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is why Carmen is asking for a loan to buy furnishing and kitchen utensils so she can serve more customers and improve her life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2801.02,"image":{"id":1918020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy furnishings and utensils.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-17T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-16T21:20:03Z","loan_amount":3425,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Giovanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Asunta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilibet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Javier Jacin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yessica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-31T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-15T04:00:00Z","amount":1742.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-29T04:00:00Z","amount":1804.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T04:00:00Z","amount":1837.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T04:00:00Z","amount":1870.97},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":1905.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T04:00:00Z","amount":1939.7},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T04:00:00Z","amount":1975},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T04:00:00Z","amount":2010.95},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T04:00:00Z","amount":2047.56},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T04:00:00Z","amount":2084.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T04:00:00Z","amount":2117.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T04:00:00Z","amount":2164.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.81},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":282.7},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.85},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":298.42},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":303.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":308.57},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1057.46,"local_amount":7255.6,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-18T12:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":7275.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554909},{"amount":560.35,"local_amount":3844.73,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3855.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468993},{"amount":580.94,"local_amount":3985.95,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3996.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296825},{"amount":602.27,"local_amount":4132.37,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4143.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076974}],"funded_date":"2015-07-23T13:25:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

During that time she has gained much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village, Her primary sources of income are milk, eggs, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. \r\n\r\nAnn is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. She is therefore seeking this loan to buy cereal. \r\n\r\nKenya's Chuka area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereal. This means that Ann could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there.

James, who is from the remote town of Nkubu, in Kenya, is an active and progressive farmer. He and his wife live on a small piece of land. \r\n\r\nJames has been practicing farming for the past six years. Having done farming for such a long time, he has gained so much experience that he is always ranked the best farmer in his village. \r\n\r\nKenyans drink a lot of milk. This tradition is probably derived from tribal culture - particularly the Meru tribe (James' tribe), where cows represent wealth. Demand for dairy milk has been high and James wants to take advantage of the market. \r\n\r\nTherefore, he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is another profitable agricultural venture in Kenya and James has already identified the breed of dairy cow that he wants. \r\n\r\nJames believes that to become a successful dairy farmer, one needs passion, information, and keenness to learn from the successful farmers. He has planted so many trees on his farm that food for the cattle will never be a problem. \r\n\r\nMarketing of the dairy milk and dairy products will not be a challenge either because he will sell the milk directly to the market and also to big dairy-processing firms. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, James will not only benefit from milk but also from the manure that will be used to improve the fertility of his farm, thus enabling him to save money that would have been spent buying fertilizers. \r\n\r\nJames has been facing challenges in accessing credit but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva are there to make his dream come true. James chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low. James underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and during the training season he learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro-finance institutions. \r\n\r\nThrough accumulated profits, James plans to permanently improve his living conditions and to secure the future of his school-aged children by paying tuition fees for them.

His fatherly love has been enough to show him that he needs to work hard to help his children get ahead with excellent values and an education. \r\n\r\nEdwin, 48, is a smallholder farmer in the Kitale area of Kenya. In the past five years, he has bred more than one dairy cow, poultry birds and has developed his farm. He has also planted and sold a variety of crops. He says the secret to his success is thinking of farming as a way to make money, not just as a traditional way of life \u2013 adopting new technologies and methods, crop diversification, record-keeping and good planning also help. \r\n\r\nEdwin was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that his family faced. However, he never gave up and he has been practicing farming. Because of how much he likes farming, he has even nicknamed one of his cows, which make him a very proud farmer, especially when he is milking his cows. Through his dairy cow, he is able to get between 5-10 liters a day, and this helps him support his family. \r\n\r\nEdwin also practices crop farming, but he has not been making good profits because of poor farming inputs, and that is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm inputs. Through the loan, he will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that he will use to greatly improve his crop production. \r\n\r\nModern farming requires the use of modern techniques; using high-quality seeds will assure him of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels.

is a 40-year-old woman with a great future ahead of her. She is a loving and caring mother who has been running a small-scale mixed farm in Kenya for 10 years. Her primary income sources are maize, vegetables, and profits from a small-time personal business. \r\n\r\nGrace is seeking a loan to purchase modern farming implements. She realized that she is working increasingly longer and harder on her farm. The work women in the area are currently doing on the farm was previously done by men. They have been forced to take over as their husbands migrate to find wage labour in urban areas.

Meet Rebecca. Rebecca is an industrious lady from the Kapsowar area of Kenya. She does farming on her family's small piece of land.

As of now, however, Rebecca is only interested in expanding her dairy business by becoming a milk vendor.

She will also have clean energy because biogas does not pollute the environment.\r\n\r\nThrough this loan, her children will have something to smile about, and that is a good education, which Lucy will now be able to afford because less money will be spent on fuel.\r\n\r\nKindly lenders, please assist Lucy in realizing her dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":132.46,"image":{"id":1930248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start a bio gas plant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-17T22:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-16T22:20:13Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.64},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":4772.55,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4865.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711507013},{"amount":45.47,"local_amount":4547.38,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4635.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023840},{"amount":39.26,"local_amount":3926.42,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4002.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111966}],"funded_date":"2015-07-18T12:27:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":916465,"name":"Everlyne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Everlyne is a hardworking dairy farmer from Mariashoni village.

There, nature transmits peace and even serves as inspiration for many of the visitors, because senses can be felt by the song of the birds or the fresh aroma of the fields. The group members consider themselves a family, and because of this they meet up to talk about the events and progress of their activities, always showing a positive and happy attitude to everyone else. The name was chosen, because for the members, charity is a quality that all human beings should have. They are: Alejandra \u2013 cosmetics and shoes; Cristina \u2013 raising pigs and lambs; Amalia - food; Karla \u2013 Raising pigs and sale of cosmetics; Luz \u2013 raising pigs and sale of footwear; Maria \u2013 Food and cosmetics; Susana - cosmetics; Edith \u2013 Clothing and Soft drinks; Mariana \u2013 Raising pigs; Amairani \u2013 shoes; Maria E. - shoes and clothing. Luz Maria or Luchi as she is called by her friends, is a woman, committed to fulfill her objectives. The fact of not having been able to continue with her education has not stopped her from achieving something in her work life, because for 5 years she has worked selling footwear by catalog. \"I remember as if it were yesterday when I had my first loan and I immediately ran to buy a packet of catalogs. From then on my job prospered\", she comments. Besides that, with part of the obtained earnings she developed a business of raising pigs. In average she must take care of 10 to 12 piglets per litter in different stages until she gets them to an average weight ranging from 60-70 kilos. In the same way, with the paid benefits, she was able to build two hog farms, a chicken coop, a fence and to remodel her house. This time, she has requested a loan to buy feed for fattening and whey; and she will also invest in her footwear business to buy more products.

Renny is the mother of three lovely children and she has been in the agriculture business for 15 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and maize. \r\n\r\nRenny has been relying on agriculture to make all her income. However, the rising costs of farming inputs (such as for fertilizers) and fluctuations in market prices are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. Despite these tough conditions, Renny remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. Renny is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of business least affected by harsh external conditions. Poultry farming is cheaper to run and the demand for chicken products is always high. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Renny will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profits. An increase in income for her will be timely since it will enable her to tackle high farm-related costs next season. This will greatly improve the quality of her work since the cost of every input will be adequately met. As a result, she will realize better-quality produce and more yields.

She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet the demand. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow; it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will produce between 8-12 litres of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying back the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. \r\n\r\nJanefer is very ambitious. In the near future, she intends to start adding value to her milk business by packaging the milk before selling, and she also plans to start selling dairy products.

Regina is happily married and together with her husband, blessed with five lovely children. \r\n\r\nFor the past 28 years, she has been involved in mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been growing different varieties of crops and keeping dairy cows. Regina has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family, \u201cshe said. \r\n\r\nRegina mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Regina is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge, hence she suffers so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetable and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price. \r\n\r\nThrough this loan, Regina is going to achieve her dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Regina feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Regina will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market and increase her income level. \r\n\r\nRegina is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work. With your loan, Regina will improve her living conditions and assure her children and grandchildren to come of a secure future.

They are requesting a loan to buy merchandise for their customers.  The members live in Buenos Aires which is the third largest canton of the province of Puntarenas, Costa Rica.  It is the fourth largest in extension in the country and includes nine districts.  There are not enough sources of employment, especially for women, so they decided to start their own business.\n\nOne of the members is Elizabeth who is 46, married and has three adult children who she raised thanks to her work.  She always has stood out as a hard worker.  She is a merchant and sells sandals, clothing, shoes and personal use items which people in the community request.  The community where she lives has a difficult access so there is nowhere to buy needed goods.  So she always runs out of inventory and customers are anxious for her to bring new merchandise as it is the only way they can acquire them.\n\nElizabeth is in need of a loan to buy the sandals, blouses, pants and lingerie to fill orders.

Christine is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. \r\n\r\nOf all the activities she involves herself in, dairy farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and milk her cows and feed them with fodder that has high nutrient value. Dairy farming being a very profitable business venture, Christine wants to take full advantage. She would like to expand her dairy business, but the biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital for growth. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan, which she will use to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. Christine has planted  grass, and feeding the cows will never be a challenge. She also owns an expansive piece of land, and the excess space will be productively used once she acquires the additional dairy cow. The cow she will buy will produce between 10 and 15 litres of milk per day, and this will translate to more income and profits. The profits from milk selling will allow Christine to grow her business further, by starting to package milk and by processing it into other dairy products, such as cream and yoghurt. In addition, she will benefit from the organic manure from the cow. \r\n\r\nShe projects that in the future she will be able to start a biogas plant at her farm, which will save her money in fuel costs.

Cada uno de ellos se dedica a una actividad econ\u00f3mica que permite satisfacer las necesidades de sus familias, los 12 integrantes actuales del grupo son: Severiana quien vende ropa, zapatos, perfumes, coronas, gu\u00edas, juguetes y accesorios; Guadalupe, carne; Rosa, art\u00edculos de plata; Miguel y Norma, ropa; Luis, refresco; Ernestina, bisuter\u00eda; Mar\u00eda y Concepci\u00f3n, antojitos t\u00edpicos; Nati, pescado; Leticia, abarrotes y Anah\u00ed quien maneja un centro nutricional.\n   Do\u00f1a Severiana es mejor conocida como do\u00f1a Seve por sus amistades y es madre de una ni\u00f1a de 8 a\u00f1os quien estudia la educaci\u00f3n primaria. Su peque\u00f1a siempre la llena de orgullo ya que cada ciclo escolar sobresale en el cuadro de honor debido a sus excelentes calificaciones. De igual forma tiene un hijo de 18  a\u00f1os quien adem\u00e1s de estudiar se dedica a la venta de ropa para caballero, por lo que su familia siempre ha sido el motor principal para afrontar los retos con fortaleza.\n   Gracias al pr\u00e9stamo otorgado por VisionFund M\u00e9xico pudo iniciar su negocio adem\u00e1s de invertir en la compra de floratel, papel celof\u00e1n, celo seda, alambre, hojas de color, cinta adhesiva  y cera para poder elaborar coronas y arreglos con motivo de los fieles difuntos y la celebraci\u00f3n de la  Virgen de Juquila y la Virgen de Guadalupe.

The smiling faces, for example, are important crafts that have been around since the Totonacas and Olmecas; the locomotive, \"the beautiful brown\", is one of the most famous for being among the first ones to cross the national territory; and the monument to the flag is an obligation for tourists. \r\n\r\nIn this city emerged a group called \"United We Shall Overcome\" (Unidos Vencermos) because for the group members \"union makes the force\". Each one of the members makes a living from an economic activity that allows him\/her to satisfy the family's necessities. The 12 group members are: Severiana who sells clothes, shoes, perfumes, wreaths, guides, toys, and accessories; Guadalupe, meat; Rosa, silver products; Miguel and Norma, clothes; Luis, sodas; Ernestina, imitation jewelry; Maria and Concepcion, typical snacks; Nati, fish; Leticia, groceries; and Anah\u00ed who manages a nutrition center. \r\n\r\nMrs. Severina is better known as Do\u00f1a Seve by her friends, and she's the mother of an 8-year-old girl who is currently in elementary school. Her little one always fills her up with joy because each school year she has made it to the honor roll due to her excellent grades. She also has an 18-year-old son who aside from studying, also makes a living selling gentleman's clothes. Her family has always been her principal engine to affront challenges with strength.\r\n\r\nThanks to the loan from VisionFund Mexico, she has been able to open her own business and also invest in the purchase of flowers, cellophane paper, silk zeal, wire, colored leaves, masking tape and wax to elaborate wreaths and arrangements for the deceased and the celebration of the Virgin of Juquila and the Virgin of Guadalupe. With the earnings she was able to establish a clothes store, and thanks to the perseverance and dedication to her activities, today she sells perfumes, toys and accessories. With the earnings she has been able to remodel her house and reinvest in her merchandise. \r\n\r\nThis time, she will invest the loan in purchasing t-shirts, blouses, shirts, pants, skirts, and dresses because her clients have requested clothes for graduation. \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in the courtyard of Do\u00f1a Seve, she's the one who wears a flowery blouse and brown pants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":1917230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase: t-shirts, blouses, shirts, pants, skirts, and dresses ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tierra Blanca, Ver","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-07-18T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-17T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":3425,"lender_count":114,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Severiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Guillermo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ernestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nati Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia Esmeralda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anahi Citlali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":54000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":6750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.13},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.13},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.12},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.12},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":428.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1712.5,"local_amount":27000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":27029.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768304},{"amount":856.25,"local_amount":13500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:37:09Z","rounded_local_amount":13514.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701355},{"amount":856.25,"local_amount":13500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:09Z","rounded_local_amount":13514.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204443}],"funded_date":"2015-07-18T16:44:40Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Luisa Islas","image":null}},{"id":916984,"name":"Benson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benson is a rural smallholder crop farmer from the Kitale area of Kenya.

Both study in the school in their neighborhood. For 15 years she has been selling natural medicine. She had to increase her work when she became widowed and now is the only support of the family. \"The need for an economic income to be able to offer the best for my children is my greatest motivation\", she commented with satisfaction. In the beginning she sold only in the streets on foot but thanks to the profits she got  she was able to buy a motorcycle which transports her product much quicker and safer to her clients. <br \/><br \/>She will invest the loan in buying capsules, vials, powders, chlorophyll and tea as they are the products that her clients use the most. The stability of her business is due to the good service she provides. She is always well informed about the needs of her clientele. \"To be able to sell medicine I took courses on each plant that is used in the medicine\", she stated. <br \/><br \/>Elideth's future plans are to sell in community that are difficult to access in such a way that her market will grow considerably and she also wants to buy an automobile that would facilitate her work.

They say the rural population is unevenly dispersed, and the farmers make low incomes, irregularly. Supported by Kiva, Juhudi Kilimo penetrates remote regions to finance agricultural assets and farm inputs to improve productivity and profitability of rural enterprises. \r\n\r\nGentrix is a 46-year-old smallholder farmer from Kitale in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. Gentrix owns a small parcel of land. On the farm, she practices mixed farming. This charming mother keeps dairy animals and grows maize and vegetables. She also has a side business sewing clothes. She has seven years of experience in farming. Gentrix is seeking a loan to buy seeds and expand her horticulture farm. She is very hard working and is determined to increase her farm's output. \r\n\r\nLoans for smallholder farmers with little irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Gentrix. Through a group of 15 members called Bethzatha, Gentrix has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi Kilimo, which use the group-based savings as collateral. According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to only stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Gentrix because the institution believes that women too are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":247.61,"image":{"id":1930529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seeds and expand her horticulture farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-18T12:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-17T12:00:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gentrix","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3892.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4006.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4123.35},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4243.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4367.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4495.53},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4626.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4762.13},{"due_date":"2016-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4901.31},{"due_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5044.55},{"due_date":"2016-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5191.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5343.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.72,"local_amount":9171.99,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:41Z","rounded_local_amount":9355.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711507018},{"amount":155.89,"local_amount":15589.06,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":15901.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111971}],"funded_date":"2015-07-18T20:55:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlotte Gonzalez","image":2018795}},{"id":916425,"name":"Monica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Monica is a smallholder farmer from the Rift Valley province of Kenya.

The Nkubu area is one of the regions that is populated and has a high demand for cereals. That means that Priscilla will make more profits and be able to satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Priscilla, but she feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Priscilla believes that this loan will be of much help and she will be able to satisfy the demand that is there for cereals. She believes that the extra income will allow permanent change to her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Priscilla to repay the loan, and secure the future of her school-going children. Lenders, if there is someone you should invest in, then it is Priscilla. Support this business owner, who wants to show that the role of a mother and a farmer isn't too much for her; she just needs your vote of confidence.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1930613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase cereals to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-18T12:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-17T12:20:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Priscilla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2016-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.64},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlotte Gonzalez","image":2018795}},{"id":917071,"name":"Robert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robert is 28 years old and he lives with his mother in Kobuleti.

Josephat is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. With the loan, Josephat will increase his income through selling eggs, poultry meat and also poultry feathers. The demand for poultry products in Kericho area is very high and through the loan he will be able to satisfy the demand.

Rose is blessed with six children, and she has been practicing mixed farming for the past nineteen years. On her farm she grows different varieties of crops and keeps a dairy cow and poultry. To meet her expenses and provide the best for her family, she also often engages in small personal business to make extra money. Farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction despite the low earnings. Rose said, \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" Her biggest challenge, however, is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. To a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. \r\n\r\nBecause of this challenge, Rose formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports small rural farmers. She acquired a dairy cow that she later named Lelmet meaning a cow with a white mark on the head, which produces milk daily that Rose sells to a co-operative. \"The money from milk comes regularly and is not really affected by sudden changes in the weather, if you have stored feed,\" said Rose. \r\n\r\nHer future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. The money Rose got from selling her milk was sufficient to repay her last loan. Today she is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy cow and is planning to become a fully-fledged dairy farmer. With this loan, Rose is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life with good health and a good livelihood.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":71.19,"image":{"id":1925257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-18T13:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-17T13:10:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1465},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1507.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1551.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1597.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1643.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1691.9},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1741.41},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1792.3},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1844.68},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1898.59},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1954.08},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2011.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.22,"local_amount":3240.45,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3537.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506927},{"amount":35.97,"local_amount":3309.28,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3612.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111876}],"funded_date":"2015-07-18T16:58:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":917090,"name":"James","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dairy farming has always played a core role in East Africa.

He has different ways to make money including a small personal business (motorbike business), but kept coming up short. He decided the best way to grow economically was to improve his farm's productivity. To increase milk production, he could either buy more cows or replace the existing cows with more productive breeds. The latter made more economic sense. Traditional breeds are well-adjusted to the environmental conditions and disease resistance, but their milk production is very low. Cross-breeds and Friesians are more productive, and can survive in the same environment as the traditional breeds, but they come at a price. James is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to purchase a productive dairy cow that will bring him more income.

She decided to study this profession because ever since she was little she has liked managing her things and her pocket money.  She now sees that this career is very important.  She feels that she will benefit in such a way that she will be able to engage in the world of business, making decisions, and having opportunities.  It is not just this.  She will also help her family financially.\r\n\r\nShe has been studying Industrial Administration for a year and a half.  She is half way through her degree studies.  She still needs a year and a half to be able to finish her degree.  \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle that occurred is that her mother got sick, and her father does not have steady work.  Therefore, she does not have enough money to be able to pay for her studies.  This is putting the continuity of her degree studies at risk.\r\n\r\nThat is why she turns to Kiva so that they are able to provide the necessary support.  This way her dreams of being a great businesswoman will not be cut short.\r\n\r\nWhen she completes her degree she plans on working in different areas of her field such as storage and finances.  Above all, she plans to enter into the area of production.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to be able to pay the debt that she has, which prevented her from continuing her education and that her parents will not have to worry about.  This will let her mother recuperate completely from her illness because she will not have to do the jobs that impair her health.\r\n\r\nThe loan will also help her to fulfill one of her dreams and objectives, which is the satisfaction of being able to work and continue studying in other universities.  She feels very good because she sees that there are good people who help people who need it or are going through this situation.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to work for a big business as an Industrial Engineer, thanks to the validation of her university studies.\r\n\r\nFlor wishes to say some words to Kiva.  \u201cI feel very motivated to continue studying.  Keep helping because there are a lot of young people like me who need this support.  I am a responsible and punctual person.  Approve me, and I promise to study and not disappoint you.  Many thanks for your support.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":199.9,"image":{"id":1921329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay her current debt, to continue studying Industrial Administration, and to come to work at a great, renown business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":358,"posted_date":"2015-07-18T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-17T15:20:04Z","loan_amount":3425,"lender_count":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor Nataly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3425,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":3425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3425}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.16,"local_amount":66.16,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":66.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696582565},{"amount":66.63,"local_amount":66.63,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":66.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711500461},{"amount":0.21,"local_amount":0.21,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:09:03Z","rounded_local_amount":0.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731018275},{"amount":66.9,"local_amount":66.9,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-01T13:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":66.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752106606}],"funded_date":"2015-07-18T18:42:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":917162,"name":"Semu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Semu is a 39-year-old married man with six children, all attending school in Kasese, Uganda. \r\n\r\nHe owns a retail shop of general merchandise and is also a coffee buyer and seller.

Although it will be another year and a half before she finishes her degree, she is currently studying in the first year.

Therefore, her main obstacle is money.  \r\n\r\nThis is why she is returning to Kiva for support in the form of an educational loan.  This way, she does not have to put aside her greatest dream, which is to have a large and consolidated textile company that exports to the world.

She has gained so much experience through those years of farming. Sara practices mixed farming. That is, she grows maize and keeps dairy cows, and through these activities she has been able to earn a decent and honest income. Because of the passion she has for farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows. She really enjoys taking care of her cows. \r\n\r\nAlthough Sara has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious mum. Her farm has not been producing as much of a harvest because of the lack of fertilizer and good seeds and the presence of pests and diseases. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy farm implements and buy seeds so as to expand her horticulture farm. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Sara will be assured of a bumper harvest, and this will translate into more profits and cash. Through the use of good seeds and fertilizer, she will increase her profit margins. Through this loan, Sara will be able to expand her horticulture business. \r\n\r\nShe sees a lot of room for improvement and growth. What is lacking is the capital to drive the positive change. With your loan, Sara will make enough income to take care of her family and other farming expenses. \r\n\r\nShe wakes up early and goes to sleep very late every day to give her family a decent living and afford her children proper education.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":135.12,"image":{"id":1931570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farm implements and expand his horticulture business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-18T19:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-17T19:00:05Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4300.81},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4426.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4555.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4689.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4826.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4967.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":5112.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5261.66},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5415.43},{"due_date":"2016-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5573.7},{"due_date":"2016-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5736.59},{"due_date":"2016-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5904.24},{"due_date":"2016-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6076.79},{"due_date":"2016-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6254.38},{"due_date":"2016-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6437.17},{"due_date":"2016-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":6625.3},{"due_date":"2016-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":6818.92},{"due_date":"2017-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":7018.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.89},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.12},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.62},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.74},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.37},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.04},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.54},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.25},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.19},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.97,"local_amount":4697.17,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4796.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711507047},{"amount":40.73,"local_amount":4073.41,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4159.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023867},{"amount":47.42,"local_amount":4741.56,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4841.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111996}],"funded_date":"2015-08-17T16:25:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":913706,"name":"Rael","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rael is a passionate and hardworking smallholder farmer from the Nandi Hills area of Kenya.

This will give her the flexibility to explore the different opportunities that she has.\r\n\r\nAlso, the motorcycle will give her an alternative source of income if she decides to offer transportation services to other members of her community. Income generated from this investment will enable Rael to grow her business and meet the basic needs and wants of her family.

printing business. Though she's already 55 years of age, she remains striving to help and supply the needs of her family. Since 2004, she has been offering customers her print service and starting from just a small one, her business now grew, catering larger services for people. \r\n\r\nNow, to support and continually improve her inventory, she would like to request a loan that she will use in buying more paper products for printing and other materials needed in beautifying her shop. She simply would like to avail an amount of PHP 15,000 for this. She promises to use this amount wisely. \r\n\r\nIn the future, if her business expands, she dreams of helping also other aspiring entrepreneurs.

This taught her not to believe in lack and to work harder than the people in her surrounding.

Her main income sources are is milk, meat, eggs, and tea, which all come from her 4 acre farm.\r\n \r\nThe biggest challenge and growth constraint that Dorcas is facing right now is lack of capital to secure more land for farming.

There, she keeps 2 dairy cows, 10 heads of poultry, and plant vegetables. The problem is that the land is too small, and this she finds to be very limiting. She is seeking a loan to secure more land and increase her productivity. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Evalyne hopes to have more land to cultivate and produce more food that will give her family decent diets and better income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":178.03,"image":{"id":1925365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy land and thus increase her dairy and produce farm ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-18T19:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-17T19:10:08Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evalyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3870.73},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3983.85},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4100.28},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4220.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4343.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4470.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4601.03},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4735.49},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.89},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5016.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.93},{"due_date":"2016-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5313.82},{"due_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5469.11},{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5628.95},{"due_date":"2016-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5793.45},{"due_date":"2016-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5962.77},{"due_date":"2016-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6137.06},{"due_date":"2016-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6316.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.71},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.7},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.01},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.36},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.74},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.63},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.14},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.29},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.94},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.63},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.37},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.04,"local_amount":9104.36,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":9143.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711506932},{"amount":43.82,"local_amount":4382.25,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4401.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023784},{"amount":43.17,"local_amount":4316.67,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4335.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752111880}],"funded_date":"2015-08-14T15:49:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":913980,"name":"Getrude","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Getrude is a person who has had to overcome a lot of adversity in her life.

This area has harsh weather conditions and to survive, you must have tough skin, but Getrude has defied all the odds and has been engaged in farming for the past forty one years. \r\n\r\nHer primary sources of income are crops and animal farming. She also gets some income through personal business. Getrude is contented with the farming way of life. Getrude is a very enterprising woman, and although she never had formal education or formal employment, she has always worked hard on her farm and she has always assured her children and family of a decent meal. \r\n\r\nThe Kitale area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why she is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business. Being an elderly woman and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Getrude feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising women like her. \r\n\r\nGetrude is well disciplined with finances and she plans that through the accumulated profits, she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children who are in college.
