Thomas resides in the Chebiemit, Kapsowar area of Kenya where poverty is seen in every homestead yet every day when you look at the people living in the area you can see bright people who are eagerly yearning for a golden chance to get out of the poverty conditions that they are in. Armed with this conviction, Thomas has kept hope and has been toiling on his farm for the past 10 years. \r\n\r\nHis primary sources of income have been milk, crops and some \u201cside hustles\u201d he does to supplement the meager income he earns from farming. The Chebiemit area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a sea of people but the mill keeps breaking down; hence farmers are not able to grind their maize. Thomas intends to change this and is requesting a loan to buy an electric posho mill, which will grind corn or maize into flour. \r\n\r\nMaize meal is very common in Kenya and is a staple food for many communities. Many Kenyan families consume the maize product \u201cUgali\u201c(hard porridge) regularly. The market usually provides sifted flour, but the cost is higher because of the sifting and packaging. Cheaper flour can be obtained by milling the maize directly using a posho mill. \r\n\r\nThrough this loan, Thomas will be able to grind maize faster because he will use an electric posho mill. Cases of breakdown will be long history because electric posho mills are more reliable. This loan will assist Thomas to permanently change his life and achieve his life mission of driving economic development and poverty alleviation in communities in arid and semi-arid areas. Profits from the posho mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan, which Thomas promises to fully repay on time. \r\n\r\nIn the next two years, Thomas sees himself as a very established businessman who will be running more than one posho mill in his remote village. Thomas patiently waits for your kindness.\r\nSupport this loan to a farmer from the Kenya\u2019s remote area who has great dreams for his family!\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1932542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy an electric posho mill to grind cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-18T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-17T20:30:04Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":7029.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":7234.89},{"due_date":"2015-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":7446.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":7663.94},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":7887.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":8118.45},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8355.71},{"due_date":"2016-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8599.91},{"due_date":"2016-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8851.24},{"due_date":"2016-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9109.92},{"due_date":"2016-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9376.15},{"due_date":"2016-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9650.17},{"due_date":"2016-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9932.2},{"due_date":"2016-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":10222.47},{"due_date":"2016-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":10521.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.35},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.88},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.18},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.56},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.51},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.1},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.76},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.5},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.32},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.23},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":917583,"name":"Karine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Karine is 58 years old and she lives in Gugark village of Lori region.

Meet Teresia, a mother from Siongiroi, a remote town in the Rift Valley province of Kenya. She has spent the past five years of her life farming. She sells milk, poultry, and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in personal business to make ends meet. Teresia is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. \r\n\r\nOf all the activities she involves herself in, dairy farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and milk her cows and feed them with fodder that has high nutrient value. She is so keen and close with her cows. Milking her cow makes Teresia very proud, and she feels fulfilled. Dairy farming being a very profitable business venture, Teresia wants to take full advantage. She would like to expand her dairy business, but the biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital to grow with. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan which she will use to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. Teresia has planted Napier grass, so feeding the cows will never be a challenge. She also owns an expansive piece of land, and the excess space will be productively used once she acquires the additional dairy cow. The 'exotic' cow she will buy will produce between 10 and 15 litres of milk per day, and this will translate to more income and profits. The profits from milk selling will allow Teresia to grow her business further, by starting to package milk and by processing it into other dairy products, such as cream and yoghurt. In addition, she will benefit from the organic manure from the cow. She projects that she will be able to start a biogas plant at her farm, which will save her money in fuel costs. With your loan, all that Teresia dreams of is a secure future for her children. Teresia awaits your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":148.97,"image":{"id":1931468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-19T09:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-18T09:40:03Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3785.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3895.71},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4009.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4126.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4247.34},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4371.47},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4499.23},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4630.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4766.05},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4905.34},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5048.7},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5196.25},{"due_date":"2016-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5348.12},{"due_date":"2016-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5504.41},{"due_date":"2016-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5665.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.47},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.31},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.66},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.05},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.49},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.96},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.48},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.04},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62,"local_amount":6200,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6331.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711507043},{"amount":86.97,"local_amount":8696.71,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":8880.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023861}],"funded_date":"2015-07-19T19:11:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":917499,"name":"Magret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magret is a Rwitsuru resident, Nyakahita, Kiruhura district, her major source of income is agricultural where she has concentrated in cow fattening.

she is a mother of two children. She struggles for a living by growing cassava which is her main source of income. Meanwhile, she also grows paddy rice to supplement her family\u2019s income. She has been in this job for 43 years already. \r\n\r\nAs the pest has destroyed her outputs, An found that it is hard to sell her crop products at good price in the market. An really wants to save her endangered business and expand it, but she lacks capital.

Meet Agapio, one of the most hardworking men on earth. He is 56 years of age, very hardworking and a go-getter. He is the proud father of four lovely children. He hails from Kanyakine, a remote village in the Nkubu area of Kenya. This area has harsh weather conditions, and to survive you must have tough skin, but Agapio has defied all the odds and has been engaged in farming for the past 34 years. \r\n\r\nHis primary sources of income are poultry, milk and animal farming. Agapio passionately loves farming and has even nicknamed one of his cows. Whenever he is milking his cow, he feels proud. He is content with the farming way of life. His biggest challenge in farming is irrigating his farm. \r\nHe is requesting a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes that he will use to pump water from the river to his farm. Irrigation is used to assist in growing agricultural crops, maintaining landscapes, and re-vegetating disturbed soils in dry areas as well as during periods of inadequate rainfall. \r\n\r\nThrough this loan, he will be able to double his crop production, and this will translate to more income. Through the extra income from farming, he will be able to support his family and keep up with his rising family expenses. Agapio patiently waits for your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":78.74,"image":{"id":1932662,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

However, despite these challenges, Johana loves farming. \r\n\r\nJohana practices mixed farming, and through that he has been able to take care of his aging parents. Not everything has been good for this humble and hard-working man. The Kitale area has a ready market for poultry products and eggs, and Johana, being an enterprising person, would want to take advantage of that and make profits. \r\n\r\nThat is why he is kindly seeking a loan to start poultry farming. Johana has got enough space on his farm and wants to make use of the space through poultry farming. Other than income from selling eggs and poultry products, poultry will also provide manure to use in his farm, hence the money that could have been used in buying it will be saved.

Only the last daughter lives with her, and is in sixth grade. Paula grew up with her parents and couldn't got to school because, at that time, her country suffered from a civil war and due to fear that she would be kidnapped by one of the groups, they did not send her to school. Since then, she worked with her parents in agriculture, growing corn and beans.\r\n\r\nPaula, from when she was little, grew up planting basic grains and since she got married, she grows vegetables in small amounts such as green beans, cucumber, chilies, and tomatoes. She learned to plant vegetables thanks to an organization who trained them and this was how she undertook this work. She also has a small pond with fish she sells in the community and they help her feed her family. \r\n\r\nPaula makes bread to sell and raises and fattens chickens, and in this way she works to help her children and her husband with the household income. When she goes to sell her vegetables in the city, her husband stays to take care of and feed the fish and chickens and keep an eye on the irrigation for the vegetables since he has to go put the hoses in the river near where they get water. She goes in the morning to sell vegetables three times a week, she brings the vegetables in a basket and in the afternoon she cares for the fattening chickens. \r\n\r\nPaula asks for the loan to purchase 150 chicks to fatten, purchase concentrated feed, vitamins and minerals. All this is necessary so they fatten and to continue working with selling fattened chickens. Previously, her business was a bit stagnant because she had losses due to nearly all of her chickens dying. Also, she will invest part of the money to purchase fertilizer for the cucumber crop she currently has. \r\n\r\nPaula dreams of continuing to work with the different crops and raising small animals to continue improving her quality of life little by little. In addition, she wants to improve her house and plans to make a chicken coop with better conditions for her fattening chickens because the one she has now is the traditional kind."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":117.91,"image":{"id":1921705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase 150 chicks to fatten, to purchase concentrated feed, vitamins and minerals.

The living conditions in the Kitale area are very tough and you need to have tough skin in order to survive. Edwin has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. \r\n\r\nBecause of the hardcore poverty in his village, Edwin started practicing mixed farming and has been doing it for the past 10 years. Edwin's sources of income are a small side hustle business(motorbike business),vegetables, milk, and egg selling; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, and one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. \r\n\r\nThe Kitale area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Edwin is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. \r\n\r\nEdwin is very determined to succeed and because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans that through accumulated profits he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and also for his family. Edwin's dream is to provide a secure future for his children through paying tuition fees for them.

Her daughter, Barnali, is 17 years old and reads in grade 12 at Falakata Girls' High School.\r\n\r\nBishakha looks after her children at home and does the household chores daily. Her husband is a farmer by profession. The small income he derives from cultivation work hardly meets their household requirements. It is difficult to manage the annual tuition fees of his children for each new session for a low-income family. Her daughter, Barnali, got an average mark in the grade 11 exam. She has a dream to be a teacher in future, so she wants to join coaching classes.

She struggles for a living via growing cassava to earn the main source of income to support her family. To supplement her income, she sells some snacks in her community. She has been involved in her business for ages. Now, her cash crop grows slowly and she gets lower-than-expected outputs. \r\n\r\nThis is her second time with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) and now she is applying for a loan of 2,000,000 KHR for each member. She wisely used her past loan to improve her living standard. For this second loan, Sokhim, the leader of a group of four members, will use her loan to buy organic herbicide to kill weeds in her farmland so that the crop can grow better and produce good outputs. She hopes to give great care to her cassava farm so that it can produce good outputs and earn a good income to support her family\u2019s living."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":164.92,"image":{"id":1933156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy organic herbicide to kill weeds in her farmland so that the crop can grow better and produce good outputs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kratie Province, Snoul District","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2015-07-19T16:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-18T16:40:09Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sokhim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dep","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kunthea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chantha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":8000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":167000},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":167000},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167000},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167000},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":167000},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":167000},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":167000},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":167000},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167000},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":167000},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":167000},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6163000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.22},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.22},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1521.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":82.46,"local_amount":334000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":336007.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711691628},{"amount":41.23,"local_amount":167000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:54:05Z","rounded_local_amount":168003.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731194674},{"amount":41.23,"local_amount":167000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":168003.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752282203}],"funded_date":"2015-08-17T20:05:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Lennon","image":1707241}}]}
