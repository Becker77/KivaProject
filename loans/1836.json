As she is able to earn about 36,100 KHR per day to support her family, she cannot afford to save her business better.

He has an eight-year-old daughter and his business is selling broaster chickens. He is a good father, enterprising, committed to his work, dedicated, steadfast, responsible and a very hard worker. \r\n\r\nHis business is located in the 'Pacajes' zone, which is midway on the route to Viacha on the central altiplano, southwest of the city. The climate is cold and dry and the temperature ranges from 0 - 12 degrees centigrade (32 - 54 F) during the daytime.

They live in a house that is owned by the family and is built of adobe, brick and cement with a metal roof and cement floor. It has potable water, electricity, gas, and plumbing. \r\n\r\nHe sells broaster chickens; he buys chicken every day, prepares it, fries it in oil, and serves it on a platter with french fries, rice and salsa. He does this every day of the week. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy a broasting machine to replace the one he has which is broken. His dream is to expand his business. He wants to buy a new frying machine to replace the one he has so he can keep his business running. This is his first loan sequence with the institution in the two years he has had his business. \r\n\r\nThese are the reasons why Edwin is asking for a loan - to buy a frying machine to replace the one he has and keep his broaster chicken business running."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":242.3,"image":{"id":1924320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a new chicken fyer to replace his old one.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-19T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-18T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin Franz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-09T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":390.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":407.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":425.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":437.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":475.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T04:00:00Z","amount":489.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T04:00:00Z","amount":501.18},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":532.03},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":557.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T04:00:00Z","amount":573.32},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T04:00:00Z","amount":604.44},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":603.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.07},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.45},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.09},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.59},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.37},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.61},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.15},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":799.18,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":804.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711469010},{"amount":61.99,"local_amount":425.08,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":427.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296842},{"amount":63.76,"local_amount":437.26,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:29Z","rounded_local_amount":439.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076990}],"funded_date":"2015-08-18T14:26:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":917937,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna is a married woman with six children.

He is single and lives with his beautiful family of six children between the ages of 10 and 19 in a community called San Miguelito. As Miguel is a man who loves to be with nature, a while ago he started to grow and sell coffee. Thanks to this work he has gotten his family ahead in life.

The previous loan has helped her to have enough household supplies for her family\u2019s uses and she can keep her children in school and improve her family\u2019s living. \r\n\r\nAs the group leader of four members, she will ask for new loan of 200,000KHR in order to renovate her old house for more comfortable living. She hopes her family will be able to have a better house to stay in than before.

Her business is located in the El Torno area, characterized by collecting and selling agricultural products such as fruit, vegetables, meat, etc., where the wholesale distributors come and purchase by the truckload the fruit and vegetables which they later sell through the whole city. It has a sub-tropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade.  \r\n\r\nNatividad has dark skin, dark eyes, long black hair that she keeps tied up in a ponytail, is short, of a medium physique, her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks locally and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for the business that she does (she is seated). She shares her life with her partner who works in construction, and with her children who go to school. They live in a house that the family owns, built of wood with a roof of metal sheeting and a cement floor which has well water drawn by a pump and electricity, but which doesn't have sewer service. Due to the need to expand her business, at this time she is leading a business loan group. The businesses are a motorcycle taxi service, selling seeds and manure, an autobody shop, second-hand clothing sales, selling natural medicines, selling food, and selling vegetables. They joined together to ask for a loan to improve their businesses. Her business is sewing. She works altering all sorts of clothing such as boot-bottom length, the width of the waist, fixing tears, making modifications, etc. \"Here, where we live, the clothing gets ruined quickly so my customers are continual and I also make pants and other clothing...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she has regular customers. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy an industrial sewing machine. Her dream is that her children become professionals. She wants to purchase an industrial sewing machine to open a sewing shop and make pants to sell in bulk. This is her third loan cycle with the institution in the 10 years she has been doing this work. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Natividad asks for a loan to purchase an industrial sewing machine to open a sewing shop and make pants to sell in bulk.

Her occupation is selling meals. Diana is a good mother, enterprising, dedicated, optimistic, patient, responsible and very hard working. \r\n\r\nHer business is located in 'El Torno' which is 32 kilometers to the southwest and is a medium sized city. Its streets are completely paved and several residential buildings rise from both sides of the modern two-lane road which is used by travelers on their way to the interior of the country. It has a warm, sub-tropical climate and temperatures range during the day from 21 to 35 degrees centigrade (70 to 95 F). Diana has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair tied in a pony-tail, and she is short and stocky in stature. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed  which she speaks at home, but she uses Spanish in general and for her business. (She is seated on the right, wearing orange shoes and a white shirt.) \r\n\r\nHer parents work and she lives at their house which is owned by the family. It is built of wood and has a metal roof and cement floor. It has pumped well water and electricity, but no plumbing. \r\n\r\nThe need to pay for postnatal expenses for her newborn baby inspired her to establish a bank of people with businesses so they could apply for a loan and earn more income.  Their businesses include: catalog cosmetics sales; motorcycle taxi service; locksmith shop; milk sales; empanada sales; soft drink sales; and second-hand clothing sales. Diana sells traditional foods and she makes: majadito (dehydrated meat, rice, fried egg and fried plantain), locro (soup made of dehydrated meat, chopped meat, yucca and egg), peanut soup, rice with cheese, and others. Her daily routine consists of preparing one dish per day to take out on her two-wheeled cart to sell on the street. \"My baby's needs inspired me to become independent, especially because I need to take care of him all the time and work too...\" she comments. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her job is that she can work and take care of her child; but the disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy kitchen supplies such as rice, potatoes, yuca, noodles, meats, oil, etc. Her dream is to give her baby a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe wants to buy kitchen supplies so that she will always have what she needs on hand. This is her first loan sequence with the institution in the three years that she has been doing this work. These are the reasons why Diana is asking for a loan - to buy kitchen supplies so she will have her work materials readily available, and pay for the baby's postnatal expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":1924472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy kitchen supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-19T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-18T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":3500,"lender_count":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Jimena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlos Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yulisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marco Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yamile","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-09T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-23T04:00:00Z","amount":1807.62},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T04:00:00Z","amount":1840.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T04:00:00Z","amount":1874.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T04:00:00Z","amount":1908.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T04:00:00Z","amount":1942.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T04:00:00Z","amount":1978.21},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T04:00:00Z","amount":2014.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T04:00:00Z","amount":2050.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T04:00:00Z","amount":2088.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T04:00:00Z","amount":2126.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":2164.9},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T04:00:00Z","amount":2204.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.41},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":273.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":288.49},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":304.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":310.07},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":321.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":805.31,"local_amount":5522.15,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-18T12:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5556.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554923},{"amount":561.6,"local_amount":3850.96,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3874.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711469012},{"amount":881.32,"local_amount":6043.31,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:16:56Z","rounded_local_amount":6080.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296844},{"amount":1251.77,"local_amount":8583.58,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":8636.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076992}],"funded_date":"2015-07-21T14:26:46Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":917503,"name":"Maxine Renee","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maxine Rennee, a hardworking woman with two children, earns a living by pig fattening in the Philippines.

","en":"Pedro was born in a place called Apantillo El Sabalar in the year 1985.  When he was very young he learned to work in agriculture growing basic grains and how to work with livestock with his father.\r\n\r\nPedro is married and has two children, a five year old son and a three year old daughter.  His oldest child is starting elementary school.   Pedro says that he will support his children a lot so that they go to school because he did not have this opportunity.\r\n\r\nWhen Pedro was 22 he father gave him an inheritance of some land for him to work.  He frequently remembers what his father said about this land.  He told him that is is for planting, and to make the land produce and support his family.  And this is what Pedro has been doing.  He has been growing basic grains and raising livestock.\r\n\r\nHe is also planning to plant pasture in order to increase the number of animals he has.  He feels that the livestock have given him good earnings.  He has been able to support his family, and with a lot of effort he was able to build his humble house.  He is planning on setting up a grocery store in his house in order to help a little more.\r\n\r\nPedro says that he has been blessed because he has a close knit family.\r\n\r\nThere is no electricity in the community where Pedro lives.  That is why he is requesting a loan to buy a solar system, which will be installed at his house.  It will be a great help to his family and his work.  Pedro would be very grateful if he is given the opportunity of this loan to buy a solar system.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1921469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy a solar system.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":279,"posted_date":"2015-07-19T22:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-18T22:20:05Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":279.51,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":127.05},{"due_date":"2017-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":152.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.36},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-07-20T08:02:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":918182,"name":"Hadiyat\u2019S Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hadiyat and his group members are farmers by occupation.

It has a hot, tropical climate with a daytime temperature that varies between 21 and 35 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nMaria has a dark complexion, brown eyes, and long brown hair that she wears in a ponytail.  She is short and has a medium build.  Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks at her place.  She speaks Spanish with the general public and for the business she conducts.  (She is seated to the left, and she is wearing a green shirt and pink pants.)\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her life partner, who works as a driver, and with her children.  The oldest works, and the younger ones go to school.  She lives in the family home, which is built from wood, brick, and cement.  It has a corrugated tin roof and a cement and dirt floor.  They have running water, electricity, and indoor plumbing.\r\n\r\nHer desire to improve led her to establish a bank of people with businesses like selling second-hand clothes, selling second-hand shoes, selling natural medicine, leather handicrafts, making woven goods, selling eggs, and selling cookies.

Above all, she demonstrates a positive attitude, and she stands out because her happiness is contagious.  For ten years, she has worked selling beauty products through a catalog.  Helping her two children go to school for a professional degree considerably motivated her business\u2019s success.  At the start, her primary customers were her friends and family members.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she works in a pharmacy each morning, since her entrepreneur spirit cannot rest.  She comments, \u201cI\u2019ve never really liked being at home doing nothing.  Besides, I need money to keep meeting my household expenses.\u201d  She also has support from her daughter if a time should come when she is unable to attend to the cosmetics business.  This time, she is requesting a loan to buy beauty products such as creams, perfumes, lipstick, make-up, etc.\r\n\r\nBertha is very happy and grateful for the previous loans from VisionFund, since thanks to that support, she grew her business and was able to pay for her children\u2019s studies, who graduate as a teacher and a lawyer.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Zuhey, who will buy in lambs and rabbits; Felipa, who will buy groceries; Maria Luisa, who will buy desserts; Lilia, who will buy underwear; Magdalena, who will buy beauty products; and Juana, who will buy jewelry.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken in Lilia\u2019s house.  Bertha is the one with short hair, wearing a pink blouse.  There is an extra person in the photo that also belonged to the group, but who did not receive a loan in the end."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6000,"image":{"id":1917830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy beauty products such as creams, perfumes, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Oro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-07-20T02:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-19T02:20:03Z","loan_amount":6000,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zujey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":94000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":11750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2250,"local_amount":35250,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":35360.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696768307},{"amount":1500,"local_amount":23500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":23573.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701359},{"amount":1500,"local_amount":23500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":23573.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204447},{"amount":750,"local_amount":11750,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":11786.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291869}],"funded_date":"2015-07-20T05:00:42Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christy Sobolik","image":null}},{"id":917981,"name":"Maricar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maricar is 40 years old and married with three children.

He's enterprising, independent, persevering, strong, responsible, and very hardworking.  His business is selling livestock.  He works in the thousand-year-old community of Suriqui Island, known for its shipyard of rafts made of totora reed, a local aquatic rush used to make the boats by hand with techniques inherited from the pre-Inca period--boats that are capable of crossing the Atlantic.  The climate is cold and dry, and the temperature ranges from zero to 12 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n\r\nVicente is short and thin and has dark skin, brown eyes, and short black hair.  His native language is Aymara, which is spoken locally, and he speaks Spanish for everyday use and business.  His shares his life with his wife, who works in agriculture.  They live in their own home, made of adobe with a corrugated metal roof and electricity and well water extracted with an electric pump.\r\n\r\nHe earns a living selling calves to fatten and sell.  He goes to fairs in neighboring communities.  \"I have raised livestock for as long as I can remember, and I take care of them with a lot of affection because they're part of my life,\" he said.

The group \u201cPanaderas de Cote\u201d (or \u201cThe Bakers of Cote\u201d) was named as such due to the fact that the members work in that trade, making traditional items like \u201cpan de piojo\u201d (or \u201clouse bread\u201d) and \u201cpan de monte\u201d (or \u201cmountain bread\u201d).\r\n\r\nHilaria is a member of the group, and everyone knows her for her friendliness and good disposition.

She comments, \u201cMy husband learned to make bread from his parents when he was very young.  Later, he taught me.\u201d  For this reason, when they decided to share their lives, they also decided to share their work.  They work on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and during the remaining days, they make deliveries in various municipalities and communities.  Grocery stories and businesses in the center of the municipality are their best customers.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful for the loans from VisionFund, since previously, she didn\u2019t have an oven, and she had to use one belonging to a family member.  But now, thanks to the loan, she was able to get her own, as well as build her house and buy a vehicle, which they use to transport their products.  Now, she is requesting a new loan to buy flour, firewood, and bags, with the goal of increasing her production and profits.  Right now, her biggest dream is to support her young son in his studies and improve his life.\r\n\r\nThe other member of the group are Carolina, who will buy lambs; Odilia, who will buy corn; Leticia and Victoria, who will buy bread; and Marcela, who will buy clothes.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken on the steps of the municipality\u2019s pavilion.

He can't do this with what he earns, however, so he's asking FUSAI for a loan to buy different sizes and styles of footwear for his business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":159.96,"image":{"id":1925981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy different sizes and styles of footwear for his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2015-07-20T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-19T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Alfonso ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":27.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":27.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":28.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":31.07},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":32.57},{"due_date":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2016-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":36.51},{"due_date":"2016-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":39.05},{"due_date":"2016-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":40.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.81},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.07},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.51},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.05},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.53,"local_amount":97.53,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":97.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711399871},{"amount":30.81,"local_amount":30.81,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":30.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730921052},{"amount":31.62,"local_amount":31.62,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":31.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752011804}],"funded_date":"2015-08-19T01:39:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":918264,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is single with four children, two of whom attend school.

Todas tienen un gran esp\u00edritu emprendedor, entre ellas existe un lazo de amistad muy fuerte que les permite superar cualquier reto. Est\u00e1n orgullosas de vivir en una comunidad como la suya ya que es una zona rodeada por vegetaci\u00f3n abundante y la poblaci\u00f3n dedica su tiempo al cultivo de ma\u00edz y la cr\u00eda de animales.\n   Lorena se caracteriza por su car\u00e1cter amable y su buen sentido del humor, aunque es muy joven tiene muy claros sus objetivos y pretende lograrlos gradualmente. Desde hace un a\u00f1o comenz\u00f3 con la venta de dulces en el exterior de su casa, su motivaci\u00f3n principal fue que justo frente a su hogar se localiza una escuela y los peque\u00f1os siempre buscan alg\u00fan caramelo al terminar las clases. \"En un inicio s\u00f3lo colocaba una peque\u00f1a mesa cubierta por un mantel frente a la puerta de mi casa y sobre ella algunos dulces\" coment\u00f3, actualmente y gracias al \u00e9xito obtenido ocupa dos mesas y las llena de una gran variedad de dulces y botanas. La actividad le ha resultado muy conveniente puesto que adem\u00e1s de generar ingresos, tiene el tiempo de cuidar y atender a su familia.\n   Con la ayuda del pr\u00e9stamo por parte de VisionFund comprara arena, grava, cemento, cal y varillas para construir un local ya que uno de sus sue\u00f1os es abrir una tienda de abarrotes junto con un molino. No obstante su sue\u00f1o m\u00e1s grande es el de poder ayudar a sus hijos para que terminen sus estudios y de esta manera obtengan una mejor calidad de vida. \n   Los dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Cecilia y Martha quienes invertir\u00e1n en la compra de borregos y Do\u00f1a Rosa Mar\u00eda, en becerros. \n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el quiosco del municipio, Lorena es quien viste la chamarra de color blanco.\n","en":"The group \u201cDivisi\u00f3n La Mesa Centro\u201d is made up of only women, who are hard-working and responsible, as well as happy and unassuming.  They all have a great enterprising spirit.  There exists between them a strong bond of friendship, which allows them to overcome any challenge.  They are proud of living in a community like theirs, since it is a zone surrounded by abundant vegetation.  The population dedicates its time to growing corn and raising animals.\r\n\r\nLorena is characterized by her friendly personality and her good sense of humor.  Although she is very young, she is clear about her goals, and she intends to achieve them gradually.  One year ago, she started out selling sweets outside her house.  Her primary motivation was that just in front of her house there is a school, and the children are always looking for some kind of sweet when their classes end.  She commented, \u201cAt the beginning, I would only put out a small table covered with a table cloth in front of the door to my house, with some sweets on top.\u201d  Now, thanks to the success she has had, she uses two tables, and she fills them with a great variety of sweets and snacks.  This business has been very beneficial, since in addition to generating income, she has the time to care for and attend to her family.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the loan from VisionFund, she will buy sand, gravel, cement, lime, and rods to build a shop, since one of her dreams is to open a grocery store along with a mill.  However, her greatest dream is to be able to help her children to finish their studies, so that way they can have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Cecilia and Martha, who will buy lambs, and Rosa Mar\u00eda, who will buy calves.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken at the municipality\u2019s pavilion.

She is single, without children, and her business is selling traditional food.\r\n\r\nShe is entrepreneurial, optimistic, dedicated, responsible, and very hard-working. Her business is located in the \"Plan 3000\" zone, where those affected by the overflow of the river make their home, situated 12 kilometers from the center of the city. The population arrived from the provinces and the rest of the country and settled in this zone, which today has more than 20% of the total population. It is the poorest district. It has a warm subtropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nDaniel has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair that she ties back in a pony tail, short stature, and a thin build. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks in her area, and she speaks Spanish because of general culture and for her business. She lives in the house of her parents, who work. They live in a house owned by the family and made of brick and cement with a tile roof and cement floor. It has potable water, electrical energy, and a sewer system. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling traditional food such as soup of dried grains (bone soup), fried rinds from little mountain collared peccaries, stuffed necks (necks from creole chickens, stuffed with potatoes and bananas), spicy cow's stomach (beef stomach, onions, and tomatoes accompanied by rice) and other dishes. She carries out her business at her regular sales stand from Monday to Saturday for the lunch and dinner hours. \"I began my business out of family tradition. I cooked since I was a little girl, and it is the moment to become independent,\" she comments.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she has experience in preparing food. This disadvantage is the lack of capital for the purchase of tables and chairs in order to sell food. Her dream is to have a restaurant. She wants to make the purchase of tables and chairs in order to become independent. This is her first loan sequence with the institution in the year that she has been working in this business independently.\r\n\r\nit is for these reasons that Daniela is applying for a loan for the

Her business is selling cosmetics.  She is a good mother, enterprising, strong, determined, optimistic, responsible, and very hard-working.  She carries out her business as a street vendor in the rural El Torno community, located 32 kilometers southeast of the city.  It is known for its picturesque landscape covered in tropical vegetation.  It has significant forest wealth and diversity of wild fauna.  It is a center for agricultural products, and has an average annual temperature of 24 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nMargarita is dark skinned; has brown eyes; and long, wavy, brown hair.  She is short and has a robust physique.  Her mother language is the Guaran\u00ed that she speaks at home, but she speaks Spanish in general public and for work.  (She is standing on the left, wearing a dark lilac shirt.)  She shares her life with her partner who works selling vegetables.  They live in their own family home, made of brick and cement.  It has a corrugated roof and a cement floor, and has well water extracted by a pump.  It has electricity but no sewage system.  \r\n\r\nHer desire to overcome made her form a communal bank of people so that they could seek a loan and improve their activities. Their businesses include a mechanic workshop, the sale of vegetables, the sale of fruit, the sale of food, the sale of secondhand clothing, the sale of natural medicine, and the weaving of blankets.  Margarita's business is selling cosmetics through a catalog as a street vendor.  She travels long distances in search of shops, clothing stores, offices, etc\u2026in order to find customers and sell her merchandise.  She carries out her work Monday through Friday during office hours, and on the weekends she improvises a stall in order to sell all day long at the fairs.  \"The obligations and expenses of my family force me to constantly search for new customers\u2026\", she says.  An advantage to her business is that her sales are 7 days a week.  A disadvantage is her lack of capital to buy merchandise in order to stabilize her business.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to improve her quality of life.  She wishes to buy wholesale cosmetics in order to stabilize her business and to help her children cover their expenses.  This is her second cycle of loans with the institution in the two years that she has carried out this activity.  It is for these reasons that Margarita seeks a loan in order to buy wholesale cosmetics to stabilize her business and to provide a better future for her family."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1925975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy wholesale cosmetics in order to stabilize her business and provide a better future for her family.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-20T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-19T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":5225,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arely Patric","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Simona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maryorit","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kilder Bran","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Angel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana Yurico","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-10T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":5225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-08T04:00:00Z","amount":3957.41},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T04:00:00Z","amount":4101.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T04:00:00Z","amount":4250.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T04:00:00Z","amount":4405.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T04:00:00Z","amount":4565.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T04:00:00Z","amount":4732.04},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T04:00:00Z","amount":4904.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T04:00:00Z","amount":5082.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":574.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":595.28},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":616.95},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":639.41},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":662.68},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":686.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":711.8},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":737.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":914239,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el joven a quien se le ha pixeleado la cara por tener 25 a\u00f1os de edad y vivir en zona de alto riesgo, se dedica al cultivo de ma\u00edz y frijol, tiene 8 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a la actividad agr\u00edcola, vende sus productos agr\u00edcolas en los alrededores de la zona donde el reside y con lo que obtiene de sus ganancia logra solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, el joven vive en casa propia con su esposa, el esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de semillas, fertilizantes, abonos, etc. y mejorar el terreno que muestra la fotograf\u00eda para continuar con su trabajo.

The inhabitants are also very hardworking and focused on the priorities of their home. A large part of the population grows corn and raises animals, a business that represents the bulk of the income for families. There are also small business like grocery stores, tortillerias and vegetable markets where a large variety of fruits and vegetables can be found. \r\n\r\nSince he was a child, Luis has been a very happy person. He is now 22 years old and maintains his good humor. He is married to Clarisa and they are the parents of two small girls who aren't yet in school. \"Since I was a child I have liked thrilling experiences, like being behind a wheel,\" said Luis. Seven years ago he was able to fulfill one of his dreams when his uncle gave him a taxi so that he could have his own business. However, his passion is music, \"He always showed an interest in singing and composing,\" said his sister Candelaria. Luis formed a music group with his father and brother. They are now well known and perform at social events like weddings, sweet sixteen parties, baptisms and other events. He has also invested part of his VisionFund loans in this business and he is very thankful. The money has allowed him to buy keyboards, speakers and lights. \r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Luis will invest his loan in a structure for a soloist since the one he currently has he bought four years ago when he first started the music group. Luis is very happy to have the opportunity to do what he loves most: to be on the stage and behind a wheel to be able to provide for his family. His current goals are to restore his musical equipment and to have better quality instruments.  In addition, his big dream is to sing on a larger stage with an audience from different areas. \"I want to compose an album and for my music to be well known,\" he said longingly. The other members of the group are Maria Estela and Feliciana who will invest in napkins and Luis Enrique who will invest in blacksmith materials. \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken next to Luis's taxi in the center of town, he is the one wearing a white shirt.*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1132.44,"image":{"id":1921393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical Performance","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"to build a new soloist stage.

It is said that selling several animals can bring in tens of rupees every year in profit, but it is just enough to cover food. What is left is not enough to invest more in the breeding business to get more income for the family.
