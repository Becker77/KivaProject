Sari-sari (a Filipino term for variety) stores sell different products like biscuits, candies, canned goods, noodles, toiletries and many other items that are needed for individual\u2019s daily living. This is considered as one of the most common businesses built by ordinary people since it provides necessities for the general public.\r\n\r\nMervel was encouraged to run this kind of enterprise. He is 29-year-old and single, residing in Oton, Iloilo. Despite his single status, his responsibilities cannot be underrated. Single people in the Philippines are expected to support their parents and siblings. But sometimes his income becomes unstable due to stiff competition and delayed payments of his customers. He longs to make his business more competitive by adding wide selections in his inventory. He needs PHP 15,000 supplementary capital to attain this. He wishes for your generous assistance and prays that more blessings be returned to you. \r\n\r\nHe hopes that his store will progress in due time. Personally, he also prays to have his own family to whom he can dedicate all his efforts.

Su negocio lo realiza en la localidad \u2018El torno\u2019, comunidad que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha experimentado un crecimiento en su demograf\u00eda debido a la emigraci\u00f3n de la poblaci\u00f3n del interior del pa\u00eds, el clima se caracteriza por ser sub tropical, al estar comprendido entre las llanuras y los valles mesot\u00e9rmicos, aunque se registran vientos fuertes y lluvias tormentosas en ciertas \u00e9pocas del a\u00f1o.\nDaniela es de tez morena, ojos marrones, cabello casta\u00f1o largo lo usa amarrado por detr\u00e1s, baja estatura, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica robusta, su lengua materna es el Guaran\u00ed que se habla en el lugar y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y por el negocio que realiza (esta sentada). Su vida la comparte con su pareja que trabaja repartiendo pan, viven en una casa propiedad de la familia construida de ladrillo y cemento con techo de calamina y piso de cemento que cuenta con agua potable, energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y alcantarillado. La necesidad de pagar los gastos m\u00e9dicos y posnatales de sus 3 peque\u00f1os hijos la oblig\u00f3 a formar una banca de personas con negocios como; venta de jugos naturales, venta de art\u00edculos de librer\u00eda, venta de ropa de segunda mano, venta de comida, artesan\u00eda en tela, elaboraci\u00f3n de sombreros de sa\u00f3 y taller de llaves, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y mejorar sus actividades.

Actividad que realiza en un cuarto de su casa habilitado como panader\u00eda, su esposo se encarga de la venta de forma ambulante a diferentes tiendas y puestos de venta, \u201ctrabajo desde mi hogar, mi trabajo comienza en la madrugada cuando mi hijos duermen y tengo el resto del d\u00eda para poder atenderlos\u2026\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que puede atender a su familia y trabajar, la desventaja es la falta de capital para la compra de harina para hornear continuamente y llegar a m\u00e1s clientes. Su sue\u00f1o es ver crecer a sus hijos sanos y fuertes, ella desea realizar la compra de diferentes tipos de harina por quintal. Esta es la 2 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 4 a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta actividad. \nEs por esos motivos que Daniela solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de variedades de harinas para hornear diferentes tipos de pan diariamente y cuidar a sus hijos el resto del tiempo.\n","en":"Daniela, 25, lives with her partner and three children: a newborn baby who is two months old, a 2-year-old and a 3-year-old.  She sells bread for a living.  She is a good mother and entrepreneur who is dedicated, consistent, kind, responsible and very hard working.  She works in the town of \"El Torno\" which is a community that has experienced demographic growth over the last few years due to immigration of people from further inland in the country.  The climate is subtropical as is it between the plains and mesothermic valleys, although there are strong winds and thunderstorms at certain times of year.\r\n\r\nDaniela has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long brown hair that she ties back, is of short height and has a robust physique.  Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed which is spoken locally and she uses Spanish for general purposes and in her business (she is the one seated in the photo).  She and her partner, who delivers bread, live in their own brick and concrete house which has a metal roof and concrete floor.  They have running water, electricity and a sewage system.  The need to pay for postnatal medical expenses for her three small children is what obliged her to set up a communal bank which includes businesses such as selling natural juices, stationery goods, second-hand clothing, food, fabric crafts, \"Sao\" hat manufacture and a keysmith.  The loan is to improve the group's businesses.\r\n\r\nDaniela makes and sells traditional bread such as rice flour bread, corn bread, milk bread, wheat cakes and others.  She works out of a room in her home that was remodeled into a bakery.  Her husband is the one who delivers the bread to different stores and stalls.  \"I work from home and start in the wee morning hours while my children sleep.  I have the rest of the day to care for them...\" she says.  The advantage of her business is that she can attend to both family and work responsibilities.  The disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy flour on a continuous basis and reach out to more customers.

She not only takes care of her children but has to take care of her elderly aunt who has become bed ridden due to old age and illness. Matsoe-peea lives in a small traditional hut that is not well ventilated, nor warms up well in winter. She works long hours to ensure there is enough food for her family.She has to wake up very early, between 3am and 4am, during the week to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water and warming the house for her young children who go to school and help bath her elderly aunt. Collecting firewood, setting up the fire and doing the actual cooking demands a lot of her time. Temperatures in the Lesotho highlands are never really high; winters can get very cold and often  Matsoe-peea has to start the fire inside her hut. Starting a fire releases smog and smoke which when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time can lead to lung diseases, eye problems and in the worst case to death. In these circumstances, life for women like  Matsoe-peea has been very difficult. ACE has requested a loan from Kiva lenders, in order to be able to sell on credit clean cook stoves which provide Matsoe-peea and 11 other people from her village, who are living in the same circumstances the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families, and that does not require a lot of wood, which is hard to find in Lesotho, nor expensive paraffin and gas . This stove can be started with the use of very little, readily available biomass like dry twigs and dry cow dung that do not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the homes. This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones and a mini LED lamp. A life improving package for these women. This stove saves them time to be with their family, saves energy, eliminates the element of toxic inhalation, house burning and has given them the freedom to have a better lit home to see better in the evening while cooking and enables children to do their homework.

Since then, their farm and family have grown in more ways than one. In 2010, the couple started working on a run-down farm. Today, they are making money off the poultry and dairy animals they raise and also the different variety of crops that they grow. Michael has further invested in a side business to supplement the meager income he earns from farming. \r\n\r\nMichael loves to dairy farm, especially since it was always a life goal of his to be a farmer. His wife understands this and together they joined hearts and hands to make the farm\u2019s success to date happen. \r\n\r\nMichael is seeking a loan to purchase a pedigree dairy cow. There are more than 100 cattle breeds in Kenya. However, not all are good producers of milk. In fact, very few are. Cattle aside, the tastes and preferences of milk in the market is really growing diverse in Kenya. Taking milk is no longer a matter of pouring it into our cereal bowl, adding it to our coffee, or drinking it straight from the glass, we now have preferences in the type of milk we drink. Today, milk consumers are spoiled for choice: In the market, we have old-fashioned cow\u2019s milk and lactose-free milk, not to mention non-dairy options such as soy, almond, rice and coconut milk. It takes dairy masters like Michael to pick these shifts in the market and adopt ingenious techniques in farming to ensure that their product qualities adapt to the changes in consumer preference. \r\n\r\nBuying a pedigree cow goes to show how Michael is keen on controlling lame levels in his dairy cattle. He considers breeding to be the core of his overall strategy of ensuring that milk quantity is way above average and the milk quality is second to none in the market. He anticipates that feeding will be his highest cost of milk production. This, to him, is accepted because to get cows that milk well and remain healthy, they have to be fed properly.

She is married to Roldan who is currently unemployed. It\u2019s just good that one of her children is already working and extends financial help to the family. But they still struggle with their everyday expenses. This is why Ninfa aspires to improve her business with the aid of additional capital amounting to PhP 10,000. \r\n\r\nShe will use it to buy more Personal Collection products that she can sell to her friends, neighbors and other network. She\u2019s positive that this additional capital will give her more profit. Her dream is to have a stable space or a showroom for her business someday. She also desires for good health, brighter future for her children and harmonious relationship among her family. \r\n\r\nShe meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1933490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more Personal Collection products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Oton, Iloilo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-20T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-19T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ninfa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2715.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523669},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2715.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434103},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3394.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955022},{"amount":30,"local_amount":1333.29,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1357.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044869}],"funded_date":"2015-07-20T15:26:42Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":918241,"name":"Emelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Emelyn and she's a sari-sari (variety) store owner in Oton, Iloilo. She's been running her store business for eight years now. She already experienced various circumstances that really tested her faith. There were times when her capital was almost drained due to huge collectibles. Some of her neighbors pay weeks or months later for the goods they get from her store. But Emelyn remained strong, because this is her way of assisting her foreman husband, Jeobert, in providing for their children\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nSari-sari store is comparable to a convenience store, but it\u2019s smaller and has limited products commonly used by an individual everyday. Examples of these products are sachets of toiletries, snack items, canned goods, instants, candies, beverages and other commodities. It\u2019s quite advantageous for the people in the community to have an accessible variety store to buy one candy, an egg, and so on. This is the reason why sari-sari stores proliferate in the communities of the Philippines. And the same reason why the competition becomes stiffer and stiffer. Customers prefer to buy from stores with wide selections and supplies. \r\n\r\nAs you can see in the picture, Emelyn has very limited stocks. She appeals for your help through a loan worth PhP 25,000 which she can use to buy more supplies to enhance her store. She aspires to improve her sales to be able to earn more. She dreams that in the near future her business will grow in progress. She\u2019s praying for a better life for her whole family.

She says it\u2019s not right to spend without limit, rather an individual should learn how to keep some amount in times of emergencies. For twenty years of business operation, she already gained enough knowledge and techniques on how to manage people and roll her capital. \r\n\r\nBut there are situations that she cannot control like the increasing price of raw materials and equipments for welding, the gasoline-diesel hike, and other related matters. When their welding contract with construction site ends, their income also stops. As the household finance manager, Erlinda has to adjust her family\u2019s everyday budget corresponding on her PUJ\u2019s income and occasional motorcycle sales. \r\n\r\nTo improve her welding business, she plans to expand her network of constructors. It would be best if she can get many welding contracts. She plans to buy new welding machine and more raw materials to get ready for possible higher demand. A loan amounting to PhP 35,000 would be very helpful. This may pave the way for her dream of putting up another shop in a more busy location.

The dances, dress, and values of the people in these places recall this past of which they are very proud. Equally, what defines this community is their work in agriculture, above all in growing sugar cane, lemons and papayas. \r\n\r\nThe Las Rosas group is from one of these communities and is made up of six enthusiastic women. They are Areli, who sells cosmetics and clothing from catalogs; Eva, food; Paola and Tomasa, cosmetics; Beatriz tacos; and Catalina, clothing and plastic containers from catalogs. \r\n\r\nBeatriz is better known as Bety in her community. She is also known for her good humor and her desire to get ahead. She is married to Antonio, from whom she learned the traditional work of making tacos, which he learned from his parents, so this work is considered a family tradition.  \r\n\r\nTwo years ago, the couple decided to establish their own taco shop because it is very easy for them to work as a team. So, while Bety prepares the vegetables, sauces and the seasonal water and cleans the shop, Antonio cooks the meat and makes the tacos according to the customer's taste. They have an extended schedule from 4:00 pm to 12:00 am and offer promotions of 2 x 1 on Wednesdays and Sundays. \r\n\r\nBetty is very happy with the business since with the earnings and the loans she has gotten, she has purchased chairs, tables, two refrigerators, a speaker, and then covered the household expenses. \"We have managed to open another taco shop, which has been satisfactory since it is the result of our work, efforts and commitment, she says, satisfied with her achievements. This time, she needs the loan to purchase meat, oil, tortillas, plates, napkin dispensers, salt shakers, tablecloths and three tables with the end of opening the new taco shop. \r\n \r\nAll the members of Las Rosas are grateful to those who make possible the opportunities for new loans with which they improve their businesses. \r\n\r\n*The photo was taken in Eva's business, who is wearing a pink blouse.

Other products from the land that are very important land for the economy of the region are mango, corn, lemon and banana. Here, the San Valentin group was formed on February 14; The members and their economic activities are:\r\n\r\nPaula -  Butcher\r\nRomualda, Adalberto -  Farming sugar cane\r\nSusana,  Juana - Selling fertilizer\r\nCelia, Adriana,  Marcelina - Selling \"antojitos\" (street food)\r\nYessica - Selling drinks\r\nLiliana, Felicitas, Felipa - Selling chicken \r\nMartina - Selling tamales and fertilizers \r\nEvarista, Imelda, Abrahan - Selling groceries \r\nFilogonia - Bakery \r\nLuisa \u2013 Selling tamales  \r\nPascuala - Selling sugar cane and street food \r\nJuliana - Selling clothing \r\n\r\nRomualda is a very hard working woman. In the community, she is known as \"Mualda\". She is married to Eduardo and they are parents of an 8 year old boy and a 5 year old girl. Both are sponsored by World Vision Mexico, a humanitarian institution partnered with VF Mexico that helps to improve the living conditions of children.\r\n\r\nMualda has lived in the same place since she was born. Her parents have been dedicated to farming sugar cane since it is the main activity of the area. Since she was young, she accompanied her parents to the field and there learned farm work. Seven years ago, she inherited part of her parents' land which allowed her to start her own business selling sugar cane. In the harvest season, Mualda's husband is in charge of burning the cane to proceed with the cutting and with supervising the workers who support them. Meanwhile she is in charge of preparing food for everyone and taking it to the field. After cutting, the workers form ridges or grooves in the land, which allows them to return to plant the product. They also intersperse bean and maize seeds to provide nutrients to the land so that it remains fertile. In the following months, the workers fertilize the land and clean it of brush that robs nutrients. To keep the land clean, Mualda and her husband go early with their hoes.\r\n\r\nThe previous loans have helped the pair to buy chemical and organic fertilizers and the income from selling cane pays their family expenses, their children's education, and to make repairs to their house. They need the current loan to buy chemical and organic fertilizers and two hand pumps to keep the land irrigated. To increase their income, Mualda plans to buy 5 hectares more of land where she will plant only maize and beans.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for trusting in us and providing us a new loan for our work, which is the source of our economic solvency to provide a good quality of life to our family.\"\r\n\r\n* The photograph was taken on the patio of Mualda's house.

She can help those students who need to research their school assignments, those families with members abroad who long to see each other through skype, and also those bored individuals who want to play online games. She is shooting two birds with one stone because she sells commodities while watching over her internet caf\u00e9. \r\n\r\nThere are times when her internet caf\u00e9 has few users. But during peak hours, customers line up to wait for their turn. Jodelyn wants to buy another computer to meet the needs of internet users during peak hours. She is requesting your help for an amount of PHP 20,000 for this purpose. She will use part of the loan to procure beverages for her store. This will ensure a higher profit for her so she can continuously support their daily expenditures and the educational expenses of her children. \r\n\r\nIn due time, she will establish another business like this in a more populous spot. She is doing all these efforts to give her children a brighter future. She is a compliant member of CCT Credit Cooperative and meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to inspire and strengthen each other through the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He has completed his Masters Degree from Rabindra Bharati University. Now he is pursuing a 3-year B.Ed. (Bachelor of Education) course with an aim to be a good teacher. His father is the only member of the family earning money. Through his tireless efforts he earns an amount which hardly covers their family expenses. But Khalinur is keen to provide her elder son with a good education so that he can lead a life far better than theirs. For this, she approached Kiva\u2019s partner BJS to fund for her son's education. \r\n\r\nShe wants to utilize the loan amount to purchase materials necessary for her son to study as well as a bicycle and she will pay course fees. She also hopes that Khadimul will help them financially by doing a job after completing his B, Ed. degree. \r\n\r\nKhalinur and Khadimul (as in the photo) are thankful to their lenders."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1933739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"To bear the expenses for her elder son's Bachelor of Education degree.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Falakata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2015-07-20T15:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-19T15:30:09Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khalinur","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-07-20T22:33:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":918389,"name":"Gehan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gehan is 44, married to a government official and has 3 children.

She has a secondary education.  She works as a cook in a cafe.  She also provides an additional income for her family by working in agriculture and animal husbandry.  She started these two activities 15 years ago with a capital of 1,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently owns one cow and ten sheep.  She also rents 0.5 hectares of irrigated land on which she grows barley annually for domestic consumption on the farm and for resale.

She currently handles a direct-selling business. She started only with a small amount of capital with which to buy her first products. But, because of her steadfast determination, she has now earned the trust of her customers. Although, there are times when she struggles, such as when there are delayed payments, she still works hard because she believes that such situations are an inevitable part of handling a business.\r\n\r\nShe is 43 years old, married to Dionirio and has three kids. She sells different kinds of products, mostly personal products like soaps, lotion, perfumes and the like. The profit she gets from the business becomes a great help for their family basically in terms of their daily expenses. \r\n\r\nRodelyn is a typical mother with a typical dream for her children. There is nothing more that she hopes aside from her children gaining a better quality of education and getting college degree. \r\n\r\nThat is the reason why she wants to further improve her resources.  If you would allow, she wants to ask for an 8,000 PHP loan which she will use for buying more products to sell. With this, she can surely gain more income. Part of what she will gain she will save for future investments and part will be used for their everyday living.  \r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll be a great blessing in advance. Thanks for your heartfelt generosity and goodness. \r\n\r\nRodelyn meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1932096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

It is the key to what you call \"success\". \r\nIt's heartbreaking to know that, around the globe right now, only a few percent of young students finish their college degrees. Worse, either they end up building a family at a young age or working for their family. \r\n\r\nBut Roselle holds a dream- a dream that she can't just let go just because of financial incapacity. She has the urge to study. In fact, she loves reading books and she enjoys her mathematics classes. She's taking up a Business Administration major in the Financial Management department at Trinity University of Asia. She's 17 years old and currently residing at Novaliches, Quezon City with her family. \r\n\r\n\"I see myself having a position someday in a certain company five to ten years from now. That's why I'm doing my best to maintain good grades.\", she said. \r\n\r\nHer mother operates a direct-selling business to support them (Roselle and her two siblings). School wasn't easy, she admits, especially when they have group work and lots of requirements. \"Though my first semester is not that challenging, I found myself realizing that I need to really become more responsible in managing my time. In college life, you really need to be independent.\" \r\n\r\nShe really wants to graduate and be successful someday. And that won't happen if she stops right now. She's almost near the finish line. With full hope, she believes that you'll help her.

Jyotsna wants to have their children properly educated. <br \/><br \/>Her 16-year-old elder daughter Ritu is a student in grade 11 who is a very intelligent student of Raichenga Vidyaniketan. Until now, she studied without the help of any private tutor. Now she needs private tuition for her further studies and enough study materials to secure good marks. Due to inadequate income, Jyotsna is taking out a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to buy educational equipment and pay her daughter\u2019s school fees, tuition fees, etc., so that she can pass all her regular examinations smoothly. <br \/><br \/>Jyotsna does not want her daughter to lose any educational years because she dreams of her daughter\u2019s uninterrupted education.

This is Adelaida. She is already 56 years old now and has three children. She manages her current sari-sari store business and is certainly hopeful for it to succeed. As of now, she is working persistently to provide for the daily needs of her household. \r\n\r\nSari-sari stores are often seen everywhere in the Philippines, most especially along the sidewalks and streets. It is most like a convenience store, but quite smaller than the usual and offers only limited products which are commonly needed, such as toiletries, food, instants, beverages and other commodities. Unlike grocery stores, sari-sari stores offer products at low-cost and on a retail basis, which is really an advantage for the customers.\r\n\r\nTo improve her sales, Adelaida likes to ask for help from you. She would like to borrow a loan worth 15,000 PHP that she will use to purchase additional products and merchandise items for her store. With this, she expects to grow her sales and provide a better solution for their family\u2019s daily living condition. And, today, you can be a big part of her life. \r\n\r\nRest assured that what you will entrust to her will have a better outcome. As was once quoted, \"A woman who walks in purpose doesn't have to chase people or opportunities.

In African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive hobby for farmers.

He buys mahogany or Gmelina wood lumber, and then he uses it to make simple furniture, including tables, chairs and cabinets. Sometimes he cuts it into strips of various sizes and sells them at retail. One paid helper assists him at his shop, which is located in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, one of the areas that was devastated by Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013. \r\n\r\nRehabilitation and construction of houses and other structures is still ongoing in this area, and the demand for furniture and lumber continues to increase. Armando wants to grab this opportunity to enhance his income, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s applying for a PHP 30,000 loan. He will use these funds to buy more mahogany and Gmelina wood to use as raw materials in his business. He is positive that he won\u2019t have any problem in paying the loan back, because he already has contact buyers. \r\n\r\nArmando is married to Erdelyn, and they have children who are still studying in college. He believes that education is very important, so he really strives to reach his dream that his children will have professions someday. He also aspires to own a family vehicle soon.

This is the main principle of people\u2019s solidarity in an organization or cooperative. \u201cThe people united will never be defeated\u201d states one famous Chilean song. This provides an interesting parallel with of Nenita\u2019s product \u2013 the broom or broomstick. She sells both soft brooms and hard brooms, often combined with a dustpan. \r\n\r\nThe soft broom is usually made of dried rice hay, while the hard broom is made of dried palm leaves. She pays three workers, who help her from manufacturing to delivery. She delivers her products on special order and also sells them along with other supplies in her variety store located in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nNenita is a widow who raises two kids, and sometimes her income doesn\u2019t suffice for their daily needs. She hopes to increase her income by producing more brooms and expanding her market. She will buy more raw materials to use in making brooms with the aid of her PHP 25,000 loan from kindhearted lenders like you. She will also use part of the loan to pay her workers. Payment for volume orders from her store sometimes comes in late, and she needs to adjust her cash flow so her workers\u2019 salaries won\u2019t be affected. Nenita is a devoted member of CCT Credit Cooperative, and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from their fellowship and the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":455.24,"image":{"id":1933518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy more raw materials to use in making brooms for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacolod City, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-20T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-19T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nenita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":143.76,"local_amount":6250.02,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":6506.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523689},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":4166.68,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4337.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434124},{"amount":119.8,"local_amount":5208.35,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5421.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955043},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":4166.68,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4337.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044890}],"funded_date":"2015-07-21T01:51:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tony Gooch","image":970369}},{"id":918249,"name":"Faith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faith is a widow and has been blessed with five kids who all attend school.

It\u2019s not really that effortless. Jenelyn, from Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, wakes up very early in the morning and goes to sleep late at night, in order to meet the demands of customers. Sometimes a customer knocks at the door at 4:30 am to buy one sachet of shampoo for five pesos. At times, she has to stay until 12 midnight to take the orders of a group drinking beer in front of her store. Jenelyn needs to be patient indeed, or else the customers will brand her as unfriendly and will patronize other stores. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a good thing that Jenelyn\u2019s husband, Nardie, takes turns in looking after the store. She can also rely on her children to watch the store after school. They share the task because their everyday needs are supported by the income from the variety store. However, the income from the store is not enough to meet the educational expenses of her children. This is why she also ventured into selling fish. She acquires fish from wholesalers early in the morning and sells them in the market. She\u2019s determined to improve her business and increase her profit, and she is seeking to obtain additional capital of PHP 50,000, which she will use to buy different varieties of fish in volume. She will also add more dry goods, grocery items, and soft drinks to her inventory. She dreams of having a stable business and a new house and lot some day, but her top priority is to see her children with completed college degrees. \r\n\r\nJenelyn shares her aspirations with her co-fellowship* members, who meet every week to strengthen each other through the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750.03,"image":{"id":1933533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy different varieties of fish in volume, for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacolod City, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-20T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-19T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":328.16,"local_amount":14583.31,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":14850.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434126},{"amount":187.52,"local_amount":8333.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8486.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955045},{"amount":234.35,"local_amount":10416.65,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":10607.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044892}],"funded_date":"2015-08-13T11:10:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tony Gooch","image":970369}},{"id":918494,"name":"Who Bear Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is forty-five years old Fasia, married with three children, all are school going children.

He has been blessed with a lovely family and has been practicing farming for the past nine years and has never looked back. \r\n\r\nHis primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crops. Most of the small holder farmers in Kiriti village own approximately half an acre per household and this has made them work extra hard to fully utilize their farms. Anthony has been practicing mixed farming and he enjoys the income he gets, but he has been facing challenges delivering his products to the market. Kiriti village is a very remote area and the roads are in pathetic condition; this has hampered Anthony from making timely delivery of products to the market while still fresh. Anthony sells vegetables, milk and tomatoes which are very perishable and require quick delivery if you are to fetch a high price. \r\n\r\nAnthony is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike that will help him deliver his products to the market in a timely way so he can overcome the challenge of facing losses. Through the loan he will deliver the products quickly to the market and this means he will never suffer losses, which will translate into an immediate increase in profits. \r\n\r\nAnthony plans to employ someone who will help him on the farm and deliver products to his large client base.

You don't have to have a college degree to serve. You don't even have to make your subject and your verb agree to serve. You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.\" \r\n\r\nThis is \"truth-alive\" in most entrepreneurs like Mary Grace. She serves people by giving massages in exchange for a given price. She is not a professional worker, and what she receives from clients usually doesn't meet her family needs. She's also not that witty, like those working in high-paying jobs. Despite that, she is still willing to work, because she believes that she has the skills and the passion to serve people and to work for her loved ones. \r\n\r\nHer job is never easy. It's obviously energy-consuming and, at times, especially in rainy seasons, she encounters difficulty in attracting customers. In jobs like this, it's automatically \"no client, no income.\" But Mary Grace is thankful that she continues to earn from this job enough to supply her family's basic household necessities. \r\n\r\nToday, she is thinking about further enhancing her inventory. She wants to buy additional materials for her massage business. To that end, she would like to borrow 15,000 Philippine pesos. This loan would be so essential in elevating the quality of service that she is able to offer her customers. With better equipment, it would be easier for her to catch people's interest and earn better than before. \r\n\r\nIf she continued to earn well, she would have the opportunity to save money for her dream, which is to have her own spa salon someday. Today, she only prays for good health for her family members. \r\n\r\nShe meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and also to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet weekly. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":233.36,"image":{"id":1932379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

variety store in Caloocan City. The help of a previous loan was indeed a great remedy for her family's daily expenses. It was a relief for the household and, at the same time, a hope for a better future. \r\n\r\nSo far, Teresita's store is running well. But she needs a little help to continue her business operations. She requests 40,000 Philippine pesos to supply her store with more grocery items to sell. With additional supplies, she will be able to cater to customer demands while benefiting from an anticipated increase in profits. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that you can help her with this request, because her store is a very relevant source of income for the family, especially since Fernando (her husband) has already retired from work. That's why Teresita hopes very much that you will lend her your helping hands. \r\n\r\nSomeday, she dreams about her business expanding and growing it into a grocery store. \r\n\r\nTeresita meets weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1932128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She started rearing livestock and growing crops in 2009 for a source of income for her family. Thanks to her hard work, today Nasibahan has two cows.

and a married mother of four dependent children, three of whom are in school and the other one is under the age of school. She is fishing in the inland water to earn the main income to support her family. Meanwhile, she is also growing rice to supplement income. Now, the rice farming business is in danger as there is shortage of water and fertilizers to supply the farmland.

She is a 48-year-old married woman. Her three daughters are married.  Sumitra received a primary level education in her young age but she is very much eager to give her only son the best education he deserves. \r\n\r\nSumitra's son Sujit is 18 years old. He is in B.A. (Bachelor of Arts) in the first Year in Falakata College. He is a hard working student and wants to be a teacher in the future. But his marks are not good enough in earlier exams. So he needs proper guidance to improve him and prepare for competitive exams. \r\n\r\nSumitra's husband has a small shuttering business. His income covers the household expenses but he cannot afford the whole education cost of their only son. Sometimes they cannot even provide necessary books for their son.

Su econom\u00eda gira entorno a la agricultura, sobretodo en el cultivo del ma\u00edz, y de igual forma a la elaboraci\u00f3n de artesan\u00edas ya que las mujeres mazahuas se caracterizan por ser las mejores artesanas de la regi\u00f3n.\n   Do\u00f1a Julia es una mujer trabajadora, proviene de una familia muy numerosa cuyos valores mantiene para transmitirlos a sus propios hijos. Por cierto tiempo trabaj\u00f3 en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico como empleada dom\u00e9stica, sin embargo el hecho de no atender a su familia la hizo regresar a su comunidad y dedicarse por completo al cuidado de sus hijos y  su actividad.

Their economy revolves around farming, especially of corn, as well as handicrafts. The Mazahua women are known to be the best artisans in the region.\r\n\r\nJulia is a hard-working woman from a family with many values that she wants to keep and pass on to her own children. For a while, she worked in Mexico City as a housekeeper, but being away from her family made her return to her community and devote herself entirely to taking care of her children and working on her craft.\r\n\r\nFrom a young age, her mother taught her the art of embroidery. She recalls with a smile when her older sister made fun of how her first embroidery was very messy and resembled the family dog's tangled fur.\r\n\r\nShe is currently one of the best artisans in the region, and many of her pieces are specifically requested for religious celebrations like weddings, baptisms, communions, etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore, she is asking for a loan through VisionFund to buy fabric, thread and yarn. \r\n\r\nThe embroidery business has been very good for her whole family, and she has retained a very reliable clientele.
