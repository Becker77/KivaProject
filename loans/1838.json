Sahak keeps livestock and also cultivates land. It gives him an opportunity to sell some vegetables, crops, meat and cheese that he makes with his wife. This brings not a lot but nevertheless some income to the family. Sahak is married and lives with his wife, son, and parents. There are a lot of financial needs in this family and all family members work hard to handle difficulties. \r\n\r\nSahak asks for this loan of USD 800 to purchase forage for feeding his livestock and fertilizer for land cultivation. Sahak's loan has been approved within the joint initiative between SEF and Kiva, which provides loans to the underserved population of the Shirak region, to help them to access the market and earn a living. Shirak is considered to be a poor region, with a high unemployment rate, and low living standards. Lack of access to loan products, bad market conditions, and high costs makes a number of difficulties for people to develop their business in the Shirak region.

She is a 39-year-old smallholder farmer based in Nkubu, which is a small rural town in Central Kenya. Penina and her husband have been blessed with two children. For 15 years, Penina has been a mixed farmer. She keeps dairy cattle and poultry on her farm. She also grows different varieties of crops. Despite prevailing animal diseases, she finds dairy farming to be the most enjoyable commercial farming activity. Besides dairy farming, she has a deep connection with gardening. In African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive, hobby for women. You really don't have to be born with a green thumb to give life to a glorious garden; any woman with a homestead and a few square feet of earth is doing her best to make her little corner of the world more gracious and beautiful. Penina, however, is taking this a little step further. She is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming. This is a big deal for her. She is very excited to start growing different varieties of crops for commercial purposes. The demand for vegetables and other greens is always high. Income from this venture will cover the high farming expenses she has to deal with currently. In the long run, with increased income, she will finally be able to satisfy her family\u2019s basic needs."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":63.93,"image":{"id":1934320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seeds and start horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-21T03:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-20T03:10:10Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Penina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.57},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.35},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.83},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":18.64,"local_amount":1863.62,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1912.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711507072},{"amount":12.58,"local_amount":1257.95,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1290.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023897},{"amount":32.71,"local_amount":3271.16,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3356.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112022}],"funded_date":"2015-07-21T19:49:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kristin Simpson","image":null}},{"id":918830,"name":"Elvira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvira works hard to support her family.

accomplished farmer from the Bomet area of Kenya and commands a lot of respect. He is happily married and, together with his beautiful wife, is blessed with three children. \r\n\r\nFor the past eight years he has been involved in mixed farming and because of the immense knowledge he has on farming, farmers from his village and neighboring villages troop to his home to seek technical advice on the best farming techniques. \r\n\r\nHis primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and some personal businesses he engages in to make extra income. Joseph sells poultry to his neighbors and to the local market to make more money. His work is not without challenges he says, though he is regarded as the best poultry farmer in his village. He has been unable to meet the market demand, which has resulted in a loss of tenders. One of his neighbors ordered 100 crates of eggs which he was unable to supply. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry so that he can satisfy the demand. Through Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance business that supports small scale farmers, Joseph is confident that this loan will permanently change his life. \r\n\r\nIncreased profit from poultry selling will allow him to afford his highest monthly expenses - farm-related comforts and the ability to channel a surplus amount to his children's education. \r\n\r\nJoseph is a visionary and plans that through increased profits, he will be able to start a large shop for selling eggs and poultry meat."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":30.26,"image":{"id":1934334,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bomet","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-21T03:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-20T03:20:04Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":707.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":728.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":749.7},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":771.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":794.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":817.37},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":841.26},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":865.84},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":891.15},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":917.19},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":944},{"due_date":"2016-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":971.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.72},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.94},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.17},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.41},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.66},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.91},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.17},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.44},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":7.76,"local_amount":775.94,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:50Z","rounded_local_amount":796.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711507073},{"amount":6.94,"local_amount":694.49,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":712.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023898},{"amount":15.56,"local_amount":1555.61,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1596.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112023}],"funded_date":"2015-07-21T10:58:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":918841,"name":"Juliet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliet is 30 years old and married with one child.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

He is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge he has about farming, he commands a lot of respect from other farmers in his village. Dairy farming is close to his heart; every day he wakes up to milk his cow and that makes him very proud. Although he makes profits through milk selling, he lacks a proper dairy unit and he is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan he will have a humble time milking his cow and also feeding it. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from getting diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain.

He is 65 years old and has 11 children ranging from three months to 33 years of age, one of whom is currently attending school. Zancoura decided to become a farmer because he liked this work and felt ready to tackle it. He grows peanuts, corn, millet, sorghum and cotton on his field of 15 ha [37 acres], facing challenges such as droughts. \r\n\r\nThis year  Zancoura's wish is to buy a seeder in order to be able to work his land with a more efficient tool. Having a seeder will allow him to work faster  and get less tired. With the increase of his yield and his revenues, Zancoura hopes to ensure a constant food supply for his family and buy motorbikes for his children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":217.14,"image":{"id":1927954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy a precision seeder.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Zelabougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-07-21T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-20T04:00:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zancoura","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":59374},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":7187},{"due_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":7187},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":12187},{"due_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":17187},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":22187},{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":24691}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.85},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.18},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":172.45,"local_amount":94061,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":102155.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696611780},{"amount":44.69,"local_amount":24374,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":26471.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731047374}],"funded_date":"2015-07-21T14:24:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":918849,"name":"Amjad\u2019S Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amjad lives in K.N Shah, a native village in Gujranwala, Pakistan.

She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":277.1,"image":{"id":1752435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay for the maintenance of her tricycle unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-21T05:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-20T05:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Junalyn ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.54,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3960.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523692},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2640.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434128},{"amount":58.32,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2640.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955047},{"amount":72.9,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3300.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044894}],"funded_date":"2015-07-22T02:12:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":918706,"name":"Nat's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nat\u2019s group lives in a rural village in Battambang province in Cambodia.

Aside from her poultry business, as shown in her current photo, she is also a jeepney operator, which her husband drives as a transportation service in their town.\r\n\r\nShe trusts that she can avail herself  of a PHP 30,000 loan to pay for the registration, fuel and changing the oil of her jeepney. It is very important to regularly maintain her jeepney to ensure safe and efficient service. Negligence to properly maintain her jeepney will disrupt its service and in turn affect their means of income. She thanks God and you for your good heart as you assist her in their livelihood.\r\n\r\nMa. Theresa dreams for her poultry farm and transportation service to grow. She desires for all her children to get a college education to allow them better opportunities in life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Living in an agricultural country, he takes advantage of the good weather and fertile soil at Silang, Cavite. His proceeds from his farm helped support his family and meet their daily basic needs.\r\n\r\nHe hopes to avail himself of an another 20,000 PHP loan, which he will use to maintain his farm and buy more fertilizer for a productive pineapple harvest. Unfortunately, his farm produce suffered when his country was hit by the recent typhoon. Despite some loss, Honorio keeps his positive outlook and faith that God will see them through to provide for their needs. He is thanking you for your good heart for supporting his livelihood.\r\n\r\nHonorio's precious dream is to have a consistently productive harvest, and he prays for God's abundance in their lives.

In 2014, N\u1ee5 joined Thanh Hoa Microfinance Institution to improve her business. N\u1ee5 and four other women established the loan group \"N5KP8Ba \u0110\u00ecnh- Loans change our life\" to get loan and share experience to do business for a better life. N\u1ee5 has successfully repaid two loans from Thanh Hoa Microfinance Institution. She is a reputable person in the community. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to purchase more cakes, sweets, sugar and milk to resell. With her business profit, N\u1ee5 hopes for her family to be healthy and happy, for her business to do well, and to travel for vacation within the country."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1918318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more cakes, sweets, sugar and milk to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Vietnam","town":"Thanh Ho\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":121,"posted_date":"2015-07-21T09:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-20T09:50:05Z","loan_amount":4600,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Th\u1ef1c","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ch\u00edn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thoa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"N\u1ee5","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":100000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":4600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5565000},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2016-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2016-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2016-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2016-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2016-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2016-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2016-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2016-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5555000},{"due_date":"2016-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5555000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.53},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shilpa Pullela","image":1721739}},{"id":914797,"name":"Katherine Roxana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Katherine Roxana se dedica al negocio de prestar servicios de publicidad a diferentes empresas, la socia es una mujer emprendedora y trabajadora que por medio de este trabajo saca adelante a su familia.

Hasmik's family owns a piece of land where they grow cabbage and tomato, which they sell in local markets. Besides agriculture, Hasmik also works in the village school's library. \r\n\r\nHasmik now asks this loan to purchase fertilizer, 3 oxen and give salaries to workers who helped with land cultivation works. She hopes very much that Kiva will support her and help to better her family's poor living conditions.\r\n\r\n This is Hasmik's second loan. Unfortunately, the first loan, which she got from local financial institutions previously, was very difficult to return back, and Hasmik faced some difficulties. However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, she and her family were able to run their agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that they will be able to cover the monthly payments. \r\n\r\nSo, Hasmik has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.

He wakes up very early in the morning when the birds are still asleep to go and tend to his small parcel of land. Evanson is a 40-year-old farmer from Mitunguu village, situated in Nkubu area of Kenya. He lives together with his wife and three children, on a small piece of land where he keeps cows,pigs and grows a wide variety of crops. For ten years, his primary sources of income have been pig farming, milk and horticultural produce. His biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals to prevent these diseases.\r\n\r\nEvanson made a decision to join Juhudi Kilimo, in order to access loans that would help him improve his farming activities. Sometime last month, he applied for a loan to buy seeds and expanding his horticulture farm. This will enable him to expand his operations, to increase the overall output.\r\n\r\nThe additional income from the expansion will go to his children's education.

One of their worries is the lack of toilets at their premise and hence their interest in joining the Fresh Life Toilets Initiative.\r\n\r\nBy joining this movement, Philip hopes to simultaneously provide sanitation services to the children joining the school, his tenants and learn a lot about sanitatio, including how he can be more involved in overall sanitation improvement in his area. \r\n\r\nLet us help Philip acquire two Fresh Life Toilets!

Neighbours have been flocking to his compound to buy eggs and through word of mouth, news has spread like fire in the whole village that he has quality eggs. \r\n\r\nThe demand is so high, he cannot fully satisfy it. He is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan he will be able to satisfy the demand, and this will translate to increased income levels. \r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders, Enock believes that small-scale farmers like him will be able to benefit from financial solutions. Poultry meat is a very popular meal among many people in his village, and this translates to improved income and better living standards. \r\n\r\nEnock will sell eggs for commercial purposes and for home consumption. Increased income will allow Enock to provide nothing but the best for his family and improve his living conditions. Other than profits, he will benefit from poultry manure and poultry feathers, which will help improve his life.\r\n\r\nLend to this enterprising Kenyan farmer!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":60.21,"image":{"id":1934489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy additional poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bomet","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-21T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-20T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enock","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.57},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.35},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.83},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":15.13,"local_amount":1512.92,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1552.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711507078},{"amount":13.7,"local_amount":1369.66,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1405.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023902},{"amount":31.38,"local_amount":3138.37,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3220.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112028}],"funded_date":"2015-07-22T20:33:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":914865,"name":"Isabel De Los Dolores","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Isabel de 35 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su compa\u00f1ero de vida y sus tres hijos dos mayores y uno menor de edad.

She is studying in B.A. (Bachelor of Arts) 2nd year in Falakata College. She is a hard-working student and wants to be a teacher in the future.  She needs proper guidance to excel and prepare for competitive exams. Chandramani's husband is a farmer by trade. His income covers the household expenses but cannot afford the whole education cost of their only daughter. Sometimes they cannot even provide necessary books for their daughter. As such, providing her (Doli) with private coaching is too difficult for them to manage. \r\n\r\nSo to solve this problem Chandramani had applied for an educational loan from BJS (Kiva's partner). The loan amount will be utilized for purchasing her daughter's necessary textbooks, paying all college fees, and for enrolling her in a private coaching class. Chandramani is hopeful that the loan will help her daughter to go one step closer to her goals.\r\n\r\nChandramani and Doli (as seen in the photo) express their gratitude towards their generous lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1934537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"To cover all the education-related costs of her daughter.

Though his income is scanty, he is striving hard to provide an education to his children. <br \/><br \/>Usha's elder son, Biswajit, is 18 years old and pursuing his Bachelor of Arts from Falakata College.

Both Usha and her husband have great expectations for their elder son. They expect he will achieve high educational qualifications to compete with progressive people in social status.

Life in the Philippines is quite hard and most families struggle to make ends meet. Being a strong, business-minded woman, she finds ways and means to earn as much as she can to provide for her family's basic needs and to send her daughter to high school.\r\n\r\nElizabeth is thankful that God has blessed her with a general store and a junk shop business. She buys essential food items such as canned goods, coffee, biscuits, beverages and toiletries from wholesalers and then sells them at retail prices. She also buys and collects scrap metal and sells it to foundries. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand operations of her store she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan to buy more grocery items such as canned goods, instant noodles, biscuits, bread, eggs, etc. to sell at her small store. Although she finds it hard at times to collect from those who buy on credit, she is still grateful that God provides enough for their basic needs. She is thanking God and you in advance for your good heart and the financial aid that will be given to her. \r\n\r\nElizabeth dreams that someday she will own a bigger grocery store. She prays that they will have a house of their own.

The name was chosen because the group must be polished in order to become perfect just like the precious stone, while the number references the amount of members. They are: Mar\u00eda R., Ang\u00e9lica R., and Mar\u00eda Luisa V, who sell groceries; Mar\u00eda, typical snacks; Olga, plastic containers and air time; Iris, shoes; Patricia, chickens; Flora, bread; Lirio, sewing; Francisca and Marbella, cosmetics; Ang\u00e9lica M., plastic containers; and Jorge, who provides taxi service.\r\n\r\nMrs. Flora is an incredibly responsible woman. She is the mother of a 16 year old and 8 year old. After becoming a single mother, she decided to begin an activity that could help her to solve her family's needs; thus, she started selling pan. In the beginning, she started by selling twice a week, running through the streets of her community, selling on average 300-350 pieces of fresh bread. Nevertheless, growth has been gradual and she currently sells 1000 pieces of bread and 300 puff pastries each week. With help from her previous loan, she was able to buy a motorcycle which made distribution quicker and allowed her to cover more territory. Her success comes from the flavor of the bread baked in stone ovens over a wood fire, as well as prices, accessibility, and her amiable treatment of customers. \"Nowadays I buy bread, but I will have my own bakery which will be my legacy for my children,\" she commented, satisfied.\r\n\r\nEven though sales increase in the rainy season, it becomes more complicated to transport her products, therefore her goal is now to buy a car to transport the bread more securely. Additionally, she wants to begin raising pigs and thus will buy a female pig, food, and bread.\r\n\r\nThe group El Diamante 13 is grateful for the trust placed in them. The only thing they want is to elevate their businesses and generate more income. \r\n\r\n*Photograph is in the house of Mrs. Flora, who wears a blue shirt; the taxi that one can barely see belongs to Jorge."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":1917863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy a pig, food and bread for resale.

The main products that she sells are rice, oil, beans, bread, eggs, snacks, and sodas, but she also sells \"pupusas\" [thick, stuffed, handmade corn tortillas] on weekend afternoons. Her granddaughter helps her take care of the shop while she makes the pupusas.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting from CREDICAMPO is to invest in the shop and to buy corn, beans, and other necessary household goods. In this way, she intends to stimulate her business and to be able to offer a greater variety of products to her customers.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of being able to keep working and to increase sales in her little shop. In addition, she dreams of improving her house little by little so that they can live more comfortably."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":118.25,"image":{"id":1927377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to invest in her store and to buy corn, beans, and other necessary household products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-07-22T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-21T02:10:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Efigenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":29.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.85},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":31.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":29.95},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":32.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":33.05},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":34.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":36.98},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":36.59},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":38.58},{"due_date":"2016-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":39.14},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.87},{"due_date":"2016-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.86},{"due_date":"2016-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":44.78},{"due_date":"2016-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2016-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2017-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2017-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":51.2},{"due_date":"2017-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2017-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":54.77},{"due_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":56.77},{"due_date":"2017-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":68.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.84},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.87},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.05},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.17},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.98},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.59},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.14},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.87},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.86},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.78},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.2},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.77},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.77},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.61,"local_amount":57.61,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":57.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711455075},{"amount":30.3,"local_amount":30.3,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":30.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730975592},{"amount":30.34,"local_amount":30.34,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":30.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752064100}],"funded_date":"2015-08-21T01:02:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":914918,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Angel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel, es un peque\u00f1o productor que tiene una peque\u00f1a finca en el norte de Nicaragua, con una extensi\u00f3n con cafetos de 2 mz.
