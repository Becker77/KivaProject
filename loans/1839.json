His principal crop is coffee, and through his coffee he has gotten his children ahead. For over 15 years he has managed his small farm of approximately 17 acres, which he has improved over the years and on which he plants about 3.5 acres of coffee. His farm has been certified as fair trade by U.T.Z. and also by C.A.F.E. Practices. Over the last three years his average yield has been 15,000 lbs of certified coffee. The greatest challenge Denis has faced in his coffee production has been the presence of pests and diseases, which he is sure he'll be able to control with a proper fertilization plan. For this reason he is requesting a loan to purchase supplies and fertilizers which will enable him to maintain his plantation adequately. \r\nDenis' goal is to continue improving his land through this integrated management plan which will enable him to continue investing gradually in the development and diversification of the farm. Through careful technique and hard work he will achieve this goal and continue providing for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1927389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"to purchase supplies and fertilizers which he will use on his coffee plantation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":295,"posted_date":"2015-07-22T05:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-21T05:00:01Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Denis Alfredo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1475,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kati Mayfield","image":470169}},{"id":919256,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is 36 years old, married, has three children of school age and lives at Pagadian City, Zamboanga del Sur.

Farming allows him to ensure his family's independence, but it also a family tradition. It is his household's principal source of income and food sufficiency. All these factors, as well as a love for the profession, led Lassine to become a farmer. He cultivates maize, rice and vegetables on his four-hectare plot of land. As a farmer, he has to face many difficulties, such as a lack of rain and a lack of farming equipment, as well as a lack of quality fertilizer.\r\n\r\nThis year, he wanted to purchase a seed-drill for growing maize. He doesn't have enough cash to purchase one, which is why he wants this loan. Access to a seed-drill will allow him to quickly and efficiently carry out his work. Lassine hopes that with the increase in his crop yield and his revenue, he will be able to pay for his children's school fees and ensure his family is well fed."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":199.14,"image":{"id":1928195,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a precision seed-drill","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Samale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2015-07-22T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-21T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lassine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":59374},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":7187},{"due_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":7187},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":12187},{"due_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":17187},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":22187},{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":24691}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.85},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.18},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":132.11,"local_amount":72061,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":78262.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696611788},{"amount":35.52,"local_amount":19374,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":21041.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731047378},{"amount":31.51,"local_amount":17187,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-19T13:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":18666.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":753358904}],"funded_date":"2015-07-23T21:00:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christopher Smith","image":null}},{"id":919401,"name":"Yousef","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yousef is a 19-year-old single man from Khanyounis, which is both a city and a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip where unemployment is very high.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.

She is married and has three children. She works in a small village. Since childhood she dreamed of becoming a teacher, but the circumstances were such that, due to her family\u2019s financial insecurity, she could not attend college. Right after finishing secondary school Busoliha was married off. This is how she became a homemaker. But even  though staying at home she is never idle. She and her husband do all they can to provide their children with all necessities. \r\n\r\nIn order to have a reliable source of income, Busoliha and her husband launched their own business. They raise livestock. Busoliha  raises cattle and then sells meat and milk. She obtains a decent revenue, but at present she and her husband do not have sufficient means to cover all their needs.

Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":133.35,"image":{"id":1935308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2015-07-22T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-21T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Subhadra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3384.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696722798},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T18:15:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3384.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711654329},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3384.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731158893},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:04:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3384.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752246606}],"funded_date":"2015-07-22T15:59:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kristin Simpson","image":null}},{"id":919456,"name":"Marivic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marivic is 48 years old and has three children.

Therefore, she wants to borrow a loan for this purpose.\r\nShe hopes the loan amount will help her family tend well the custard apple and longan orchard. Then, the next crop of custard apple and longan will bring her family a considerable profit.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1464.51,"image":{"id":1935487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Vietnam","town":"Mai S\u01a1n - S\u01a1n La","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":363,"posted_date":"2015-07-22T16:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-21T16:10:04Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"H\u01b0\u1edfng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":40000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2504000},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":833000},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":833000},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":833000},{"due_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":833000},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833000},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833000},{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":833000},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833000},{"due_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833000},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833000},{"due_date":"2016-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":833000},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":347.06,"local_amount":7504000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":7543349.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711522107},{"amount":963.25,"local_amount":20827000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-18T12:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":20936211.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731037958},{"amount":154.2,"local_amount":3334000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3351482.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752126856}],"funded_date":"2015-08-20T21:33:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":919503,"name":"Cuc's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Cuc, born in 1972, is the Thai ethnic woman.

Her business is selling second hand clothing.<br \/><br \/>She is a good mother, independent, consistent, optimistic, responsible and very hard-working. Her business is located in the 'Cotoca\u2019 neighborhood which is 20 km east of the city. It is known for it's traditional food and it's Saint's day where the believers travel by foot. It has a subtropical hot climate with a daily temperature that varies between 21 and 35 degrees Celsius. <br \/><br \/>ROSSMERY is dark skinned, has brown eyes, long black hair that she ties back in a ponytail, is short and of robust physique. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed that she speaks in her home and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and for her business. (In the photo she is the center wearing a striped sweater). She shares her life with her partner who works as a builder and her son who is not yet school age. They live in a house that belongs to the family and is built of brick and cement with a metal roof and a cement floor. It has pumped well water and electricity but no sewage. <br \/><br \/>Her desire to excel led her to form a group with people with businesses like: a motorcycle taxi service, ceramic handicrafts, weaving, selling meals, selling bread and the sales of soft drinks, to request a loan and improve their businesses. Her business is selling second hand clothing. Her day begins very early in the morning so she can get to her sales stand before the sun rises. Her clients come from nearby cities to buy wholesale. At 9 o'clock she and her fellow vendors must leave the streets when the commercial stores open. Loaded down with clothing she heads to her storage, puts it in and locks it. \"My business is itinerant, this gives me the chance to visit different clients\" she comments.

Indira's oldest daughter is in 8th grade, her son is in 5th grade, and her youngest daughter is in 2nd grade. Indira has a university education. She always tries to give her children only the best, which is why she works hard and keeps her nose to the grindstone. For six years Indira has been transporting and selling fruits and vegetables. She drives her cargo minibus over sometimes dangerous mountain passes four times a month to bring fresh fruits and vegetables from Uzbekistan in the spring, and the cities of Bishkek and Osh in the summer, and sells them to retailers on consignment. For her job as a driver, she receives 5,000 KGS for one trip. She has regular and loyal customers. Indira delivers produce around the village, giving them to sellers on consignment and recording everything in a notebook. Certainly there are months when sales are weak; the lucrative months are November and December, and the average months are September and October. Indira's monthly income is on average 28,000 KGS. Indira also sells watermelons and apples, which she brings from Issyk-Kul Province in neighboring Kazakhstan. Indira's older daughter helps her with everything and looks after the younger children when Indira is on a trip to pick up produce. Indira knows that her daughter will need to enroll in college soon and will need school supplies, so she has decided to open a new business and work in animal husbandry as well. She remembers how, as a child, she used to help her parents with keeping livestock. This will be her new start-up-type business. Indira intends to purchase livestock and renovate the barn. She has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 150,000 KGS. She will use a portion of the loan to purchase a dairy cow to produce organic milk, which is in high demand, and which will also be used for her children. With 30,000 KGS she will purchase some sheep, and with the rest she will puchase building materials for renovating the barn. Indira is used to everything being in order. She has calculated that her expected profit from sales and her new animal husbandry business will increase to approximately 29,300 KGS. This will allow Indira to start saving up for her daughter's college education."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1911445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to start a new business by purchasing a dairy cow and some sheep and to construct a barn for the livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Talas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-07-22T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-21T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":2400,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Indira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amanda Rempel","image":21745}},{"id":919627,"name":"Violeta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Violeta is 50 years old and widowed with four children.

In the future, Chanat Devi plans to improve her family's economic conditions. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn Nepal, furniture is still made the old-fashioned way. Using little more than basic hand tools, skilled artisans form raw lumber into beautifully finished pieces of furniture. With precision and an eye for detail, furniture makers produce shelves, bed frames, and cabinet sets. With the help of a Kiva loan, a furniture maker is able to increase the volume of their lumber purchases or hire additional labor. This additional leverage allows an entrepreneur to increase productivity and profitability."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1935388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To buy wood and tools for furniture making","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2015-07-22T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-21T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chanat Devi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2538.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696722808},{"amount":25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T18:15:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2538.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711654339},{"amount":25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2538.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731158903},{"amount":25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:04:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2538.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752246616}],"funded_date":"2015-07-22T21:43:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":919475,"name":"Radha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Radha is 58 years-old.

She invested the loan she obtained in buying cardboard, gun powder, wicks and other work materials. She made her payments on time because she had no problems with her work.

She shares her life with her husband, who works at the same business. They live in a home they own built from brick and cement with a metal sheeting roof and a wood floor. It has potable water, electricity, gas, and plumbing. Her business is making fireworks. These function as a combination of fire crackers and sparklers. Generally, they have a casing, an explosive charge, and spheres, cubes or cylinders placed around it. To light them, they have a wick. \u201cWe started my business working with my mother, because she knew the technique for several years, and to help street children.\u201d she remarks. The advantage of the business is that fireworks are very popular in public festivals. The disadvantage is a lack of capital to buy materials such as cardboard, gun powder, wicks, scissors, and more for the national festivals which are happening soon. Her dream is to sell wholesale. She wants to buy materials for pyrotechnics to make fireworks for the coming national festivals. This is her second loan cycle with the institution during the 20 years that she has been doing this activity.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons that Teresa is asking for a loan to buy material to make fireworks for the coming national festivals to help street children. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":368.28,"image":{"id":1928222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Entertainment","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials to make fireworks for the coming national festivals to help street children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-22T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-21T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-10T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":597.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":610.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":637.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":655.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":712.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T04:00:00Z","amount":733.9},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T04:00:00Z","amount":750.77},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":796.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":835.83},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T04:00:00Z","amount":858.83},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T04:00:00Z","amount":905.46},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":904.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.94},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.53},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.05},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.44},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.3},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.97,"local_amount":597.5,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-19T12:11:02Z","rounded_local_amount":606.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554927},{"amount":89.92,"local_amount":610.79,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:29Z","rounded_local_amount":619.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711469018},{"amount":93.9,"local_amount":637.81,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:00Z","rounded_local_amount":646.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296850},{"amount":96.49,"local_amount":655.42,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:34Z","rounded_local_amount":664.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752076998}],"funded_date":"2015-07-23T15:04:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":913787,"name":"Arcilia Rosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arcilia is 51 years old and lives in the town of Cerete, situated in Cordoba.

She has a university education and works as a teacher at two schools. In order to earn extra money for her family, she also breeds livestock - a business she started 20 years ago. Thanks to her persistent work Ratkan now has two cows and several sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is around 23,000 KGS. High winds destroyed the roof of the barn where the animals live, so Ratkan applied for a loan of 150,000 KGS from Bai Tushum Bank to purchase construction materials to repair the roof.

The loan that she got was invested in the purchase of a bread mixing machine. The loan payments were punctual because she had no problems. It has been more than a year since her previous loan and now she is 37 years old. Her business is in the southern area of the city, an area considered to be periurban. It was created due to a river flooding, in which more than 3000 families were left homeless, and with the few belongings that they carried away, they had to squat on some empty land to begin a new life. It has a warm sub-tropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 21-35 degrees centigrade. \r\n\r\nMartha has dark skin, brown eyes, curly black hair, is short, and has a thin physique. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks in the area and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for the business she does. She shares her life with her partner who works in the same business and with her children who go to school. They live in a rented room built of brick and cement with a roof of metal sheeting and a cement floor which has running water, electricity, and sewer services. Her business is a bakery, the most common varieties of bread are: cu\u00f1ap\u00e9 (a small roll made with yucca flour and cheese), empanada de arroz (baked with rice and cheese), zonzo (yucca puree mixed with cheese and made into a stick), bizcochos de trigo (small hard rolls of wheat flour), masaco de pl\u00e1tano (fried plantains mashed and mixed with cheese, pork or salted beef), masaco de yuca (boiled and mashed mixed with cheese or pork or salted beef), and more. \"I continue expanding my bakery. My old oven is defective and is small. The demand in the zone makes me need a new and larger oven...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that it has daily sales. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to purchase an oven with six racks.

Gulniso herself sews women's clothing. It was hard for her to learn how to do this. After graduating from secondary school, her parents were unable to give her a higher education due to financial problems, but they wanted their daughter to become independent and find her own path in life. Since she had a talent for sewing, her parents decided to send her on sewing courses, however they had few funds for this too. Having saved up the specified sum over a few months, they were able to pay for Gulniso's training. She became an excellent seamstress and began helping her parents. She continued working after getting married. Now Gulniso wants to expand her business and she needs to buy a new \"Yamata\" sewing machine for this. She needs financial support. Please help Gulniso to realize her dream.

saree, from the village Jamunda of Koraput district. She is the featured borrower of Jardan SHG-A (Self-Help Group A). She was happy with her children and her husband, a tractor driver. After 19 years of marriage, she separated from her husband due to personal reasons. At that time, she had a son aged seventeen years and a daughter aged fifteen years. She has been struggling since then to support her family.\r\n\r\nLakshmi started a snack and tea stall at her house, which is located quite close to the market. She cooks and sells local snacks and tea in the mornings and evenings, the general hours for such a business. She sells pan (betel leaf) on a small scale during the rest of the day to fill her day and increase her income. She hopes for a bright future for her children. \r\n\r\nWith the six years of experience in running the shop, Lakshmi wants to expand her business to meet customer demand.

Poultry farming is a less strenuous activity that is profitable. Many poultry farmers find a sense of fulfilment having hens all over their homestead. The hens lay eggs that can be consumed or sold. If taken seriously, poultry farming has the potential of being a big business since the demand for poultry products is always high. With your loan, Winnie is going to make more income that will enable her to take care of her family's expenses. As the times keep getting harder, Winnie is doing all she can do to ensure that her family's basic needs are met.\r\n With the loan that you make today, you will be able to improve Winnie\u2019s life and her poultry business!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":90.94,"image":{"id":1935831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry for the expansion of her farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bomet","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-23T00:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-22T00:30:05Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Winnie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.99,"local_amount":2298.6,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2357.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711507085},{"amount":20.82,"local_amount":2082.48,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2135.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023908},{"amount":47.13,"local_amount":4713.5,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4833.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112036}],"funded_date":"2015-07-23T04:42:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":919715,"name":"Antonia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Antonia is 24 years old and married with one child.

Flomena said, \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\"  Her biggest challenge, however, is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. To a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. <br \/><br \/>Because of this challenge, Flomena formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports small rural farmers.

He is a good father, enterprising, dedicated, steady, patient, responsible  and very hard working.  He is developing his business in the city neighborhood called \"El Recreo\", the area where the most growth is taking place, mostly through forest and agricultural production.  This is the most important area for production of  hydrocarbon,and is located 437 meters above sea level, with a warm sub-tropical climate, and temperature varying during the day between 21 and 34 degrees Centigrade. \r\n\r\n   Alberto  has brown skin, dark eyes,and short greying hair.  He is short, with a  stocky build.  Alberto's first language is Guarani, which is spoken in the area, and he speaks Spanish at work.  He shares his life with family members who are adult and independent.  Alberto lives in a family house built of bricks and cement, with a metal sheeting roof and cement floor.  The house has electricity, running water and a sewer system.  His business is the sale of food and items needed everyday such as bread, water, sugar, oil, noodles, floor, rice, butter, soft drinks, paper, crackers, and cleaning products in his neighborhood store daily during the week. \r\n\r\n Due to the lack of business in the area, Alberto doesn't have to worry about competition.  \"My store supplies a large part of the area; that is why I have daily, frequent sales, \" he says.  Besides his neighborhood store, Albert has a vehicle he uses to work by transporting people.  The car was financed by the bank, and the last payment to complete the loan is needed.  The advantage his store has is that sales are daily; the disadvantage is the lack of capital to supply his store and make the last loan payment for his car.  Alberto's dream is to improve his two lines of work. He wants to buy groceries and make the last payment on the car so he can continue working.  This is the first sequence of loans Alberto has sought from the organization in the 15 years he has worked at this business.

She is 30 years old. She sews clothes from home for a living. She is a single mom raising a son. Her son is seven years old. He is about to go to school.

It is what encourages Caren and fills her with enthusiasm. \r\n\r\nKaren has been practicing mixed farming for the past two years. On her farm, she grows maize, has two dairy cows, and keeps poultry. She sells milk, eggs, and maize. When she is not farming, she engages in some personal business to help supplement the income she earns. Despite her low earnings, farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction. \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" she says. \r\n\r\nCaren's biggest challenge is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. For a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Caren formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance organization that supports small rural farmers. \r\n\r\nCaren is seeking a loan to buy a dairy cow and is planning to become a full-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. With this loan, Caren is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, good health, and a good livelihood.\r\n\r\nCaren hopes to succeed thanks to the support from the kind-hearted people that support small holder farmers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":137.92,"image":{"id":1935889,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy a quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bomet","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-23T01:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-22T01:30:05Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caren","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":62400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4416.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4545.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4678.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4814.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4955.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5100.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5249.45},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5402.86},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5560.76},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5723.27},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5890.52},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6062.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.63},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.09},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.58},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.7},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.32},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.67,"local_amount":4659.51,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4785.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711507088},{"amount":43.34,"local_amount":4327.54,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4444.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023912},{"amount":47.91,"local_amount":4783.07,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4912.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112039}],"funded_date":"2015-08-18T12:20:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}}]}
