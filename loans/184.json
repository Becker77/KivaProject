Currently her child is in school. She lives at Dorma in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana. She is a petty trader who deals in assorted products like cooking utensils and plastic bowls, lunch boxes, etc. She mostly sells through hawking, that is, house to house selling. She has been in business for two years and two months now. With her humorous behavior, she has attracted lots of customers who purchase from her. She has decided to add eggs to her inventory which she supplies to food vendors in the evening.<P>\r\n\r\nConstance treks to Accra to purchase her stock of goods (cooking utensils). Recently she has been facing challenges in her business as a result of inadequate funds to buy stock.

They don't have their own boat for fishing because they can't afford to buy one. However, her husband borrows the fishing boat of their neighbor. During days when their neighbor's fishing boat is not available, Janeth has no fish to sell, hence, fishing and fish-selling don't give them regular income. \r\n\r\nFish is not the most in-demand food of people in Janeth's village, yet it is one of the foods people are buying, more than other kinds of meat. It is so because fish is cheaper and common in their place, which is situated near the ocean. Janeth wishes to have this kind of business as their stable source of income. She wants to purchase their own fishing boat to be managed by her husband, thus making fishing as regular as it can be. \r\n\r\nInitially, Janeth had started her fish-selling business after she became a member of ASHI in June 2009. Since the loan she received is not yet enough to purchase a fishing boat for her husband, she will use it to finance her fish business. With her next loan, plus the savings she could generate out of her newly started business, she will be buying her husband a fishing boat. Janeth's husband is so supportive to all her visions, including her dreams for her children. She is determined to work hard in growing her business so that she can send all of her six children to school until college. By then, she foresees their lives coming out of poverty. \r\n\r\nShe is so thankful that ASHI has the same vision as hers and that she has the opportunity to help herself and her family.

One child is married already and has 2 children.\r\n\r\nAvelina has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1997 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.

This will be her 10th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step on her journey toward economic freedom. Avelina aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and to ensure their future well being by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

single mother with a 9-year old daughter. She lives in Alba Rancho in a rural area south-east of Cochabamba with her parents and siblings. Her job is producing milk for the local processing plant. As the oldest daughter, she is responsible for her elderly parents. About five months ago her mother had an accident; she fell into a ditch after leaving the house. At the time she didn\u2019t have any pain but a month later she couldn\u2019t walk because of the pain in her hip. Sonia paid for the operation and subsequent treatment. Her mother is recovering and has already begun to walk again and take up her daily activities. To pay for the operation Sonia had to sell four cows, but she says the most important thing is her mother and to see her healthy brings her and the rest of the family much happiness. She doesn\u2019t mind having to start over again.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy soybean husks to increase milk production in her cows. She only has five now and has to work hard to make ends meet and support her daughter whom she wants to finish school and get a good job. Sonia didn\u2019t finish school as she had to work in the fields with her parents and help them with the cows. She is very hardworking and responsible.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva

Nghi\u00eam Th\u1ecb (20213020014) is a 48-year-old female living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, L. owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling herbs and spices in the local community.  L. has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, L. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  L. has successfully repaid a previous L. of 6.048.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous L. was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  L. is now requesting a new L. of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital.  This will be the fourth L. taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  L. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this L. was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nL.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, to epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Ordialyn, a jeepney driver, and is a mother to their two children. Both children already have their own families. She, together with her husband, is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAvelina oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which pays boundary (daily quota) each day. Aside from this she also manages a small variety store in her place. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 800 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new accessories and spare parts and for the maintenance of their jeepney. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAvelina hopes to add another Jeepney unit someday and hopes for a better future for her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":892704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To pay for the spare parts and maintenance of their jeepney unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-17T12:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Avelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2164.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571866},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.99,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:32:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2885.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529416},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2884.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738632},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2885.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145860}],"funded_date":"2011-10-17T12:53:44Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":349374,"name":"Areej","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Areej is a 32-year-old young woman, and she is married with two sons and two daughters.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Erkinjon is a 50-year-old farmer, married with four children. His wife is a housewife and this leaves him as sole breadwinner.\r\n\r\nErkinjon has been farming for the last thirteen years growing potatoes on his piece of land. At the same time he raises cattle. He would like to adopt new farming technology to boost his agricultural yield. He needs to be able to meet the financial responsibility of educating his younger children who are all in school and to maintain his family but he lacks the capital.\r\n\r\nErkinjon requests a 2,650 USD loan to be used for purchasing seeds and fertilizer for growing potatoes. He\u2019ll also spend part of the loan on purchasing young cattle. He is very responsible and promises to repay the loan on time.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This credit is meant for groups of 4 or more young people that promise, along with their parents, to solidify their guarantee.  These groups pay all together, along with adult associations that generally become like mentors to these young men and women.  The communal association, \"Jesus Te Ama,\" is composed of a group of 2 girls and 2 boys, who follow this plan.  In the photo, there are the two boys with caps and the two girls with a blue and a white jacket.  Omar C. Q. is the president of the group of young people.  He is 18 years old and has been a member for two loan cycles.  He has a carpentry business that he has grown by partnering with his friend 5 years ago.  Nowadays, he makes bed stands and bedside tables, which are his specialty.  With his first loan of Bs1000 (he remembers having bought wood, now that his credit is Bs2000), he hopes to buy his own work tools: a hammer, a plane, and wood, his most important commodity.  Finally, he states that what he likes most about Pro Mujer is spending time with the members of his group.    \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy Quan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":497701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"wood, hammer, plane, varnish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2010-02-27T13:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Omar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vaneza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty Nayda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5454.54,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":545.51},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":545.51},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":545.51},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":545.51},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":545.51},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":545.51},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":545.51},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":545.51},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":545.51},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":544.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.01},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.01},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.01},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.01},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.01},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.01},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.01},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80.01,"local_amount":545.51,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-17T08:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":557.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129011576},{"amount":80.01,"local_amount":545.51,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":557.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136735965},{"amount":80,"local_amount":545.51,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:05:56Z","rounded_local_amount":557.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136735966},{"amount":160.02,"local_amount":1091.02,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144769360},{"amount":160.02,"local_amount":1091.02,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151951836},{"amount":239.94,"local_amount":1635.97,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159691369}],"funded_date":"2010-02-27T22:12:43Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:55:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracy Quan","image":null}},{"id":185453,"name":"Miguel \u00c1ngel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or M. es un transportista de este municipio el cual con su cami\u00f3n se dedica a la compra y venta de sal donde la distribuye en los departamentos del sur y occidente de Nicaragua el cual con esfuerzo propio ha logrado salir adelante en su peque\u00f1o negocio  ya que con los cr\u00e9ditos anteriores con nuestra instituci\u00f3n   el logro comprar su cami\u00f3n y as\u00ed dejar de alquilar ya que antes el tenia que alquilar un cami\u00f3n para poder comercializar el producto.\nEste cr\u00e9dito lo solicita para realizarle una operaci\u00f3n que necesita la esposa de Don Miguel ya que en este instante no tenia los recursos suficientes para pagar la operaci\u00f3n.\n","en":"El se\u00f1or M. is a trucking contractor from this town.

Now after so many years, she is satisfied by the help that she has received as well as by the help her fellow members have received. She acts as secretary for the bank, she is 41 years old, and she is a single mother of two children who are 17 and 9 years old and are in primary and secondary school.\r\n\r\nShe is a sales woman, selling all types of clothes. She sells door to door and by advance order. She has a lot of customers who order her products because she gives them payment options. She collects payments on weekends which is good because when she's collecting payments she can also make additional sales. She works almost all day on the weekends with her sister's help.

She will use the loan to buy: soap, oil, toilet paper, detergent, sugar and more.\r\nHilaria decided to begin this business because her husband doesn\u2019t earn enough to cover the expenses and because her little daughter needs many things and she isn\u2019t able to buy all of them.\r\nHilaria says that before she was married, she made bread but she stopped once she met her husband.\r\nHer goal is to have her own house since now she lives with her mother-in-law and she plans to succeed with effort and dedication.\r\nShe is very happy with the loan offered and she appreciates the support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":780232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy grocieries such as detergent, toilet paper, sugar, oil, etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-06-06T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hortencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna Felisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gullermo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":434.38},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":434.37},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":434.37},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":434.38},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":434.37},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":434.38},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":434.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":434.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":868.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512744},{"amount":868.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223390},{"amount":868.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201667},{"amount":868.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807256}],"funded_date":"2011-06-14T03:32:04Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":308381,"name":"Leida Beatriz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Banco Comunal De Colorado se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en Colorado del  Cant\u00f3n Montecristi, conocido por su rica cultura pre colonial y por su artesan\u00eda, que es reconocida a nivel nacional e internacional.

This area is known for its rich pre-colonial culture and for its handicrafts.

Two of her children have passed away, and the other 4 are adults.  One of her children still lives with her.  Her husband is a driver; he has a tanker truck and a dump truck.  \r\n\r\nLeida is a very good wife who is taking a loan for her business selling gravel and water by the tankload.  Our friend tells us that in the area where she lives they don't have potable water, so her husband has an opportunity to sell this vital liquid to the people who need it.  She works Monday through Saturday from 7:30am until 6pm, and on Sundays when needed.  She tells us that her husband has been doing this work for more than 15 years, and it has gone very well since there are very few tanker trucks available to distribute water in her area. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy water and gravel.  Leida has been in her communal bank since the beginning, and she likes it because of the benefits she receives as a member.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to buy another tanker, since the one they have is a bit rundown.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":794200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Water Distribution","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy water and gravel ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-06-20T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leida Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:05:02Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216504253},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221668203},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:07:56Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227036950},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797514},{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":275.01,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":275.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238608609},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:54:02Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562930},{"amount":91.63,"local_amount":91.63,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":91.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250774017}],"funded_date":"2011-06-22T00:08:47Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:04:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":312479,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a farmer in Kisii, South Rift, Kenya.

Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil, and a ready market for horticulture products, Jane wants to take advantage of those and reap more profits. \n\nJuhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help women like Jane to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. Jane hopes that, through the loan, she will improve her living conditions. Jane\u2019s dreams and projections are that, by the end of next year, she will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. \n\nThrough this she will be able to assure her children of a secure future and uninterrupted learning because she will be able to pay tuition fees on time. \nHelp this smallholder farmer with dreams and goals to realize!

Now, because her husband is very ill and unable to get out of bed,  Ivonne has found herself responsible for maintaining the house and the family.   She needed to put into practice something she learned from her family and friends, embroidery of handicrafts which she sells from her home.  Even though it's very hard, she manages the hours needed for her work and her family.  She feels satisfied that she can maintain the family.  Her goal is to expand her shop and buy the materials needed to make her crafts.  She is requesting a loan for this and needs your kind support to help her reach her goals.  <\/p>\r\n\r\nIvonne, es una mujer multifac\u00e9tica y emprendedora, estas  cualidades son merecidas en su personalidad porque ella tiene ese gran \u00edmpetu e iniciativa para trabajar y desempe\u00f1arse plenamente en lo que le encomienden.

El tiempo muchas veces suele ser corto para, Ivonne, pero no la desanima pues ahora se ha adecuado para distribuir las horas del d\u00eda en la atenci\u00f3n de su familia y el de sus negocios. A pesar de la penosa situaci\u00f3n por la que atraviesa su familia ella se siente satisfecha de poder sostener a su familia aunque con mucho esfuerzo; su inmenso deseo es  implementar su tiendita y comprar para las dem\u00e1s actividades que realiza las materias primas necesarias para continuar con la elaboraci\u00f3n del resto de sus productos y por esta raz\u00f3n solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para cumplir con lo que se ha propuesto. Recuerda que Ivonne necesita tu desinteresado apoyo para ver sonre\u00edr pronto a su familia otra vez."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":86420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"TO BETTER STOCK HER SMALL SHOP AND BUY MATERIALS NEEDED TO CONTINUE MAKING HER HANDICRAFTS.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-11-25T01:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivonne Nilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-09T03:29:13Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":222.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-01-09T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":112810},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-02-09T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":132160},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-03-09T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":153963},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-04-09T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:42:15Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":178157},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-05-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":205566},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-06-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233003},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-07-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:48:33Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":262049},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-08-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:56:47Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":290977},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-09-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-11T07:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":321376}],"funded_date":"2007-11-25T03:29:13Z","paid_date":"2008-09-11T07:28:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":28924,"name":"Uni","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Uni A. is a 27-year-old entrepreneur who lives in Kisumu, Kenya.

She lives in a monogamous family in the Pelengana Nord neighborhood in the city of S\u00e9gou (fourth economic region of Mali). After having attempted several business for years with her adoptive mother, she decided 5 years ago to specialize in buying and selling leather shoes, women\u2019s handbags, and loaves of bread. In order to secure additional resources, she decided to turn to microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso\u2019s credit program (3 years ago) to be able to better satisfy the needs of her growing clientele. After having secured three group loans with an association in her neighborhood, she is now on her second individual loan. All of the preceding loans were properly repaid. She plans to use this loan to buy 1,000 loaves of bread, 40 handbags, and 40 pairs of shoes. She gets her handbags and shoes from Bamako (capital of the Republic of Mali) from artisans specializing in leather goods. She gets her bread from a bakery with which she has signed an exclusivity agreement. The bags and shoes are sold at home and at the big market in the city of S\u00e9gou (for cash or credit, traveling or on the spot) usually on Mondays, the market days (when sellers sell the most). Taking care of the special setup to sell bread, she sells her goods to men and women (principally villagers) who come to stock up in order to resell in their respective villages. She hopes to earn 30,000 CFA francs monthly, which will be used towards making loan payments and contributing to her family\u2019s expenses \u2013 the rest will be invested in her business. Her dream is to become an importer-exporter in the future.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sherry W., Kiva

Three members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

She is 46 years old and lives in her own home with her four children: Glenda (22 years old), Paola (19), Anais (18), and Diego (11). Her children are the driving force behind all her efforts and sacrifices. Santusa has a stall in the Santa B\u00e1rbara market in the city of Juliaca. She sells all sorts of things, but her main source of income is from selling a variety of vegetables. Her stall is one of the busiest ones in the market, since the vegetables she sells are very delicious and offered at a very affordable price. The hardest thing for Santusa is to stay in her stall all day, trying to stave off the intense frio there inside. She's been working at this for 10 years, and what she likes most is talking to her customers, which makes her long workdays more enjoyable. Santusa hopes to improve her business and be able to offer her customers a wider variety of products, and increase her income.

Chynar lives in the city of Balykchi together with her family.  Balykchi used to be included among the fast-growing cities in the republic.  Many multi-story buildings were built here, factories were operating, and the city was also known for its fishing industry.  However, recent years of economic decline did their deed.  Manufacturing stopped, and the citizens started leaving the city.  It was difficult for Chynar because she still had to raise four children.  Her husband and she decided to stay and find work in the city.  Soon, Chynar was able to get involved in retail sales at the market.  She started selling flour and livestock feed.  Chynar\u2019s husband began working as a taxi driver.  Now, they successfully continue raising their children.  The oldest daughter is in her first year of school.  The second daughter is a college student.  Their eight-year-old son already started school.  And the youngest son, who is six, is home for now.  Chynar achieved a lot during the fifteen years in her business.  Together with her husband, she was able to purchase a house in order to organize a retail outlet there.  She was also able to buy a car.  Currently, her monthly income from flour sales and livestock feed ranges from 10,000 som ($220) to 15,000 som ($340).  The oldest daughters have already grown up and actively help their mother with the sales after school.  Now, Chynar needs a loan.  She is hoping to obtain a loan in order to increase goods turnover and purchase of 10 bags of flour and 15 bags of livestock feed.  In the future, Chynar wants to expand the business and open a food market.\r\n\r\nChynar\u2019s partners in this group are:\r\n\r\nKuluypa D. is fifty-seven years old.  Her husband is retired.  Together they raised one son.  Kuluypa also stays at home and relies solely on her pension for income.  She has wanted to purchase a washing machine for a long time; however, it will take her some time to save money for this purchase.  This is why she is hoping to obtain this loan.\r\n\r\nAynabu T. is forty-three years old.  Her husband works as a driver for one company.  Aynabu has two children.  One of the sons works as an electrician.  The second one is only two years old.  Aynabu prepares \u201cbozo\u201d (a traditional drink) and sells it to stores.  She needs a loan in order to purchase a kitchen set.\r\n\r\nRoza I. is fifty-seen years old.  She is involved in animal husbandry.  She currently has one cow with a calf and seven sheep.  Roza\u2019s husband is a physics teacher at a secondary school.  Roza requested this loan in order to buy one more cow with a calf for raising.  She wants to finish building her house and, to achieve this goal, she needs to own as much livestock for sale as possible.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":479810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increasing turnover by purchasing 10 bags of flour and 15 bags of livestock feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Balykchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-01-29T22:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chynar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuluyapa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aynabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":49000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":9181},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9481},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9790},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":10109},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":10439}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.79},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.1},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":210.79,"local_amount":9181,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:46:57Z","rounded_local_amount":9322.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123957026},{"amount":217.67,"local_amount":9481,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":9627.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128989837},{"amount":224.77,"local_amount":9790,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":9941.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715647},{"amount":232.1,"local_amount":10109,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10265.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748496},{"amount":239.67,"local_amount":10439,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":10600.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931470}],"funded_date":"2010-01-30T01:35:05Z","paid_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":176905,"name":"Sokhorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sokhorn M. is 39 years old, married, and lives in Kouk Roka village, Takeo province.

Her husband\u2019s daily routine starts early in the morning, with taking the manure out of the shed, giving water to the cows and milking the cows. As any person living in a village area, she runs a small household and even though they live in the area which is known for its harsh winters, they are perfectly used to local weather conditions. \r\n\r\nAinakul is a mother of three children. All the children go to school. Her eldest son is fifteen. After school, he helps his parents look after the cattle. However, Ainakul tries not to burden her children with anything concerning housework as she believes that her children should be spared of all that to have more free time for studies. Ainakul is forty-five years old and feels herself in sufficiently good health and does not feel tiredness until evening. Now they are feeding a calf which they bought for $230. Ainakul\u2019s dream is to give her children good education, help them get on their feet and improve her family\u2019s living conditions. Her husband is currently a member of a farm and also works as a procurement manager of a high school. Now Ainakul needs a loan to buy four sheep for feeding and resale. \r\n\r\nAinakul\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nBurul S., 57, is the wife of a school worker. She has a sixteen-year-old daughter. Burul is busy with cattle that they keep at home. Burul has applied for this loan to buy more cattle. \r\n\r\nNazgul A., 34, is the wife of a computer science and math teacher. Nazgul has three little children and currently does not work as she has to look after the kids. Now they keep three calves and need a loan to buy some sheep. \r\n\r\nAibek K., 23, is married. His wife goes to college, and Aibek has to provide for both of them. Aibek works at school and wants to start a new business as an additional source of income. He hopes to obtain this loan and buy sheep for feeding. His wife will help him. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She plans to use the additional revenue generated to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":557481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Calamba Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2010-06-24T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3418.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121772}],"funded_date":"2010-06-24T05:36:13Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Reid","image":null}},{"id":214146,"name":"Vannak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Vannak N. is 56 years old and a widow with six children.

Las 4 m\u00e1quinas de videojuegos que tiene son alquiladas y se reparte las ganancias mensuales con el due\u00f1o. Como el negocio ha crecido en poco tiempo, requiere con urgencia refaccionar el patio de su casa, donde se encuentran las m\u00e1quinas, pues las imperfecciones en el piso no dejan utilizar bien los videojuegos  a sus asiduos clientes. Le gusta mucho su trabajo porque dice que es tranquilo y lo puede desarrollar desde la comodidad de su casa, y lo m\u00e1s importante es que no descuida las labores del hogar.

Every day, they combine their efforts to work and get ahead. Six months ago, Diana established a business renting video games on the patio of her home. Since then, she has obtained a steady income which has allowed her to help her husband with the household expenses. The 4 video game machines she has are rented, and the monthly earnings are shared with the owner. Because the business has grown within a short time, she urgently needs to renovate the patio of her home, where the machines are located, because the imperfections in the floor do not allow her best customers to use the games effectively. Diana likes her work very much, because she says it is pleasant work, and she can do it from the comfort of her home, and most importantly, she does not need to neglect her work within the household.

She is involved in growing rice and raising poultry to sell to generate income for the family. Her husband helps her run the business. \r\n\r\nSopheap's husband has an old motorbike that he uses to sell grilled eggs around the village. Because the old motorbike breaks down too often, Sopheap is requesting a loan of USD 500 to purchase a new motorbike so her husband can easily carry his grilled eggs to sell. By doing so, her family's finances will be improved. In the future, she would like to build a new wooden house and support her children to study until they get Bachelor

Her husbands, a carpenter by trade, does not have his own workshop and therefore lacks the income to cover household expenses.  This is the situation under which Ms. A. has set up her truck farming activities cultivating food along the banks of the river that flows along her village.  Her project is highly successful, but it needs a lot more work and financing to turn her business into a professional one, thus producing a greater benefit.  To do this, she needs substantial financial means.  And so she is requesting a loan of $650 to buy a motorized pump to facilitate the work.

Felipe requests a loan to purchase merchandise, such as sugar, flour, yerba mate, rice, noodles, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Lucas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":324543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase merchandise for his grocery store, such as sugar, flour, rice, and noodles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Paraguari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26 -57.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2009-05-27T22:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipe ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":109.09,"local_amount":545454.54,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T21:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":547090.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52959934},{"amount":54.56,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-26T09:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":273545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63177066},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:52:30Z","rounded_local_amount":273545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602558},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-17T09:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":273545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87038763},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":273545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96951237},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":273545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103793369},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":273545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110684134},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-19T08:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":273545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118078752},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:11:44Z","rounded_local_amount":273545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123914964},{"amount":54.5,"local_amount":272727.3,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":273545.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128950664}],"funded_date":"2009-05-31T19:16:49Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:03:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Lucas","image":133535}},{"id":114979,"name":"Aggrey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K.

She used to work alone, but now her daughter and others work with her so she can complete the orders in time.  She enjoys what she does because it allows her to work without neglecting her family duties.

She lives with her husband and their children in the Attbougou public housing of Sikasso, in one of the popular district of Sikasso (located in Mali's third administrative region).\r\nSince Mrs. Assetou did not have the opportunity to advance in her studies, she very rapidly familiarized herself with the trade of various items and has had for about twelve years a shop in the front of her house. There she buys and sells cigarettes, candy, matches, chewing-gum, powdered milk, tea, sugar, etc. She is very much in demand thanks to the quality of her products.\r\nTo meet demand from a growing number of customers, she decided to join micro-finance organization Soro Yiriwaso a few months ago. She thus is on her first loan, which will allow her to increase her working capital in order to better satisfy her customers.\r\nWith this first loan, she is planning on buying two cartons of cigarettes from different brands, five cartons of chewing-gum, two cartons of powdered milk (in pouches), five large packs of tea, one bag of sugar, ten cartons of candy, twenty packs of matches and a few egg cartons. She purchases her merchandise form local wholesalers before retailing it for cash or credit to a clientele composed of neighbors, and mostly of young people.\r\nWith this first loan, she is planning on a monthly profit of 100,000 FCFA, which will mainly be used to contribute to the expenses of the family and to pay her loan's interests, with the remainder to be reinvested in the business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":863412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy miscellaneous grocery items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-09-04T21:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Assetou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882138},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699235},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655504},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:38Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874295},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283121},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424627},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139909},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276756903},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251691},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410738}],"funded_date":"2011-09-10T04:13:45Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlotte Buecheler","image":566239}},{"id":337112,"name":"Maya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maya is from the village Mukhrani in the Mtskheta district.

She thanks you for your support. <P>Raising \"kuku\" is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you have probably heard the term \"kuku\" and you might be wondering who or what are \"kuku\"? In Swahili, \"kuku\" means chickens, and raising them for sale is a popular business in Tanzania for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital: you can start with just one or two kuku and either add more as your business expands or wait for them to (naturally) multiply! Second, kuku do not need a great deal of space or any special facilities so you can normally just let them run around your garden or compound. Third, kuku produce eggs while they grow, and the eggs can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. Mary is sure that there are many other reasons why raising kuku is so popular--she speculates that they may be friendlier or prettier than other animals--but she hopes you now have a better understanding of the popularity of kuku in Tanzania."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":140720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 300 additional kuku (chickens) to raise and sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-19T16:40:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-04T00:16:29Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-05-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:47Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201010},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-06-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:03Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":228152},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-07-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257240},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-08-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286001},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-09-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":316195},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-10-04T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-15T07:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347869},{"amount":99.5,"local_amount":116487.78,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:21:37Z","rounded_local_amount":117459.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347581},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":121001.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970201},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:06Z","rounded_local_amount":121001.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886451},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:26Z","rounded_local_amount":121001.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435736}],"funded_date":"2008-03-21T00:16:29Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":45343,"name":"Saribel","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Saribel is a teacher at Manteles Verdes school.

After the first successful utilization of the fund, in this round Ms. T. is applying for 375 USD to buy feed for the pigs, and also to buy a female pig (currently the price of baby pigs is very high).

Counting her husband\u2019s pension, the family\u2019s income is 150 USD\/month.

Yuryi knows his customers\u2019 preferences and always offers them only good quality groceries. He has been in the grocery trade for about 7 years. His business has been marked with consistent stability. Currently, his gross income is about 12,000 Hryvnia a month. \r\n\r\nYuryi is running a neat small grocery store. He is hoping to invest a loan of 7,000 Hryvnia in additional merchandise which will help him increase his turnover capital eventually. Yuryi has a vision for the expansion of his trade and we believe it will be helpful in his entrepreneurial endeavors. The loan will help Yuryi to persist, take small steps at a time and achieve success which we think will be absolutely inevitable.

She is 23 years old. Shela is single and has one infant-aged child. To make a living, Shela owns & operates a business in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop.  The main source of income from the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Shela has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Shela joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Shela has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Shela is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Shela from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":433659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 220 tala or US $92 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Matile joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Matile's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Matile T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.55 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

They will all use their portion of the loan for different purposes. \r\n\r\nMrs. Sarath Y. owns a general store in the local village where she sells groceries to earn a large profit to support her family. Her husband, Mr. Bou TU. Kheng, is a soldier. He is also a farmer and owns a one-hectare plot of land to grow rice to sell to support his family. Her problem is that her husband's field is infertile but she does not have enough money to address this. So, to improve production, Mrs. Sarath Y. is applying for a loan to buy fertilizer. With the rest of the loan she will hire farm laborers to grow rice. \r\n\r\nShe is the mother of four children: one is a seamstress in a garment factory, two are enrolled in the local school and the

This means of work allows her to generate income to support her family; she lives with her partner and has six children.  \r\n\r\nWhen asked why she likes working with Pro Mujer, she replies that it\u2019s because she likes the savings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":773570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"buy merchandise (plastic products).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2011-05-21T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maxima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maxima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10606.05,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":883.87},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":883.87},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":883.87},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":883.87},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":883.87},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":883.87},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":883.87},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":883.87},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":883.87},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":883.87},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":883.87},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":883.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":254.18,"local_amount":1767.74,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1769.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216576450},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":1767.74,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:27:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1769.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221746169},{"amount":254.18,"local_amount":1767.74,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:17:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1769.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227115793},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":1767.74,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1769.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232877448},{"amount":381.27,"local_amount":2651.61,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2653.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238694155},{"amount":127.03,"local_amount":883.48,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:08:05Z","rounded_local_amount":884.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244650209}],"funded_date":"2011-05-24T04:39:35Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T11:08:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":304332,"name":"Gulnara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulnara is 46, married and has two children.

They are on average 37 years old and have an average of 6 children each. For the most part they live in polygamous families in Maaro, a village located about 45 km from Sikasso, 3rd administrative district of Mali.\r\n\r\nThey are working with micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso in order to better organize their activities at the beginning of the rainy season. This is their fifth loan with Soro Yiriwaso. The previous loans were fully repaid. The crops grown by Fatouma, second from the right, standing, with a child on her back, are rice and groundnuts. With her loan, she plans to pay for plowing costs and to buy inputs and seeds for 1.5 hectares of land.

Today, he sells milk and hot milk toddies (a drink made from cinnamon, milk, rum and sugar), which he distributes from his motorcycle. \r\n\r\nHe has worked with Adim perviously, which allowed him to improve his sales, but he still needs to invest a larger sum in his business to buy milk and pinol (a corn\/cocoa-based powder used to make drinks) to later resell. For P., his greatest challenge is expanding his business. His greatest desire is to prosper and to ensure the well-being of his family. \r\n\r\nThe other group members are Mar\u00eda Teresa Z.
