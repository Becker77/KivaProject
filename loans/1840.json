She grew up with her parents and thanks to the support they gave her she was able to finish high school. Her partner went to work in another city a month ago, but he is always watching out for the family.<br \/><br \/>Maria grew up working on the farm planting basic grains with her parents. She earns a living selling drinks such as sodas, juices, and others, and she also sells pupusas on the weekends in the afternoons. She learned this thanks to a relative where she used to work, and this encouraged her. On the weekdays she sells snack foods and drinks in the school.<br \/><br \/>Maria is requesting a loan to buy sodas, juices, corn, beans, sugar, oil, and an iron to make pupusas. Right now the iron she has is leased, and if she had her own iron she would be able to sell every day of the week. Maria's dream is to  build her house out of adobe or brick since the one she currently has is made of mud, and in the winter it gets wet. She also hopes that one day she can have a cafeteria close to the school in order to have a more appropriate place to sell her products."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":129.39,"image":{"id":1928403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is already 57 years old now and has three children. One of them was a special child, and she's praying for a longer life for this kid. She loves her children so much, and she really wishes for their success. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she has been managing her sari-sari (variety) store business at Pasay City. She started this trade five years ago and in 2010, she was introduced to CCT. Being a new member, she was highly motivated to improve her business more through the word of God that they study every week. As of now, she is working persistently to provide for the daily needs of her household. \r\n\r\nA sari-sari store is often seen everywhere in the Philippines, most especially along the sidewalks and streets. It is most likely a convenience store, but sort of smaller than the usual and offers only limited products that are commonly needed such as toiletries, food, instants, beverages and other commodities. Unlike grocery stores, sari-sari stores offer products at a low cost and in a retail basis, which is really an advantage for the customers. At some points, customers can also have credits. But this sometimes becomes a difficulty for Rosalina, especially when debts are not paid. \r\n\r\nMaking headway to improve her sales, Rosalina would like to ask for help from you. She likes to borrow a loan worth PHP 20,000 that she would use to purchase additional products and merchandise items for her store. With this, she expects to grow her sales and provide a better remedy for her family\u2019s daily living conditions. And, today, you can be a big part of her life. \r\n\r\nShe meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":281.25,"image":{"id":1935484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional products and merchandise items for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-23T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-22T03:40:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":833.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1698.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523698},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.32,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3396.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434138},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":4166.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4245.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955057},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.32,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3396.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044902}],"funded_date":"2015-07-23T10:09:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":919720,"name":"Conchita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Conchita is a married woman with three children.

She also sells mangoes, apples, citrus fruits and other Filipino fruit staples.  Through this, her family is able to earn a living. <br \/><br \/>Genara is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan to purchase more varieties of fruit to sell. She will use her loan to improve her sales and part of it will be used to support the general daily living condition of the family. <br \/><br \/>In the future, Genara hopes for more customers and increased sales. She also dreams of  business expansion and prays for job opportunities for her children. Genara meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

sewing machine and she is very happy with her purchase.  Her new machine works beautifully, and the time that Hafiza spends sewing gives her great pleasure.  The quality of her work has improved and she now has more customers.  Hafiza's income and activity have also increased, and her family's financial situation has improved.  Hafiza is very thankful for your support.<br \/><br \/>Hafiza is once again taking a loan to improve her business.  Since she now has more customers, she has used all the fabrics that she had.

In addition to this, they live in a village known for the best black mulberry alcohol drink, yet they own no land like the majority of villagers. However, they found a way to make an income about five years ago by starting to operate a little cafe as seen in the photograph.

They organized to look for common objectives, since it is easier to access a loan as a group instead of individually, because they lack the warranties to access such loan. All members have experience in the activities they carry out or the ones they want to start. They work without neglecting their families. Most of them work their businesses with their life partners or husbands, since employment sources in this area are minimal. Therefore, their businesses are their main income source of their households. Edelmira is the group leader. She is a 45 year old woman, married and mother of many children. Currently, only the two young ones who attend elementary school depend of her. Her husband works, and the salary he earns is little to support their household. This is a financing opportunity for her to strengthen her grocery store and to obtain better income, and help in this way in her household to pay for some personal expenses. Some of these women's objectives are to progress and improve their life conditions and those of their families. Six more members will work with Edelmira. They will invest the loan in commercial and small livestock activities such as raising chickens and pigs for future sale.

But Namita wants to educate their children at any cost. \r\n\r\nHer only son, Sudeb, 20 years old, is a student of B.A. in his first year in Sukanta Mahabidyalay. He is a boy with average merit but is attentive and interested in studies. He wants to enroll in a Business Management course after his graduation to get a good job. But he cannot get the necessary educational supplies and private tuition because of his parent's poor financial resources.\r\n\r\nNamita heard about BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) and has taken a loan from them. She plans to invest the entire loan to purchase study materials, pay tuition fees and college fees for her son. She hopes it will help her son to get an uninterrupted education and reach his goal.\r\n\r\nNamita and Sudeb (in the picture) are thankful to BJS and Kiva for this loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1935999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to cover the education costs of her son for his graduation degree.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2015-07-23T14:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-22T14:00:04Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Namita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-07-23T15:17:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":919703,"name":"Kukataa Unyonge Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luhanga's (far left) last loan was $250 from Wezesha Project in the town of Uvira, Democratic Republic Of Congo.

She has now been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years and has managed to earn a decent income. Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nShe passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated, \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d Her hobby is milking her cow. She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet it. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This extra production will immediately translate to more profit margins and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used to repay the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. \r\n\r\nPaulina is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future, she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling it and she also plans to start selling dairy products such as cream.

He owns a small inherited piece of land. On the land, he has kept dairy cattle and grown vegetables for seven years. His main income sources are milk and crops. He recently ventured into a small side business to supplement the meager income he earns from mixed farming. \r\n\r\nFrom Kiva lenders, Edwin is seeking a loan worth 40,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy seeds and grow his horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. It is to support horticulture farmers that Juhudi Kilimo has teamed up with Kiva to help Edwin access to a loan facility that will aid him to grow his horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With the loan, Edwin\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability.\r\n\r\nEdwin, like many entrepreneurs, hopes with the help of Juhudi Kilimo and the lenders of KIVA he will achieve his dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":62.06,"image":{"id":1936145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-23T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-22T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2016-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2016-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.31},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.06,"local_amount":6205.57,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":6363.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023923}],"funded_date":"2015-08-19T16:37:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":919929,"name":"Belita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Belita is 31 years old, married to Zablon, and supports two children.

Travelling will be an advance ,especially on my processes of learning new things ,working in the city of Sydney, will be my dream come true, because more and most business are attracted to Sydney these days.\r\n\r\n3.\tTell us about your background. Where were you born? Do you have brothers and sisters? What do your parents do for work? Are you married; do you have children?\r\nI was born on the 15th October 1990, in the city of Bujumbura Burundi\u2019s capital city, located in the eastern African countries currently staying in the city of Johannesburg, trying to persuade a BBA degree with Maharishi Invincibility Institute, through distance learning system with Maharishi University of Management. I am the last born from a family of 6 children. I lost my father in the civil war, whereby the rest of the family ran the country and find ourselves in South Africa, apparently in the city of Cape Town. As a young one in the family I believed that education is the key to development and success of my community and country as a whole. I finished secondary school in 2011 right here in South Africa, being a foreigner student, graduate with Renesys Business School in 2015 for a higher certificate in business management and currently busy with BBA degree with MI.\r\n\r\n4.\tWhat do you like to do in your spare time?\r\nIn my spare time, most of things that I usually do are reading, do some researches in different topics such as business opportunities, watching news and attend the gym sessions.\r\n\r\n5.\tHow will Kiva loan change your life? Describe how the loan will affect your studies and your lifestyle: will there be significant changes?\r\nWith this loan, this will help me in case of my tuition fees, basic needs such as transport fees, and many more. The significant changes are that I won\u2019t probably be late at school, and I won\u2019t have any excuses of not attending class programs. I will benefit more as my academics performance will be up to the standard and excellence."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1936144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for one year tuition fees and living expenses at the Maharishi Institute.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

Since then, their farm and family have grown in more ways than one. \r\n\r\nToday, they are making money from the poultry and dairy animals they raise, and also the maize and vegetables they grow. William has further invested in a side business. \r\n\r\nWilliam loves to dairy farm, it was always his goal to be a farmer. His wife understands this, and together they joined hearts and hands to make the farm's success to date happen. \r\n\r\nWilliam is seeking a loan to purchase a pedigree dairy cow. There are more than 100 cattle breeds in Kenya, however, very few are good producers of milk. The tastes and preferences for milk in the market are really growing in diversity in Kenya. Drinking milk is no longer a matter of pouring it into our cereal bowl, adding it to our coffee, or drinking it straight from the glass. We now have preferences in the type of milk we drink. Today, milk consumers have many choices. In the market we have old-fashioned cow\u2019s milk and lactose-free milk, not to mention non-dairy options such as soy, almond, rice, and coconut milk. It takes dairy masters like William to pick up on these shifts in the market, and adopt ingenious techniques in farming to ensure that their product quality adapts to the changes in consumer preference. \r\n\r\nHis desire to purchase a pedigree cow shows that William is keen on controlling the quality level in his dairy cattle. He considers breeding to be the core of his overall strategy of ensuring that milk quantity is way above average, and his milk quality is second to none in the market. \r\n\r\nWilliam anticipates that feeding will be his highest cost of milk production. This is acceptable to him because in order to get his cows to milk well and remain healthy, they must be fed properly. \r\n\r\nYour loan will make a significant difference to William's farm profitability. He and his wife will make use of the returns from this investment to pay for the loan, and to pay for their children\u2019s education. The rest will be reinvested in the business. It has always been their ambition to share their passion about farming with their children. They hope their kids will be thrilled to join the business of running the family farm."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1936180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a pedigree cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bomet","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-23T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-22T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":31200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2208.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2272.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2339.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2407.42},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2477.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2550.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2624.72},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2701.43},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2780.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2861.63},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2945.26},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3031.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.37},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.34},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.96},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sue Tritt","image":null}},{"id":919953,"name":"Duncan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Duncan is 29 years old, married, and blessed with 2 children.

Meet Gladys, an ever-smiling young farmer who is responsible and has had to overcome many difficulties through her life. However, she has always found the strength to move forward and to keep growing in her life. She has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture. She is the proud owner of a small parcel of land, on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past two years. Her primary sources of income are selling eggs and milk. Through this venture she has earned a decent income. She also engages in personal business in order to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nGladys is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to buy seeds that she will use in planting.

The area where she lives does not have access to proper water resources.They have to depend upon the river water, which is highly polluted, and most of the people in that area are affected by water borne diseases. So in order to protect herself and her family, Phulamani, along with her group member Pramala, is requesting a loan of 36,000 INR. With the loan amount she will purchase water pipes in order to facilitate water supply and install a hand pump so that she will not have to depend upon the dirty river water anymore.\r\n\r\nShe aspires to renovate the roof of her house in the near future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1936015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to install a water pump and purchase water pipes in order to facilitate the supply of clean water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Jeypore, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2015-07-23T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-22T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phulamani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pramala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":36000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-07-23T20:41:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":915891,"name":"Karla Yesenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Karla, Tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en uni\u00f3n libre con su esposo con quien tiene un hijo, y reside en el municipio de Quimist\u00e1n, Santa B\u00e1rbara.

She has been promoted into grade 10 but got very poor marks because  she didn't have the help of a private tutor nor was she provided with enough study materials.  But Nargis wants to continue her studies to do well in the forthcoming Secondary Board exam. For this, she has to take good private tuition, and she needs books and other study materials which are not affordable by her parents from their present income. The education of Jamila's daughter is now a financial burden. Hence Jamila applied for a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BJS. \r\n\r\nWith the loan Jamila will pay the tuition fees, school fees, and will purchase textbooks for her daughter.

But William, who is a small farmer from the Bomet area of Kenya, opted to become a full-time farmer. He decided that he would be independent and contribute to his community by practicing mixed farming. \r\n\r\nWilliam is blessed with five lovely children whom he refers to as his \"heartbeats.\u201d His primary sources of income are dairy and poultry farming, as well as some personal business that he does to supplement his meager income. \r\n\r\nDeciding to practice poultry farming for William was not difficult. He saw his parents raise poultry since he was young. For the past 30 years, William has been earning a decent income from poultry farming. However, the demand is overwhelming and he wants to increase his poultry. However, the biggest challenge is a lack of funds. He is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. \r\n\r\nPoultry farming has become one of the most important aspects of agriculture in Kenya because it creates business opportunities for entrepreneurs.

The above picture presents Josephine, a small-scale farmer who lives in the remote village of Mukuuni in the Chuka area of Kenya. She is happily married and is blessed with four lovely angelic-looking children. \r\n\r\nFor the last twenty years, Josephine has been engaged in mixed farming and has never looked back; she really likes what she does. Her primary sources of income have been sales of milk, eggs and crops as well as some personal business in which she engages to make ends meet. Josephine finds farming very fulfilling and agrees with the notion that farming is a very profitable business venture. However, she constantly faces the challenge of poor productivity on her farm owing to a lack of farm inputs. She is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs such as quality seeds and fertilizer that will increase her production levels, which will immediately translate into increased income levels. \r\n\r\nJosephine is a very hard-working woman who believes that, through hard work and honest sweat, her living conditions will permanently change. She will use the extra income she will receive to repay the loan and increase her farming

She is a very honest, responsible and kind woman. She has raised four children with love and patience. She had to move away to Russia in 2006 due to family problems. She worked there for over eight years. Two years ago her husband died due to illness. Two sons have gone to earn money in Russia, but their earnings are only just enough to support the family, and she needs to finish the house that was built a year ago. Due to the hot weather, she must buy a refrigerator and vinyl windows and doors for the new house in order to keep produce fresh. She will buy all the essentials with the money she receives. In future, Safiya dreams of becoming a businesswoman despite her age.

Tuti used to work as a secondary school teacher and taught children history, but she was not able to continue working in the school because her health did not allow it. She is a very energetic woman and so she cannot sit with idle hands. Her husband Mirza works as a carpenter and her son grows crops.\r\n\r\nShe started keeping cattle at home and looking after them in order to help her husband and son. She fattens the cattle, and her husband and son resell them. Using these funds, she will double her herd of livestock. This year her son began growing livestock feed. Tuti will save money on feed because of this since she and her son live in the same place and they have shared income and expenses. This is why Tuti would like to increase the size of her herd of livestock. But the money they have saved is not enough to buy new heads of cattle, and the money that her husband earns is only enough to support the family. With this aim she has applied to MDO Arvand for a loan. She will buy some cattle with the loan she receives and will increase the scale of her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50.02,"image":{"id":1932351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy some cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-07-23T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-22T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tuti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":151.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":156.63},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":160.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":168},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":169.14},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":181.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":187.84},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":190.4},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200.96},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":207.42},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":226.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.57},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.45},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.3},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.94},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.66},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.71},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.57,"local_amount":151.2,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":153.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731040487},{"amount":25.45,"local_amount":156.63,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":159.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755520159}],"funded_date":"2015-07-30T06:38:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":919884,"name":"Alpana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alpana is a 38-year-old rural woman from a small village called Kalirhat in Dhupguri.

After completing nine years of schooling, Holdorali found work on a farm in order to help his parents. Holdorali is a hard-working man, and has never complained about his work and never asked his parents for money. Indeed he has always instead helped them and raised his younger brothers and sisters. Now he is already old but he still keeps working hard. He rears animals. He has five cows and ten sheep in his herd. His wife milks the cows and takes the milk to market. Holdorali also buys and sells livestock.\r\n\r\nHoldorali has applied to MDO Arvand for financial support. He wants to expand his business and to buy a cow and a sheep, but he does not have all the money needed. For this reason Holdorali hopes that he will be given the necessary sum.

She lives with her partner and has 2 children, aged 1 and 9.  Her business is the sale of beef.  She is a good mother, and an entrepreneur.  She is independent, dependable, generous, attentive, responsible and a very hard worker.  Her business is in the community of  \"Cotoca\" which is known for its ceramic handicrafts and traditional foods.  Jelly is also made there along with a wide variety of typical baked goods.  It has a subtropical, very humid climate, with temperatures ranging between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nPatricia has a brown complexion, brown eyes, and long brown hair that she keeps tied.  She is short with a strong physical build.  Her maternal language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks at home.  She speaks Spanish for every day use and to conduct business.  (She is standing, first from the right, dressed in green pants and a horizontal striped shirt.)  She lives with her partner who works in the sale of vegetables.  They live in a house that belongs to the family, made of adobe, wood and cement, with a roof of corrugated metal sheets and a cement floor.  They obtain well water via a pump and have electricity but no sewage system.  \r\n\r\nThe postnatal costs associated with her younger child spurred her to form a bank of persons to seek loans and improve their businesses.  It is comprised of businesses such as tire sales, sales of fried chicken, sales of second hand clothes, handicrafts from cloth, a locksmith, sales of traditional baked goods, sales of milk, and making straw hats.  Patricia's business is the sale of beef.  She goes daily to the municipal slaughterhouse where she buys meat wholesale and takes it to her stand to sell at retail.  The top sellers are steak, cubed beef, beef tenderloin, round steak, fillet, marrow bones, chuck steak, rib steak, top ground and regular ground.  \r\n\r\n\u201cI sell meet to individual clients and to meat stands.  The disadvantage I have is the lack of a refrigerator to refrigerate the meat,\" she comments.  The advantage of her business is that she relies on daily sales.

She has defied the notion among her friends that farming is an old-fashioned way of earning a living. Her primary sources of income are milk and planting different varieties of crops. \r\n\r\nCatharina hails from Kapsowar, Kenya, an area that enjoys favorable weather patterns and this boosts crop production in the area. Catharina wants to diversify and start sheep farming. Kapsowar area has a ready market for sheep meat (mutton) and wool, hence she will not have a need to go and look for a market. \r\n\r\nBeing a hardworking mother, Catharina has always ensured that she puts food on the table for her family.

Not visible in the photo is rice, the staple food of Filipinos, which she sells by the kilo.  Many Filipinos buy rice good for 1-2 days family meals.  And, like most sari-sari store entrepreneurs, Mercedes also sells electronic cellphone load.  In the Philippines, almost every household owns at least one cellphone unit which they usually re-load everyday. \r\n\r\nMercedes has been in the business for 10 years, earning an average of PhP60,000 per month.  She firmly believes that she can earn more if she could add more commodities in her store, particularly rice.  A loan of PhP29,000 will go a long way to buy additional volumes of these products to expand her business.\r\n\r\nMercedes dreams of having a good life and works hard to reach this dream.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.  Through the fellowship, she draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.  *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The tank will hold 450 liters of water, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. Installing a water filtration system will save the school money in the long term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The school will repay its loan through its school fees, which it collects each term.\r\n<p>\r\nJonathan ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children who fall sick from water-borne diseases. This change will mean more students will be able to come to school.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":115.64,"image":{"id":1936188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mbale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.064444 34.179444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-07-23T21:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-22T21:40:08Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nkoma School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3035000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":35,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379400},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":379400},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":379400},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379400},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":379400},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":379400},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379400},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":379200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.64},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.64},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":115.64,"local_amount":379400,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":383893.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755507249}],"funded_date":"2015-07-24T00:21:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Pierce","image":518671}},{"id":920195,"name":"Cheng Leang's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cheng Leang lives in a rural area of the Kampong Cham province, is 46 years old.

activity of the populace. His main source of income is milk. Jasper aspires to grow his business, make better income and take good care of his wife and children.\n\nOne way that Jasper can improve his business is by ensuring his cows are more productive. He is seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter, which is a machine that chops hay into chaff. Cows enjoy feeding on chaff because it is fodder that is evenly cut, free of dust, and of good color. The chaff-cutting machine will also make it easier for him to handle fodder in bulk. \n\nThrough your loan investment, Jasper will improve feed management on his farm and that will lead increase in milk production. Jasper can also make additional income by starting up his own chaff cutting operation for other farmers. This investment will not only change Jasper's business trajectory but also improve his family's livelihood.

Previous loans have helped her to renovate old house and now she has a better house to stay than before. \r\n\r\nPresently, she is leading a group of four members to apply for a new Kiva loan.

and has four children. Zura has secondary education. She sells vegetables and fruit at the market, and also is engaged in farming. Zura has five cows and 25 sheep. On 1.0 hectare of land, she cultivates corn and clover for sales.

Her business is selling second-hand shoes. She is a good mother, motivated, independent, persevering, responsible and very hardworking. \r\n\r\nShe conducts her business in the 'plan 3000' zone, characterized by the multiculturalism of its inhabitants who are mostly Aymar\u00e1, Quechua and Guaran\u00ed. Situated in the southern part of the city, the area has a warm, sub tropical climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 21-35 degrees centigrade. Migrants settled there and formed a constantly growing commercial sector.\r\n\r\nGriselda has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long, straight dark hair, a short stature and a robust build. Her first language is Guaran\u00ed, which is spoken in her area, and she speaks Spanish as part of her general knowledge and for her business. \r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her son who studies in school. They live in a room made of wood with a corrugated iron roof and a cement floor. It has potable water, electricity and a sewage system. \r\n\r\nThe need to reach her goals led her to be the current leader of the bank of people -- with business like the neighborhood store, the butcher shop, sandwich sales, plaster crafts, refreshment sales, a bookstore and second-hand clothing sales -- to request loans and improve their businesses.\r\n\r\nHer business is second-hand shoe sales as a street vendor. Each day, she and her son go to different markets and fairs, loaded with sacks full of merchandise. They put up a couple umbrellas and a stall. Clients walk by and continually buy her items. \"The prices we offer are much lower than new footwear, so sales are good in the market,\" she says.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that the price of her footwear is very competitive. The disadvantage is the lack of investment capital and competition. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to open a big shoe store.

He is a pig farmer and paid worker who is living in a rural area located in Battambang province. Thorn has been involved in his current business for five years and he is able to earn about 23,000 KHR per day to support his family\u2019s needs. After spending money on his family\u2019s daily expenses, he could save about 13,000 KHR each day for emergency needs. \r\n\r\nGetting a small income is a main challenge for him to expand his business. Because of this, he is now leading a small group of two to apply for a new loan via VisionFund to buy more piglets and pig feeds and to build a pig cage to support his pig business and generate more income.

He is a good student and scores well in his exams in spite of his adverse situation at home. At present, the problem arises when his father, being a farmer, is unable to cover his educational expenses. Chattar did not take any outside help for his studies before, but now he needs some private tuition, reference books, notes, etc., for his coming examinations. Laili is helpless to manage the household expenses, yet she is unable to handle the educational expenses also. This creates a great pressure on her mind. <br \/><br \/>For that reason, Laili took a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to buy her son's school uniform, study materials, and for school fees as well as private tuition fees.
