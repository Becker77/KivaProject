She lives with her partner and has two daughters, ages 2 and 6. Her business is selling food. \r\nShe is a good mother, entrepreneurial, active, persevering, optimistic and very hardworking.  Her business is in the stadium of the city, that has a capacity of 30,000 seated spectators and hosts sports and musical spectaculars. There are mlid temperatures throughout the year, in the range of 18-27 degrees celsius.   \r\nMiriam has a brown complexion, brown eyes, and long black hair, which she wears tied back in a ponytail. She is short and physically strong. Her mother tongue is Quechua, which is spoken in the home and she speaks Spanish outside the home and for business. In the photo she is seated second from the right and is wearing a green sweater.   \r\nShe shares her life with her partner who workers as a salaried driver. They live in a house owned by the family and made of adobe, bricks and cement with an iron roof and a dirt floor. The home has electricity and well water, which is drawn out by an electric pump, but it does not have a sewage system.  \r\nHer need for self-improvement led her to form a bank of people to request a loan and improve her activities. The members of the bank develop activities such as: knitting wool sweaters, selling natural medicine, plaster artwork, selling food, selling second-hand clothing, repairing cellphones and selling dairy products.\r\nMiriam's business is selling sandwiches, such as the \"tranca pecho\", which is a very popular food that is made with rice, french fries, salad, sillpancho (beef flattened to be pulled), all inside bread. This is the activity that she does everyday of the week in her foodstand, which is on the outside of the sports field. The majority of her customers are spectators of the sports events like soccer and others. \r\nMiriam comments that \"Everything that is in this dish, including the rice, is incorporated in the tortilla bread that is also typical of this city.\"\r\nThe advantage of her business is that the food that she prepares is very popular, the disadvantage is that she does not have sufficient finances to buy the ingredients such as rice, beef, bread, etc. She wants to buy the ingredients to prepare \"tranca pecho\" and please the sports fans. This is the first sequence of loans in the 15 years that she has been working in this business. \r\nFor these reasons Miriam is requesting a loan, to buy the cooking ingredients to prepare \"tranca pecho\" and feed the sports fans.\r\nHer dream is to open a popular restaurant.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":1929262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy the cooking ingredients to prepare \"tranca pecho\" and feed the sports fans.

She is a widow bringing up four children on her own. Because of health issues, she started receiving a state pension early. She lives in a small village. As a child Oyguna had dreamed to become a teacher, but the circumstances were such that she was not able to attend college due to her family's financial insecurity.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a reliable source of income, Oyguna raises livestock, and then sells meat and milk. She earns a decent income, sufficient for a modest life. At present she still does not have enough means to cover all the necessary expenses. At present she would like to renovate her cattle shed and stock up fodder for winter. This is why she has applied to Arvand for a loan. Oyguna thanks Arvand in advance for its support, which will lead to an improvement of her family's quality of life.

But she's really hopeful that she'll be successful with this. \r\n\r\nToday, she asks for your helping hands for the continuation of her inventory. She would like to take a loan worth PHP 10,000 that she will use in buying greater quantities of clothes to sell. If she gains such, it would be an advantage, since people get more attracted when there are more clothes displayed than the usual. \r\n\r\nShe really hopes that you can help her with this. She is doing this for her family, and she wants to experience business expansion. Her remaining hope relies in you. So far, she's praying that her family will always stay strong, united and kept in harmony. \r\n\r\nAs of today, she's active in attending a weekly fellowship* that enables her to draw strength and inspiration to push towards the goal through the word of God that she studies with her colleagues. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She sells different kinds of products like plastic pitchers, strainers, hangers, etc. The profit she gets from the business becomes a great help for their family, basically in terms of their daily expenses. \r\n\r\nLydia is a typical mother with a typical dream. She just wants to expand her business and earn enough, for there is nothing more that she hopes, aside from her child to gain a better quality of education and then have a college degree. \r\n\r\nIt's the reason why she wants to further improve her resources. If you would allow it, she wants to ask for an 8,000 PHP loan, which she will use for buying more plastic products to sell. With this loan, she can surely gain more income, and part of what she will gain, she will save for future investments, and part will be used for their everyday living.  \r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll be a great blessing in advance. Thanks for your heartfelt generosity and goodness. \r\n\r\nLydia meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

their craftsmanship globally. Mela works closely with artisans who create high-quality products, promoting social uplift in their communities. \n\nSonali had traveled frequently to India as a child to visit her grandmother, volunteer, and explore the country. She was amazed by the the sheer number of regional crafts, which were unique and beautiful but the artisans who made them were struggling. No longer able to earn a living wage because of the lack of local markets for their work, an increasing number of master craftsmen were being forced to give up their craft in exchange for a life of abject poverty as unskilled workers just to survive. These concerns became a call to action, leading to a collaboration between father and daughter. \n\nAt 23, Sonali started the venture, Mela Artisans. After having studied human rights and traveled extensively in India, she felt that she needed to do something to make a change. Working in the social sector, she saw that a business was the solution. That\u2019s why she focused on connecting markets, thereby making the artisans themselves self-sufficient. Since 2012, Sonali has placed orders with more 50 artisans groups across 10 states, and more than three-fourths are with women. Sonali hopes that this with loan, they can further their reach and support more artisans by expanding their current product line to include embroidered pillows. This will require additional training and new materials which will be covered by this loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1937858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Expanding the current line of artisan products to include embroidered pillows and increase jobs for artisans in India.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Mumbai","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":412,"posted_date":"2015-07-24T05:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-23T05:40:05Z","loan_amount":5625,"lender_count":144,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5625,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-07-24T14:07:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":915983,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":146.17,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To pay university fees.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2015-07-24T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-23T05:50:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":3112046,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":239959},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":242092},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":245794},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":248375},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":255455},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":258181},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":260401},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":265853},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":270327},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":272971},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":278097},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":274541}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.85},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.3},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.39},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.29},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.82},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.85},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":96.81,"local_amount":482051,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":499208.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711478932},{"amount":49.36,"local_amount":245794,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":254542.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752085045}],"funded_date":"2015-07-24T06:27:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":920202,"name":"Riza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Riza is a single woman with two children.

She is married and has two children. She lives in a small rural village. Since her childhood, Nigora has dreamed of becoming a teacher, but due to the way circumstances turned out, she was unable to get a university education because her family didn't have the finances. Immediately after graduating secondary school, Nigora got married, and so she became a housewife. However, even though she's constantly at home, Nigora is never idle. She and her husband try to do everything possible to provide their children with all they require. \r\n\r\nIn order to have a steady stream of income for their sustenance, Nigora and her husband began their own business. They practice animal husbandry. Nigora raises livestock, and then sells the meat and milk she gets from the livestock. Nigora gets a good profit from this business. Nigora's husband also works on a farm. His work brings in additional income for the family. Their combined incomes are enough to afford an average residence.

This is why Wilma needs a loan so that she can expand her business and generate more income to benefit her family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1929736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy embroidery equipment to improve her sales. \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2015-07-24T09:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-23T09:40:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2017-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2017-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2017-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2017-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2017-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2017-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.24},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":208.42,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:04:51Z","rounded_local_amount":215.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696529549},{"amount":31.3,"local_amount":208.65,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":215.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711441288},{"amount":31.31,"local_amount":208.76,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":215.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730962270},{"amount":31.14,"local_amount":207.88,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":214.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752051358}],"funded_date":"2015-07-24T15:21:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Donna Davison","image":null}},{"id":920245,"name":"Janela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janela is 53 years old and married with six children.\r\n\r\nShe is in an agricultural business, pig fattening in the Philippines.

Her mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1 which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish in general culture and to do business.\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her partner who works in transport and with their children who study in school. They live in a rented room built with bricks and mortar, with a corrugated iron roof and wooden floor. They have drinking water, electricity, gas and sewerage. \r\n\r\nAt the moment her business is running correctly, she makes sales every day and her business hours are quite flexible. \"I work arduously in my business. I attend to my clients with kindness as I want to keep doing this job for many years...\" she says. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she has sales every day. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to keep restocking her business supplies. Her dream is to grow her business. She hopes to be able to buy staple items and food such as: sugar, rice, oil, noodles etc. to stock the shelves of her business. This loan is her second loan sequence with the institution in 5 years that she is using for this business.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Rosario is asking for a loan to buy food and staple items to stock her neighbourhood convenience store to help with her family's expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1929788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy convenience food and staple items to stock her small neighbourhood store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-24T11:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-23T11:00:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-11T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-15T04:00:00Z","amount":267.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T04:00:00Z","amount":284.63},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T04:00:00Z","amount":311.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T04:00:00Z","amount":321.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T04:00:00Z","amount":330.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T04:00:00Z","amount":351.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T04:00:00Z","amount":362.61},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T04:00:00Z","amount":378.53},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T04:00:00Z","amount":391.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.18},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.71},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.39},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.78},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":82.87,"local_amount":552.48,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":570.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711469028},{"amount":367.13,"local_amount":2447.52,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2529.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296860}],"funded_date":"2015-08-17T17:31:43Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Donna Davison","image":null}},{"id":919738,"name":"Prince","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Prince is 24 years old, married and supports a family of one children.

She also prepares dishes for working people who wants to buy cooked food either to eat at her stall or take them home to their families to save time and money especially for a family of two or three members only. \r\n\r\nLourdes would like to request for a Php 50000 loan to buy large quantities of grocery items to add to her store and buy ingredients like chicken, pork, veggies, seasonings, gas needed to cook dishes for her food stall. She believes it will help grow her business  and thus meet their daily needs and assist her children's schooling.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that someday her small eatery could grow into a restaurant. She wants both her children to finish college.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":796.9,"image":{"id":1936714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for groceries like canned goods, instant noodles, coffee, eggs, beverages for her store and cooking ingredients as well needed for her food stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"General Trias, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-24T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-23T11:50:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375.04,"local_amount":16666.64,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:58Z","rounded_local_amount":16981.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434154},{"amount":187.51,"local_amount":8333.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":8490.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955073},{"amount":234.35,"local_amount":10416.65,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":10613.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044918}],"funded_date":"2015-08-16T13:43:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":920372,"name":"Josefina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josefina is 60 years old and has seven children.

It has potable water, electricity, gas and plumbing. Her business is selling broaster chicken (seasoned chicken fried in oil). She does this activity Monday through Sunday in a rented room with a kitchen.

This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 5 years that she has been developing this activity. \r\n\r\nThis is why Nancy is asking for a loan to buy a fryer to continue with her business and help her son go to school.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":242.28,"image":{"id":1929795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a fryer for her business and help her son go to school.

She always takes advantage of this season to fill her stand with more stock and boost her earnings, so that she can continue to pay for her daughters' education.

He earns his living making and selling ice cream. He is a good father--positive, solid, patient, responsible and very hardworking. He works in the Santiago de la Caya area in a part of the town known for its steep sloping streets. The climate is cold and dry with a daily temperature that varies between 0 and 12C. \r\n\r\nRodrigo is dark skinned with brown eyes and short black hair. He is short and slender. His mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1 which he uses at home, but he also speaks Spanish for cultural and business purposes. His son lives with him and is doing his military service. They live in their own home built of adobe with a corrugated sheet roof. It has electricity, drinking water, and a sewage system.\r\n\r\nRodrigo learnt how to make ice cream from his parents. He started his business with a small amount of capital, but as time went by his customer base grew and more ice cream was ordered. His son helps him with the business at weekends as the rest of the time he is in the barracks. In the future he wants to follow in his father's footsteps.\r\n\r\nRodrigo's regular customers are schools, colleges, and universities. One advantage of his business is that he has contracts in place, but a disadvantage is his lack of capital to buy a motorcycle to distribute the ice cream. His dream is for his son to take over the business and hire staff.\r\n\r\nRodrigo is seeking a loan to buy a motorcycle for delivering  his ice cream orders. This is his first loan with the institution in the 15 years he has had his business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1930826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She runs her  business in a very well-know market in the centre of the city; one of the most traditional ones where all types of products can be found, such as: vegetables, fruits and groceries.It has several outside streets with a variety of stalls the sellers attend gently, with a lot of care. It is a cold and dry climate with temperatures that vary by 0-12 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n\r\nDelia has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair that she wears plaited, short stature and robust physique. She wears crowns on her teeth and her usual style of dress is traditional (sombrero, blanket and \"pollera\" which is a traditional skirt). Her mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1 which she speaks with her family and she speaks Spanish culturally and to do business (she goes to the centre to feed her baby). \r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her partner who works in transport and with her daughters who study at school.

They live in a rented room built with bricks and mortar, with a tin roof and wooden floor, that has drinking water, electricity, gas and sewerage. \r\n\r\nAs she needs to pay the postnatal costs of her newborn daughter, to ask for a loan and improve her business, she started a group of people with businesses such as; selling potatoes, selling second-hand clothing, construction services, plaster craftwork, selling Salte\u00f1as (savoury pastries), selling eggs, selling supplies and selling food. Delia's business is selling vegetables, such as; tomatoes, carrots, squashes, broccoli, lettuce etc. She sells them from a permanent open-air stall every day of the week. \"I learned the trade from my mother, I have spent all my life selling vegetables...\" she says.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she has regular clients. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy wholesale vegetables. Her dream is to have a car to take her from her home to her stall.

She lives with her partner and she has two children, ages five and eight. Her business is selling second-hand clothing. She is a good mother, kind, optimistic, patient, sincere, responsible, and very hard working. \r\n\r\nShe carries out her business in the \u201c15th of September\u201d neighborhood, which is characterized by the origins of its inhabitants\u2014Ayoreas tribes who are native to the area and relocated miners. They appropriated the area and initiated manufacturing and commerce. It has a warm, sub-tropical climate, with a temperature that varies during the day between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade. \r\n\r\nGludmil has olive skin, brown eyes, and long, reddish brown hair that she wears tied back. She is short of stature with a medium build. Her maternal language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks at home; she speaks Spanish with the general public and for her business. She is seen fourth from the left, wearing a sky-blue blouse with white stripes and black pants, next to the lady with the fuscia blouse.\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her partner, who works at the same business, and with her children; the oldest is studying in school and the youngest is starting kindergarten.  They live in their family house, which they own. It is built of brick and cement, with a corrugated iron roof and a cement floor. It has potable water, electricity, and sewage service.\r\n\r\nHer drive to get ahead led her to form a bank of people with businesses such as baking, selling empanadas, selling traditional boiled beverages, selling cheese, making plaster crafts, weaving fabric, and selling meat pies. Their goal is to request a loan and improve their businesses.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling second-hand clothing as a street vendor. Every day, she and her husband go to the zone\u2019s commercial centers and markets, where they put up umbrellas and set up a sales stand. Passers-by become customers and constantly purchase their garments.  \u201cOur prices are much lower than those of the fashion shops or new brand-name clothing, and we try to sell the best..\u201d, she comments. Her business\u2019s advantage is that her clothing prices are very competitive; the disadvantages are the lack of investment capital and the competition. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to open a clothing and shoe store. She wants to increase her working capital and make a purchase of second-hand shoes at wholesale, in order to offer greater variety to her customers. This is the first loan cycle with the institution in the four years that she has been doing this work.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons that Gludmil is requesting a loan: to purchase second-hand clothing and shoes at wholesale, and to pay her children\u2019s\u2019 school expenses with the profits.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2021.09,"image":{"id":1930814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase second-hand clothing and shoes at wholesale, and pay her children's school expenses with the profits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-24T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-23T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":2775,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gludmil","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gaby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Inez","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luiza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yoselin Jimena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-13T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-30T04:00:00Z","amount":1363.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T04:00:00Z","amount":1462.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T04:00:00Z","amount":1489.28},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T04:00:00Z","amount":1516.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T04:00:00Z","amount":1543.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T04:00:00Z","amount":1572.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T04:00:00Z","amount":1600.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T04:00:00Z","amount":1629.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T04:00:00Z","amount":1659.49},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T04:00:00Z","amount":1689.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T04:00:00Z","amount":1720.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T04:00:00Z","amount":1751.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.18},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.51},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":238.04},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":242.37},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":251.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":630.31,"local_amount":4315.67,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-19T12:11:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4330.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554933},{"amount":446.97,"local_amount":3060.37,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3070.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711469034},{"amount":466.27,"local_amount":3192.48,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3203.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296866},{"amount":477.54,"local_amount":3269.61,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3280.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077012}],"funded_date":"2015-07-24T19:26:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanora Brennan","image":null}},{"id":920406,"name":"Jessica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a parent of one child, Jessica works hard to support her family.

For the time being Shahnoza sews at home only for her friends and family, but she wants to increase her qualifications and experience. Shahnoza has an incentive because she really loves this work and she has an interest in sewing. Shahnoza works with enthusiasm. She has a dream of opening her own studio. But for now she has met with difficulties. She has an old sewing machine. Shahnoza has applied for a loan with high hopes in order to buy a new embroidery sewing machine.

She is arguably among the most successful clients of Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that deals only with smallholder farmers in rural parts of Kenya. Most of the time, Rachel dedicates her time in taking care of her family. With the little time Rachel has, she sells crops from their small farm and also keeps dairy cows and poultry. \r\n\r\nFrom Kiva lenders, Rachel is seeking a loan worth 65000 KES to buy seeds and grow her horticulture business and buy poultry birds. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. \r\n\r\nIt is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to give Rachel access to a loan facility that will aid her to grow her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector.

many problems. However, Piliphine, a small-holding farmer from Siongiroi, has overcome this challenge and has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. Her primary source of income has been selling eggs, milk, and some personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. She has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans that farming is for the older generation; she passionately loves dairy goat farming, and taking care of her goats gives her great joy. She is an early-riser and wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her goat. \r\n\r\nAlthough this humble mom has been making profits by selling goat milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality goat milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. Piliphine is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy goat that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. Through the loan she will buy a dairy goat that will produce more milk. This will help fully satisfy the demand. \r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, which is a field partner, she attended training sessions and was taught the best financial management skills. This will help her save more money to fully repay the loan and to improve her living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":128.4,"image":{"id":1937105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a quality breed of dairy goat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-24T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-23T20:20:04Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Piliphine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3785.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3895.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4009.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4126.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4247.34},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4371.47},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4499.23},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4630.72},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4766.05},{"due_date":"2016-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4905.34},{"due_date":"2016-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5048.7},{"due_date":"2016-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5196.25},{"due_date":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5348.12},{"due_date":"2016-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5504.41},{"due_date":"2016-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5665.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.47},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.99},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.31},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.66},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.05},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.49},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.96},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.48},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.04},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":128.4,"local_amount":12839.73,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":13174.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112070}],"funded_date":"2015-08-16T03:50:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Barrett","image":1341863}},{"id":920390,"name":"Hannah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hannah is 56 years old, married and blessed with four children.

woman from the Vakhsh region. She is 47 years old, and a widow. Urozoy is raising her five sons herself. She practices animal husbandry, and that is how she feeds her children.
