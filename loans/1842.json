\u201cwait and sell\u201d practice. It\u2019s not that effortless. Felomina of General Santos City wakes up very early in the morning and goes to bed late at night in order to meet the demand of her customers. Sometimes a customer knocks at 4:30am to buy one egg worth PhP 6. At times, she has to stay until 12 midnight to take the orders of a group drinking beer in front of her store. Felomina needs to be patient indeed or else customers will brand her as unfriendly and they will patronize other stores. <br \/><br \/>It\u2019s a good thing that Felomina's husband, Carlito, takes his turn in looking after the store. She can also rely on her children to watch over the store during their free hours after school. They share the task because their usual everyday needs are supported by the income from the variety store. However, it cannot fully meet the educational expenses of Felomina\u2019s children.<br \/><br \/>Now that she\u2019s determined to improve her business and increase her profit,  Felomina longs to obtain additional capital of PhP 50,000 that she will use to buy more sacks of rice, grocery items, and beverages to enhance her inventory. She dreams of converting her sari-sari into a convenience store someday and aspires to acquire property such as a lot and a car for her family. She would like to see her children with completed college education and successful careers in the near future. She shares this aspiration with her co-fellowship* members who meet every week to strengthen each other through the Word of God.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":843.77,"image":{"id":1936708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more sacks of rice, grocery items, and beverages to enhance her inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"General Santos City, South Cotabato","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-24T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-23T21:10:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felomina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":421.92,"local_amount":18749.97,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:37:00Z","rounded_local_amount":19101.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434166},{"amount":234.37,"local_amount":10416.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":10612.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955085},{"amount":187.48,"local_amount":8333.32,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":8489.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044929}],"funded_date":"2015-08-16T17:08:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":920602,"name":"Margarita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This nice lady is 37 years old and lives with her retired mother in Ddmashen village of Gegharkunik region.

The price of fish increases during this season and fish vendors find it hard to afford. <br \/><br \/>Juliet, a dried fish dealer who resides in General Santos City, South Cotabato, prepares for the upcoming days. She wants to have additional capital of PhP 50,000 to enhance her buying power when fresh fish gets expensive. She will buy different varieties of fresh fish in volume, dry the fish, and sell it afterwards. This additional capital will keep her business running even during the rainy season. Its income will continually cover their everyday needs and the educational expenses of Juliet's children. <br \/><br \/>Juliet is living with Jerney who suffered a vehicular accident just recently. Since then she has shouldered all the household and business responsibilities including the supervision of three helpers in fish processing. Juliet owns a pick-up truck that is being used for dried fish delivery. Eventually she plans to upgrade it to 10-wheeler truck so she can deliver a greater volume of dried fish. Her goal is to make her business prosper, gain stability in the midst of stiff competition, have her children complete their education, and enjoy better living conditions someday.

They have no access to electricity and for many years they have had to rely on candles and kerosene lamps as their only sources of light. All his life, Carlos has worked in agriculture and cattle raising, helping him to provide for the basic needs of his wife and four children. He hopes to one day have his own vehicle and in this way expand his business.\n\nCarlos is requesting a loan from Soluz Honduras to buy a kit of solar lamps which will help to improve their quality of life, since they will no longer be exposed to the harmful gases and smoke from the candles and kerosene. In addition, they will always have access to a fully charged mobile phone and be able to wake up earlier to begin their daily tasks.

To address this, entrepreneurs like Edna offer PC rentals with automatic access to the internet, basically per hour at a given cost. Usually, the price ranges from Php 10.00 to Php 15.00 per hour, which is a hook to the people for its very inexpensive price. <br \/><br \/>However, what income Edna gets from her current business is not quite enough to provide for all their needs. Now, she is planning to expand her business for a profit increase. With this, she is humbly requesting a Php 10,000 loan, which she will utilize to purchase additional computer units and other materials needed for the renovation of her shop. <br \/><br \/>In advance, she would like to say her thanks and deepest appreciation to those who will help her in this vision. Edna hopes to have a sustainable livelihood in the near future. At the same time, she prays that her children will have a secured future through finishing their schooling. She is also looking after the unity and joy within their family. She regularly meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. <br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1936831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional computer units and other materials needed for the renovation of her shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Las Pinas City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-25T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-24T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1358.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523730},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2716.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434176},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3395.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955095},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2716.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044939}],"funded_date":"2015-07-25T02:48:27Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Zoe Benston","image":null}},{"id":920608,"name":"Glenda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Here is Glenda from Davao City. She is a 38-year-old college graduate who nurtures her family. She is married to a civil engineer and they have children. Her independent woman nature drives her to venture into direct selling and ice cream making. It gives her a sense of productivity and fulfillment.\r\n\r\nDirect selling business is common in the Philippines especially for housewives who want to be productive. Working people who want to earn extra money usually engage in this business also. It\u2019s easy to venture into direct selling business since it typically requires low capital to begin with. Then the entrepreneur or direct selling representative will just enhance the business by expanding her network and target consumers and proper rolling of capital.\r\n\r\nNow that it\u2019s the rainy season, a lean season for ice cream making, Glenda aspires to enhance her direct selling business. She applies for PhP 20,000 loan that she will use to buy more clothes, shoes, cosmetics, pillows and other Avon and Dakki collections. She will sell it to her friends, neighbors and other networks. She\u2019s positive that this additional capital will give her more profit to supplement her husband\u2019s income. Most importantly, she aspires to pay monthly contributions to SSS (Social Security System) and PHILHEALTH. These are government mandated benefits\/insurances for employed workers but Glenda wants to avail of these even as a self-employed worker. Somehow it will ensure her pension at the age of sixty.\r\n\r\nGlenda dreams to have a stable space or a showroom for her business someday. She also desires for a good future for her children and harmonious relationship among her family. She meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has a business making woven woolen products.\r\n\r\nJulia is enterprising, sincere, generous, understanding, patient, responsible, and very hardworking.  She sells her products from place to place in the markets in an area located east of the city, where there are a lot of administrative offices, shops, and headquarters of social organizations. This area has a cold and dry climate, with a daytime temperature that varies between  0 and 12 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\nJulia has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair tied back, a short stature, and slim physique.  Her native language is Aymara, which she speaks in her area.  She also speaks Spanish in the general culture and in her business.  She shares her life with her partner who also works.  They live in a home that her family owns that is built of brick and cement with a tin roof and wooden floor.  The home has drinking water, electricity, and sewer services.  She has a business making woven woolen products.  Her work involves purchasing a variety of colors and types of wool, which she weaves using a loom.  Her work is purely artisanal, \" I started my business working as a dressmaker in some workshops in Buenos Aires.  I gained experience, and then I returned to open my own weaving workshop,\" she comments.  \r\n\r\nThe advantage of Julia's business is that she travels to other cities to sell her merchandise.  The disadvantage is that she lacks an industrial loom and wool to weave.  Julia's dream is to open a store to sell woven items.  She wants to buy an industrial loom and wool at wholesale to make woven items and sell them at wholesale in another city.  This is the first time she has taken an loan with the institution in the 3 years that she has been doing this work independently.\r\n\r\nThis is why Julia is requesting a loan to buy an industrial loom and wool at wholesale to make woven items and sell them at wholesale in another

She is married and has one independent child. Her business is making and selling traditional food. She is entrepreneurial, sincere, a good listener, patient, responsible, and very hard-working. Her business is located in the southern area of the city, the region with biggest growth. It is represented mainly by the agricultural and forestry production, and is the most important area for hydrocarbon production. It is situated at a height of 437 meters above sea level, with a hot, tropical climate and a temperature that varies throughout the day between 21-34 degrees Celsius. \r\n\r\nAdelaida has dark complexion, with brown eyes, long brown hair that she ties back, a short stature, and a robust physique. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks at home and she speaks Spanish in general and in her business. She shares her life with her husband who is employed. They live in their own home built of bricks and cement, with a tin roof and cement floor, and drinking water, electricity and sewerage. \r\n\r\nDue to her drive to excel, she asked for a loan to improve her business. Her business is selling traditional foods such as: majadito (dehydrated beef, rice, fried egg, and fried plantain), loco (dehydrated meat, meat cut into small pieces, yucca, and egg soup), sopa de remojada (bone soup), chicharr\u00f3n (pork rind), and cogote relleno (chicken neck, potato filling and plantain). She does this at lunch time from Monday to Saturday on the street. \"I cook in my house and later carry the pots and dishes on a 2-wheel cart to go sell...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that the food sells out. The disadvantage is lack of furnishings to open a permanent place to sell. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own business. She wants to open a food stall outside of her home. This is the 3rd loan with the institution in the 8 years that she has been doing this work. For these reasons, Adelaida is asking for a loan to buy tables and chairs to open a food stall and stop selling on the street.

She herself is also a blessing to her group, her family and her community in General Santos City by being warm and supportive to her colleagues.\r\n\r\nErnilah is a loving wife to her husband, Fernando, a driver, and a caring mother to their three children. She complements her husband\u2019s hard work by earning additional income for the family through her business. She operates a variety store that offers usual everyday needs of an individual such as toiletries, snack items, canned goods, repacked condiments, and many more. \r\n\r\nBut since her income from this business varies from time to time, she decided to add another enterprise, which is chorizo and embutido making. Embutido is a processed meat combined with hot dog, cheese, raisins, carrots, and other ingredients. She\u2019s correct that this product is quite sellable in their community.

She was a new join-in to CCT in 2015 and there was a little hope aroused in her heart when she discovered Kiva. <br \/><br \/>For several years in Intramuros, Manila, it has been her daily routine to take charge every day of her Piso-net shop business. It\u2019s just a little admirable how she manages to be a full-time mother and a businesswoman simultaneously, despite her age of 45. However, it\u2019s never a matter to her because she really wants to support her husband, Virgilio (taxi driver), in building their family's condition. <br \/><br \/>Being in this business requires a lot of effort even though the income is really not stable. It depends on the customers\u2019 demand. But, since Filipinos love surfing and more, her business has a very good potential for business expansion. <br \/><br \/>But she cannot do that without you. She needs PHP 10,000, which she will spend to maintain her computer business, buy additional equipment to renovate her shop and buy additional PC units as well.<br \/><br \/>She is aspiring that you won't hesitate to help her. She is assuring you that she will not waste your trust and preserve this kind of generosity that you will give to her. <br \/><br \/>Someday, she dreams of having a more affordable kind of life for her family. And, of course, she wants her kids to finish their schooling. She promises to do everything just to give them a good educational background.

They live in Las Pinas City where she pushes her cart all day long to sell fish balls and other known street foods. <br \/><br \/>With her full-blown potential in business handling, she is confident enough to borrow a loan worth PHP 10,000, which she will use to buy additional ingredients and raw products for her business. With her eight years in this industry, she assures you she will repay faithfully with all that she can. <br \/><br \/>In addition to her house rental business, she also oversees an egg-vending business, which, some time in the future, she dreams of expanding. <br \/><br \/>Today, she is really striving  to save money for her children's education. She wants them to finish their schooling and earn good jobs in due time.

This is the sad story of Anderson, a youthful 41-year-old Mzee (old man), and a wise farmer who neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. He farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills near Nkubu, in the central region of Kenya where he grows maize and keeps dairy animals. He also does a side hustle business (timber-cutting) to supplement the merger income he earns from farming. Anderson's farming experience dates back to 2008. Like many other farmers in the region, maize is a cash crop, which he has been planting for as long as he can remember. With time, the fertility of his land has started to dwindle and whenever he plants maize, the yields go down with each growing season. Anderson has also been affected with weeds. <br \/><br \/>Today, Anderson requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy fertilizer, pesticides, and good quality seeds. Through this loan, Anderson is going to increase his crop production and improve his income. This loan will permanently change the living standards of Anderson and there is no doubt that he can find rewarding employment in farming.<br \/><br \/>Support the entrepreneurial dreams of a Kenyan with a loan today!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":95.89,"image":{"id":1937248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer, pesticide, and good quality seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-25T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-24T06:50:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anderson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.93,"local_amount":5093.04,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:55:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5226,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711507128},{"amount":44.96,"local_amount":4495.66,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4613.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112076}],"funded_date":"2015-08-24T02:54:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":920681,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is 53 years old, married, and blessed with five children, one of whom is still in secondary school.

His fatherly love has been enough to show him that he needs to work hard to help his family get ahead with excellent values and foundation. \r\n\r\nMartin is a 32-year-old, smallholder farmer based in Kitale, which is a small agricultural center near the famous Rift valley. He owns a small piece of land together with his lovely wife, and they have been blessed with a lovely family. On the land, they have kept dairy cattle and grown vegetables for ten years. Their main income sources are milk and crops. They recently ventured into a small personal business, or side hustle, as they like to put it. \r\n\r\nFrom Kiva lenders, Martin is seeking a loan worth KES 40,000 to grow his horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to afford Martin access to a loan that will aid him to grow his horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Martin\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business.

He is a hard worker who always says \u201cI eat from my sweat.\u201d He lives in Kilima, a rural village in the rich highlands of Kapsowar. He is happily married and has been blessed with angelic looking children. He has farmed for ten years, and has never regretted it. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs, and crops. Most of the small-holder farmers in Kilima village own approximately \u00bc acre of land per household, and this has made them work extra hard to fully utilize their farms. He has been able to earn a decent and honest living by selling milk and eggs. These ventures have enabled him to send his children to school and feed his family. Albert has planted many trees on his compound and also has Napier grass, which is high in protein and is used to feed his dairy cow. This enhances his milk-selling profits. Because of increased demand, Albert requests a loan to buy a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is a very profitable venture, and he wants to take full advantage of the ready market for dairy products. Through the loan, Albert is sure of satisfying the demand for milk in his area. Through increased profits, Albert is sure that he will repay the loan on time and also be in a position to comfortably take care of his family. Albert, with his entrepreneurial spirit, strength and tenacity, would like to continue fighting so that he can achieve his dream of owning his own business and empowering society by being a source of employment. Juhudi Kilimo, through its training, has helped Albert save more effectively. He plans to add value to his milk through packaging. He also hopes to one day start manufacturing milk products such as yoghurt and cream. \r\n\r\nAlbert will be able to continue farming and succeed with your

people in the Kitale area of Kenya. Bonifasi, a lovely family man overcame this and has been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years. His primary source of income has been selling eggs, milk and some personal business he engages in to supplement his meager income. \r\n\r\nBonifasi passionately loves poultry farming and feeding his poultry makes him very proud. Waking up every day in the morning to collect eggs from his poultry makes him feel fulfilled. Although this humble father makes a profit through selling poultry, the biggest challenge he faces is meeting the demand of the market that is available. He is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. \r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, which is an institution that serves poor, small-landholding farmers, Bonifasi has acquired both financial and technical training.

Shirak is considered to be a poor region, with a high unemployment rate, and low living standards. Lack of access to loan products, bad market conditions, and high costs makes a number of difficulties for people to develop their business in the Shirak region.

Liana lives with her husband and their 23-year-old son, who help her in the store. Liana has requested this loan to purchase refrigerators for keeping vegetables and fruit needed for the store. She needs this investment to be able to bring more fruit and keep it fresh, so customers will be satisfied with the quality of products. \r\n\r\nThis is Liana's second loan. Unfortunately, the first loan, which she got from local financial institutions previously, was very difficult to pay back, and Liana faced some difficulties. However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, she and her husband were able to run their small retail business in a sustainable way, ensuring that they will be able to cover the monthly payments.

When I was still in primary school, a teacher took us on a field trip to a ceramics workshop. It had a great impact on me because we got to work the clay with our hands. My last teacher became my husband. I'm teaching our children, friends and acquaintances who come to us with a desire to learn. I'm very careful when making agreements and doing business. I remember when my husband and I launched our workshop. I had to look after the children and also design our ceramics. But our desire to provide them with a better life was the fuel we needed to continue giving it our best effort. I like to keep shoppers happy with the attractive designs we create. My husband and I work together in the workshop.  Our children help us, and can craft pieces. Several young people from the community also help us with the carving, sanding, applying underglaze and painting. In this way, we all know our own small part in the workshop processes.\"\r\n\r\n\"This microcredit is a huge blessing to our business.

Gulchehra and her husband have been rearing animals and growing crops side-by-side for about 15 years. At the present time they have two hectares of land. On one hectare they have planted wheat, and on the other corn. Gulchehra and her husband have worked hard and as a result they have got another two hectares of land. There is no limit to Gulchehra's joy. Now she needs to clear the land and prepare it for sowing. They will spend the borrowed money on acquiring tractor fuel, miner fertilizer, and nitrate. Gulchehra has applied for a loan herself because MLO Humo support female clients and simplifies the loan process for them. Gulchehra has no doubt that there is a miracle and she will find support.

Cambodia. \r\n\r\nGrowing rice and harvesting on her co-villager\u2019s farm have been the sources of her family\u2019s income for twenty-two years. Rice drought is an obstacle for her farming business, which reduces her income. \r\n\r\nKim Pov does not have enough funds to do the farming for this season, so she decided to lead a group to seek a new Kiva loan via VisionFund.

Luz separated from her husband as she had a bad relationship; since then, it has been up to her to manage the household and she had to work very hard to get her children ahead. \r\n\r\nShe currently has a shop, makes a living sewing and, thanks to the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, has also just built some apartments which she rents out; these businesses pay for the household expenses. The hours in the shop are very long as it opens very early and closes very late: Luz begins at 6am and finishes at 8pm. Luz's business has been well received in the area as it has a wide range of essential products. \r\n\r\nShe will invest this loan in her business as she wants to stock it with more products due to its good reception in the area. Luz is grateful to Kiva for helping her to improve her quality of life."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1931988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock her business with merchandise and provide her loyal customers with a good service.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Los Bancos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2015-07-25T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-24T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1134.38,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":74.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":86.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":87.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":91.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":92.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":93.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":98.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":99.86},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":102.68},{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":104.42},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.9},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.85},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.76},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.23},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.09},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.86},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gemma Kern","image":null}},{"id":921023,"name":"Hergelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hergelyn is 33 years old and married with five children, three of whom are in school.

There, it was all the rage to have a business renting washing machines. He decided to invest in these household appliances to rent to his community. He had great success in his business, and up until now, he has bought 13 washing machines that are located where he lives. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, his demand is growing, and he is applying for his first Kiva loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. He will invest the loan to buy two washing machines. Although his main challenge has been his age\u2014because it is a limitation in the financial sector\u2014his goals to go forward and prosper have not faded.

She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. She values her store so much since it is where she gets the funds to support her child's school needs. \r\n\r\nElvira's simple dream is to have a bigger general store to serve more customers. She aims to send her child to College and see her become professional someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

After selling his farm\u2019s products, he uses the income to grow his business and meet his family\u2019s basic needs.  \r\nThe challenge common to rural smallholder farmers that Reuben is facing is high cost of transportation. To avoid this cost, most farmers resort to dealing with brokers and end up being exploited.\r\n\r\nReuben is seeking a loan to buy a reasonably-priced motorcycle made in India for rural markets in developing countries. This motorcycle is affordable, cheap to maintain and can handle the rough terrain found in rural areas. \r\nWith this asset, Reuben will be able to transport his produce to formal markets where he will get a fair value for his produce.  \r\nYour loan investing into Reuben's business will elevate his family\u2019s livelihood and generate more income for them to meet their basic needs.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":287.9,"image":{"id":1937985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorcycle so as to transport his farm produce quickly to market without it spoiling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-25T22:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-24T22:30:05Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reuben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":7029.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":7234.89},{"due_date":"2015-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":7446.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":7663.94},{"due_date":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":7887.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":8118.45},{"due_date":"2016-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":8355.71},{"due_date":"2016-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":8599.91},{"due_date":"2016-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":8851.24},{"due_date":"2016-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":9109.92},{"due_date":"2016-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":9376.15},{"due_date":"2016-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":9650.17},{"due_date":"2016-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":9932.2},{"due_date":"2016-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":10222.47},{"due_date":"2016-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":10521.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.03},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.62},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.34},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.81},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.35},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.96},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.65},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.41},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.26},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":287.9,"local_amount":29354.75,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":29541.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023964}],"funded_date":"2015-08-24T22:29:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":917257,"name":"Ram\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ramon es un hombre que actualmente tiene 29 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y tiene una linda familia que vive junto a \u00e9l, en una comunidad denominada el tabl\u00f3n.\nRamon cuenta que gracias al apoyo que recibi\u00f3 con el cr\u00e9dito logro comprar sus semillas de papa y a Dios Gracias con esta cosecha le fue muy bien, es por ello que se encuentra muy satisfecho, pero Ramon con el af\u00e1n de mejorar sus condiciones de vida, ha tomado la decisi\u00f3n de solicitar un nuevo cr\u00e9dito que en esta ocasi\u00f3n lo utilizara para la compra de hierro para la construcci\u00f3n de su casa.\nEl gran anhelo de Ramon es poder finalizar la construcci\u00f3n de su casa para darle a su familia una mejor calidad de vida.\n","en":"Ramon is 29 years old and married.
