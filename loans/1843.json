It is in this way that she makes a living and, together with her life partner, is able to afford the household expenses.\r\n\r\nWith the hope of increasing the sales of her business, Maria has decided to invest in the purchase of a larger quantity of chickens, vitamins and chicken feed. Because she does not have the economic capacity to do so, she is asking for a loan from FUSAI in order to be able to make this investment and increase the sales of her chicken farm. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":81.02,"image":{"id":1932875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy chickens, vitamins, and chicken feed for the growth of her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2015-07-26T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-25T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":13.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":13.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":14.41},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":15.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":16.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":16.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":17.4},{"due_date":"2016-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":18.26},{"due_date":"2016-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":18.76},{"due_date":"2016-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":19.53},{"due_date":"2016-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":20.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.41},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.29},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.76},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.4},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.26},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.76},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.53},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":13.6,"local_amount":13.6,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":13.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696490315},{"amount":35.97,"local_amount":35.97,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":35.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711399973},{"amount":15.44,"local_amount":15.44,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":15.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730921130},{"amount":16.01,"local_amount":16.01,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":16.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752011883}],"funded_date":"2015-07-26T22:49:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Allen","image":1982692}},{"id":921140,"name":"Corazon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Corazon is 53 years old, single and lives in Mangidkid, Plaridel, Misamis Occidental.

They all live in a remote town called Kapsowar, a place that doesn't offer the best opportunities, but this Mum has learned to deal with that. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kapsowar, in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming and her main source of income has been milk, growing maize, vegetables and tomatoes. She also has a side hustle business (a shop). Jane has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has made profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with the challenge of timely delivery of her produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\" she said. Jane mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance institution that helps aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Jane is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to market has been a challenge, which is why she has suffered so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan Jane is going to achieve her dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Jane feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women so that they can gain respect and equality. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Jane will never suffer losses due to a delay in delivery of produce to the market and also, she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. She is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping with the farm work. With your loan, she will improve her living conditions and ensure her children of a secure future.<br \/><br \/>Help Jane make her dream come true; this loan can change her life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":134.2,"image":{"id":1937965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-26T03:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-25T03:10:03Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4954.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":5098.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":5247.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":5401.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":5559.12},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":5721.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":5888.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":6060.9},{"due_date":"2016-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":6238.03},{"due_date":"2016-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":6420.35},{"due_date":"2016-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":6607.97},{"due_date":"2016-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":6801.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.22},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.89},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.61},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.2},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.08},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.27,"local_amount":5227.02,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5363.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023962},{"amount":81.93,"local_amount":8193.37,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8407.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112087}],"funded_date":"2015-08-24T03:46:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":921175,"name":"Carolyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carolyn is 34 years old and married with six children.

He lives in a remote location accessible on poor roads that are not busy. Arranging logistics of transporting his produce from the farm requires too much planning, time and money. To solve this problem, James is seeking a loan to buy a reasonably-priced motorcycle made in India for rural markets in developing countries. This motorcycle is affordable, cheap to maintain and can handle the rough terrain found in rural areas. \r\n\r\nWith this asset, James will be able to transport his produce to formal markets where he will get better prices for his produce.

He lives in a humble home in the town of Kitale, along with his family. He has always strived to give them a decent life and a good education. He has been doing agriculture for 7 years now. He makes money selling produce from his farm, including milk, eggs, and crops.He also has a side hustle business (motorbike business). He enjoys ploughing his farm and watering his plants. \r\n\r\nCrop diseases pose a big challenge for him and also poor productivity. Vincent is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs. With the loan, he plans to buy good quality seeds and fertilizer, which will help increase soil fertility and productivity on his farm. Increased productivity will allow him to improve his quality of life and living standards. Through training from Juhudi Kilimo, he has learned about the culture of saving and he plans to use the increased income to improve his farming.

","en":"Djiparkhan is very thankful to Kiva and to all the lenders who helped her with her previous financing.  She currently has two cows and 14 sheep on her farm.  This spring, she planted tomatoes on 1.04 hectares of land and found some customers for her crop.  However, her harvest suffered from the consequences of a parasite called \"cotton bollworm\" (tomato fruitworm), and her tomatoes dried up.  Djiparkhan lives alone with her son without any outside assistance.  She has an active account in the bank; she still has 30,000 som (KGS).  Since a \"force majeure\" caused the destruction of her harvest and forced her to start her business anew, she has turned to Bai Tushum and requested a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy pesticides to treat her tomatoes and prepare her soil.  She will also use 30,000 som (KGS) to repay her current loan.  Djiparkhan is planning to restore her business, to build some assets and to plant onions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1938837,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

She is 25 years old, married, and the wonderful mother of two children.  Because they were having financial problems, several years ago her husband went to another country to find work and Nasiba was left alone with her two children.  At first her husband earned good money abroad.  However, as a result of the crisis, he has not been able to send money home for the last few years.  Without money, it became difficult for Nasiba and her children to live, so she decided to start her own business selling traditional women's dresses.  She herself makes and sells all her dresses at the market.  Happily, Nasiba found a good deal of success and she now has many clients.  She always greets her clients with a smile, speaks with them politely, and offers advice.\r\n\r\nRecently she received an order for new dresses, but she does not have enough money to buy the fabric and thread.   For this reason she has applied for a loan.  Nasiba hopes that she will receive support so that she can amaze her clients with her new

Joyce lives with her handsome husband in Kapsowar, a small rural town in Kenya. The Kapsowar area is also referred to as the mango region of Kenya because half the mangoes consumed are from that region.\r\n\r\nShe has been farming for the past five years and has never looked back. To earn a decent and honest living, she sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. Joyce is satisfied with the returns she gets through farming. However, she wants to diversify and start horticultural farming. The main challenge she faces is accessing funds.\r\n\r\nShe is kindly requesting a loan to buy seeds and start horticulture farming.

in Kitale, Kenya. He sells produce from the farm, which includes milk and other crops, at the local market. He also engages in other personal businesses to make enough money to provide for his family. John spends a lot of time tending to his animals and land. Spraying is the activity he finds to be the most enjoyable. John complains that working on the land is becoming more strenuous with age. \r\n\r\nThe one factor contributing to the strain is the type of tools he employs. John is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to purchase farm equipment. Small-holder farmers usually prefer indigenous tools because they are economical, feasible and sustainable. Despite being common, they are generally not preferred to modern tools since they are inefficient and tiring to use.

","en":"Edwin is a 23-year-old man who is currently married to Enma. Thanks to his parents' efforts, he managed to finish primary school; later, a lack of financial resources led him to work from a very young age in order to be able to meet his needs and to be able to finish secondary school.<br \/><br \/>Now, Edwin lives with his family in a community called Pusuchisi in the Juan Montalvo parish of Latacunga canton, located in the province of Cotopaxi of the Republic of Ecuador. This area is located in the northwest of the province; it is a rural area with very cold weather. Because of the climatic and geographic conditions, the majority of the people there earn their livings farming and raising young animals. These conditions also have an effect on the harvests, from which they obtain products of the Sierra Region. The people live day-to-day on these activities.

She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of coconut to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her stall. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nAnnabela hopes that they will always have available stocks of coconut to sell and dreams that she, together with her family, will always find time for each other despite their busy schedules. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Through those years he has gathered so much experience and all the farming techniques are at his fingertips. \r\n\r\nHe practices mixed farming on his farm and through the profits he has managed to take care of his family's needs and also give his children a good education because he believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success.\u201d \r\n\r\nEzekiah is a man who is very enterprising and he is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 to buy seeds and start horticulture farming on his farm.

City, where its land offers varieties in fruits and vegetables, we find the trust bank called \u201cAgua Tibia\u201d or, \u201cWarm Water\u201d. The group is comprised of 11 women who are working towards a better future for both themselves and their families. \r\n\r\nThe women of this group are thrilled to start their first loan cycle with Friendship Bridge and begin reinvesting into their businesses. Ciriaca, one of the group\u2019s members, is a single mother of two who dedicates her time and effort to raising pigs and selling chicken meat.

Rose is married and has seven children. She is also a grandmother and has three grandchildren whom she takes care of. Both Rose and her husband are entrepreneurs.

Returns combined from both enterprises amount to 300 USD.  <br \/><br \/>However, seasonal changes are affecting the growth of the business. Due to erratic rains which affect the water table, the output level in terms of winter cropping turns out to be very low. On the other hand in terms of broiler production, when there are no events taking place, especially celebration functions, demand becomes low and cash flow tend to be slow which results in less profit.  <br \/><br \/>As a hard worker, Rose says it is time to have multiple sources of generating income and her eyes are set on a pig enterprise. Therefore, she is looking for capital to venture into a pig enterprise. This loan to her is a bridge to attaining her dream of becoming a pig farmer. Initially Rose and her husband wanted to invest in a piggery, but due to lack of capital, they decided to venture into broiler production whose initial investment on a small scale is low.<br \/><br \/>The loan will enable Rose to buy pigs, receive training on how best she can sustainably raise the pigs and acquire marketing skills.

Her loan request was rejected each time because the creditors did not find the existing family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. Mzia requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start up loan program provides start up credit soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who, regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, do not have access to credit products. With the received credit, Mzia will purchase stock of used clothing and sell locally with price mark-ups.
