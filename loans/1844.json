The majority of them work as textile producers of typical Guatemalan skirts that they distribute and sell in their local community as well as in the surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nCelestina, a 37 year old married woman with no children, is the owner of a small shop that sells goods used for daily consumption. Her business has helped her and her husband out tremendously by covering costs that her husband\u2019s work could not cover alone. As of now, Celestina is requesting a loan so that she can keep her shelves stocked with the newest goods to be sold. Celestina plans to buy specific items such as soap, sugar, salt, noodles, eggs, oil, beans, and any other goods that her customers request. Celestina also plans to invest any remaining capital from the loan into her secondary business of weaving typical Guatemalan skirts. She hopes to buy attention-grabbing threads that are unique to her style. \r\n\r\nDuring the two previous loan cycles, the group has greatly benefited from the Micro Credit Plus programs that are offered by Friendship Bridge. Other than the loan, clients receive a monthly, non-formal education that touches on various topics of personal development such as financial literacy, business administration, family planning, and women\u2019s empowerment. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1307.31,"image":{"id":1938606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She likes this activity because she can work at the square of her town, and this allows her to work at home in household chores and take care of her children. She helps her husband with some expenses. In order to continue buying and selling native clothing, Linda is requesting a loan to invest in her business. With this money she will buy g\u00fcipiles (traditional tunics), fabric cuts, woven belts and everything related to the clothing line. Linda has the dream of buying more land so that her children can build their houses.

They have had 3 children together and have always worked hard to support them. He has grown coffee since he was young, selling it through COCAFCAL, of which he has been a member for 5 years.

Her work involves making and selling homemade bread. She is a good mother and an enterprising, sensitive, responsible and extremely hardworking woman. She runs her business in the southern part of the city, which is known for its busy economic activity and as the site of the biggest markets, countless shopping centres and shops. The area has a warm, subtropical climate with daytime temperature which vary between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade. Fabiana has light brown skin, dark eyes, long brown hair, which she wears tied up, and is short and slim. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed and this is what she speaks with her family. In other situations and for her business, she speaks Spanish. She lives with her parents, who both work, and her son, who is not yet of school age. They live in their own home which is made from brick and cement and has a corrugated roof and a cement floor, drinking water, electricity and plumbing. Her work consists of making and selling homemade bread, such as: Mollete - the usual bread made with flour, granulated sugar and butter; Pan de Arroz (Rice bread) - with rice flour; Pan dulce - with raisins, egg, milk and sugar; Rosca de ma\u00edz (corn ring) - made with cornflour; Tortilla - bread dough, flattened, sprinkled with sugar and flour, to produce a kind of puff pastry. She makes her bread independently in a room in her house which has been specially converted for baking. \"There are many varieties of bread and I try to satisfy my customers using the ingredients I have to hand\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she can work and look after her son. The downside is the shortage of capital to buy different types of flour by the quintal (approximately 100lbs). Her ambition is to open a big bakery in a central location. She would like to boost her income by buying corn, rice and wheat flour, among others, by the quintal. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the year she has been working as a baker. And so, Fabiana is applying for a loan to buy different types of flour by the quintal so she can boost her income and take care of her

He is intelligent, committed to his studies, dedicated, responsible, and very hard-working. Ramiro studies in a public university located in the barrio of San Pedro which is considered a patrimonial zone of the second order, which has preserved the old along with the modern, in the particular traditions of the city. The climate is cold and dry with a temperature that varies during the day between 0 \u2013 12 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nRamiro has a dark complexion, dark eyes and short dark hair. He is short in stature with a slender build. His native tongue is Aymara which he rarely speaks, because he is a student and lives in the city. He resides with his mother who works selling meals. They live in their own house and have electricity, water, gas, and a sewage system. \r\n\r\nRamiro is in the fourth year of a five year program in architectural studies. He enjoys designing spaces, using different scales, manipulating techniques, tools and conventional and digital mediums of expression. His character is one of service: \u201cI want to be a poet who thinks and speaks in the idiom of construction,\u201d he commented.\r\n\r\nParallel to his studies, Ramiro works administering a garage. The advantage of his studies is that he can do them a night and work in the daytime. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to purchase a portable computer and study materials such as instruments of the trade (T-squares, pens, grafite pencils, a paper cutter, etc.)\r\n\r\nHis dream is to create an enterprise to conduct management, assessment, and intervention in projects in architecture and urbanism. At present, Ramiro wishes to purchase a portable computer and required study materials. This is his first sequence of loans with this institution in the four years he has devoted to professional studies.\r\n\r\nThis is why Ramiro is requesting a loan, which he needs to complete studies for his professional career.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1934629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"purchase a portable computer and study materials to complete his professional training in architecture.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-27T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-26T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramiro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-17T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1473.98,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":67.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":60.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":61.95},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":62.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":66.26},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T04:00:00Z","amount":66.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T04:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":69.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":71.6},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T04:00:00Z","amount":71.21},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T04:00:00Z","amount":74.43},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":74.9},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T04:00:00Z","amount":76.48},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":78.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T04:00:00Z","amount":79.07},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T04:00:00Z","amount":82.31},{"due_date":"2016-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":83.18},{"due_date":"2016-12-12T04:00:00Z","amount":84.77},{"due_date":"2017-01-10T04:00:00Z","amount":86.98},{"due_date":"2017-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.31},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.83},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.57},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.26},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.48},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.95},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.53},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.55},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.12},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.37},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.24},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.83},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.04},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":128.06,"local_amount":127.97,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:37Z","rounded_local_amount":128.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711469041},{"amount":1346.94,"local_amount":1346.01,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1346.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296872}],"funded_date":"2015-08-20T21:18:36Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":922412,"name":"Zhanyl","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0416\u0430\u043d\u044b\u043b, 52 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0432\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 2 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 -

She operates a business buying and selling quilts and bed covers.  She is an enterprising woman, self-reliant, optimistic and very hard-working.  She operates her business in the Villa Avaroa neighborhood of Santa Cruz.  Thirty-two wells here supply water to the city from underground aquifers.

Delia's husband is a construction worker.\r\n\r\nDelia buys and sells bedding: quilts, bed covers, sheets, pillows, etc.  She works as a street vendor, going from place to place, wherever she is most likely to find buyers.  She works most days, mornings and afternoons.  \"I used to work in a mine\", she tells us, \"but had to stop to protect my health . . . I have my own business now and it is slowly growing\".  There is a lot of demand for her quilts and other bedding this time of year (winter) and Delia is applying for a loan that she will use to stock her business because she lacks the capital to do it without your help.  She has operated her business for 3 years and this is her first loan from us.  \r\n\r\nFor the future, Delia hopes to open her own bedding shop.

Their village is located in a remote area far away from the city so it is essential to know the bus schedule, otherwise, the villagers have to walk a lot of kilometers. The principal local economic activities are agriculture and animal husbandry.\n\nThe whole group is very grateful with the loan because its members will be able to invest it in their businesses. Leonor, Maria Angelica and Lucia will invest in a grocery store while Mar\u00eda del Carmen, Ma. Francisca, Ma.

Together, she and her husband, Jos\u00e9 Luis, who works in construction, support their four children, all of whom are in school. Alejandra\u2019s main motivation for dedicating herself to sheep farming is that in her community is easy to take care of the cattle and sheep thanks to the abundance of the food needed for these animals. Once the sheep gain the ideal weight, she sells them to people who cook a traditional dish called \u201cbarbacoa.\u201d Currently, Alejandra has two sheep but they are not sufficient because the demand is gradually growing and she needs both expand the sheep yard and buy more food for them. \"We're really grateful because thanks to the loan we will buy more sheep and achieve our dreams,\" said Alejandra who shares this activity with other group members.\n\nWith her experience, and better management of her business and earnings, Alejandra has not had any problem with it. For example, she takes advantage of the grass that is growing in the land and every afternoon takes her animals to eat from it.\n   \n* The photograph was taken on the stairs at the bottom of the local kiosk.

She hopes to earn more income to maximize the business and to provide better health care to her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1939159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for the plowing fee and to buy organic pesticide and organic fertilizers to apply to her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Dambae district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2015-07-27T19:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-26T19:40:05Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vannra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000},{"due_date":"2016-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-25T13:29:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":922061,"name":"Sophol","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sophol is a 29-year-old married factory worker with a grown-up child.

is a responsible, diligent and punctual young woman. She is 35 years old, and she is still not married. Zaynabbibi lives with her parents in the Shahrituz district. She has a medical education and is a pharmacist. She owns a pharmacy in the district. Zaynabbibi accepts and checks prescriptions, dispenses medicine according to prescriptions, consults pharmacy patrons on the correct and safe way to take medicine, keeps inventory of prescriptions, watches after the product stock, and also takes care of resolving customer complaints regarding dispensing of prescribed medicine. She treats her work responsibly because a mistake in dispensing medicine can lead to serious health implications for patients and even death. Now Zaynabbibi needs to buy new medicine, but does not have enough money, and this is why she requested a loan. There are very few pharmacies in the district, and Zaynabbibi urgently needs to buy all the necessary medicine for patients.

She is 53 years old. Hanifa lost her husband many years ago and raised her children on her own. Hanifa rears animals and in this way provides for her family. Her children help her with this business. Despite all the difficulties in her life, she has been able to remain a strong woman. Hanifa has applied for a loan in order to hold her son's wedding.

She is the mother of two children. Gulzipa is retired and also rears animals and grows crops. She began rearing animals 20 years ago by buying livestock to the value of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulzipa's hard work, today she has three cows. She grows clover and potatoes on 0.69 hectares of land. Her monthly income is 9,000 som (KGS) but these funds are not enough for a decent life and to support a family and farm. With the aim of further developing her business, Gulzipa has therefore applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow to increase the size of her herd. Gulzipa plans to invest the proceeds of the loan in further increasing her herd of domestic livestock and building a barn for the livestock."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":149.81,"image":{"id":1939918,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a cow in order to help bolster her family's income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Borbash village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-07-27T21:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-26T21:50:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.64,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulzipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2237},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2185},{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2316},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2385},{"due_date":"2015-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2455},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2528},{"due_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2603},{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2680},{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2759},{"due_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2840},{"due_date":"2016-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2762}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.92},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.13},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.98},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.71,"local_amount":4422,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4615.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711412094},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-19T12:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2348.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730934310},{"amount":36.96,"local_amount":2316,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2417.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.64,"payment_id":752026404}],"funded_date":"2015-07-31T18:11:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":921940,"name":"Ma.

","en":"Kunduz is 54 years old and the mother of two children. She has a secondary education. She is retired now. She also rears animals as a source of additional income for her family, having started the business 36 years ago with 20,000 som (KGS). Her husband and children actively help her on the farm.
