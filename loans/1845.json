She lives with her partner and has one son aged 8 years. Her business is making traditional bread. She is a good mother and is enterprising, sensitive, sincere, understanding, responsible and very hard-working. She runs her business in the 'Cotoca' area which is to the east of the city and is renowned for its traditional production of jelly and molasses (both made from cane sugar) as well as baked products made of corn and cassava, such as 'sonso', 'roscas' [ring doughnuts], 'arepas' [corn tortillas], cu\u00f1ap\u00e9s and 'bizcochos'. The area has a warm sub-tropical climate with a temperature which varies between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade during the day. \r\n\r\nLuz is olive-skinned with brown eyes and long chestnut-coloured hair which she wears tied behind her head. She is of short stature. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks among the family and she speaks Spanish for general culture and for the business she does. She shares her life with her partner who makes a living from transport, and with her son who goes to school. They live in her parents' house, built of wood with a sheet metal roof and earth floor. It has electricity and water from a well, extracted by pump. It does not have a sewer connection. (She is in the centre of the photo wearing a red blouse with white flowers.) \r\n\r\nDue to her need to improve her financial situation she set up a communal bank of people with businesses such as installing solar panels, selling seed for sowing, ceramic handicrafts, making 'sao' straw hats, selling second hand clothing, selling natural medicines, selling food, making fabric, hairdressing and selling cheese, in order to ask for a loan and improve their businesses. Her business is making and selling traditional home-made bread such as 'Cu\u00f1ap\u00e9' (small rolls made of cassava flour with cheese), rice empanadas (baked from rice and cheese), 'Zonzo' (cassava puree mixed with cheese and shaped on a stick), wheat 'bizcochos' (little hard rolls made from wheat flour) and other items. She does her work independently in a room set up as a kitchen to bake in her home. \"I set my business up quickly, with a small domestic oven and borrowing flour, eggs and lard from my neighbours, because my son had already been born and I needed to work\" she says. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she has daily sales; the disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy an industrial oven to replace her domestic oven. Her dream is to open a complete bakery inside a market. She wants to expand her business by buying an industrial oven to change her domestic oven and continue with her business. This is the fourth loan cycle with the institution in the 8 years she has been doing this work. \r\n\r\nThese are the reasons why Luz is asking for a loan to change her domestic oven and continue working with her traditional

years old, married, and has two children. She has a secondary education. She is responsible, ambitious, optimistic and kind-hearted. Her children actively help her on the farm. Her family is very tight-knit and relations in the family are very good. 30 years ago Tazhikan began farming to get income for her family. Thanks to Tazhikan's hard work, she was able to achieve good results in her business, and her profit per month is on average 7,000 som (KGS). She has two cows, 13 sheep and two horses. The income from the business has enabled Tazhikan to raise and educate her children. In order to develop her business further, she has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) to buy ten sheep to increase the size of her flock.

She has to be creative and resourceful in order to save for hers and her husband\u2019s urgent needs and medical insurance. She knows that she has to prepare for the future. She plans to expand her business by buying additional supplies for her inventory, and she asks for a PHP 30,000 loan for this purpose. She hopes you are willing to help her so she can increase her profit, sustain their everyday needs, and boost her savings. <br \/><br \/>She is a faithful member of CCT Credit Cooperative and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1939191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy additional supplies for her inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"General Santos City, South Cotabato","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-28T00:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-27T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10187,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523751},{"amount":180,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":8149.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434201},{"amount":225,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":10186.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955120},{"amount":45,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2037.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044964}],"funded_date":"2015-07-28T02:19:06Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":922106,"name":"Robina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robina is 46 year old vigorous, married woman.

El clima es lluvioso y tropical, con temperaturas de hasta 35 grados Centigrados, por lo que resulta una lluvia tibia, muy agradable. El pueblo se encuentra en medio de la selva tropical, rodeado de gran vegetaci\u00f3n y una amplia variedad de fauna.\nWilson es de tez trigue\u00f1a, ojos pardos, cabello negro corto, baja estatura, complexi\u00f3n f\u00edsica delgada, y su lengua materna es el Quechua que se habla en el lugar y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y por el trabajo que realiza. Su vida la comparte con su pareja que trabaja en la agricultura, viven en una casa propia construida de madera y adobe con techo de calamina y piso de tierra que cuenta con energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y agua de pozo extra\u00edda mediante bomba, no cuenta con alcantarillado. \u00c9l se dedica al tratamiento del suelo, removiendo las tierras y abon\u00e1ndolas para crear una estructura favorable para que la siembra y cosecha sea r\u00e1pida y uniforme y permita a las nuevas plantas tener un f\u00e1cil acceso a los recursos vitales de los nutrientes, el agua y la aireaci\u00f3n, actividad que comparte con su pareja y con sus hijos. Actualmente el gobierno nacional decidi\u00f3 mejorar la calidad de vida de estas comunidades otorg\u00e1ndoles el derecho al uso de agua potable, \u201cconsumimos agua sucia de pozo, lavamos nuestras prendas con agua contaminada de rio y constantemente nos enfermamos por tomar agua sucia\u2026\u201d comenta.

Su sue\u00f1o es usar agua potable, ella desea realizar la instalaci\u00f3n de agua potable a su cocina, ba\u00f1o y lavander\u00eda para que su familia deje de beber agua sucia. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 5 a\u00f1os que construye su casa.\nEs por esos motivos que Wilson solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la instalaci\u00f3n de agua potable en su cocina, ba\u00f1o y lavander\u00eda para dejar de beber agua sucia.\n","en":"Wilson is 37 years old. He lives with his partner, he has a 10-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl and he works in soil treatment and vegetable growth.\r\nHe is a good father. Strong, a fighter, reliable, determined, responsible and very hardworking. He works in the \u2018Villa Tunari\u2019 area, a region with great natural beauty, where 2 rivers meet forming the Chapare river. Weather is rainy and tropical, with temperatures up to 95 F, so rain is warm and very pleasant. The town is in the middle of a tropial forest, surrounded by large vegetation and a vast variety of fauna.\r\nWilson has dark skin, brown eyes, short black hair, he is short, thin and his first language is Quechua, spoken in the region and he also speaks Spanish for general knowledge and for work. He shares his life with his partner and they both work in agriculture. They live in a house that they own built out of wood and brick with corrugated iron roofing and dirth flooring. They have electricity and well water extracted by pump. They don't have a sewage system.\r\nHe works in soil treatment, removing dirth and adding compost to create a more favorable structure for planting and harvesting to be fast and uniform and to allow new crops to have easy access to important resources such as nutrients, water, ventilation. He shares this activity with his partner and children. Currently, the goverment decided to improve the quality of life of these communities granting them the right to drinking water, \"we drink well water, we wash our clothes with contaminated river water, and we are sick all the time because we drink dirty water...\" he says. The advantage of this town is that the goverment has granted them the right to use drinking water, the disadvantage is the lack of capital to install a drinking water system in his kitchen, bathroom and laundry room. Her dream is to use drinking water. He wants to install this system in his kitchen, bathroom and laundry room so his family can stop drinking dirty water. This is his first set of loans with this bank in 5 years since he started buinding his home.\r\nFor this reason, Wilson is asking for a loan to install a drinking water system in his kitchen, bathroom and laundry room so he can stop drinking dirty water.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1934874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

To get home she must cross the mighty waters of the river, by riding in an \u201coroya\u201d (a tram consisting of a metal basket fastened to cables by straps).

They live in their own home built of adobe, brick and cement with a tin roof and dirt floor, which has electricity and well water drawn by an electric pump, but no plumbing or sewer connection. \r\n\r\nShe works in agriculture, planting and harvesting the land, an occupation she shares with her partner and their children.

After school, I'd stop by the workshop of a local wood carver, Salihu, to observe him and his workers as they carved different objects out of raw wood. They really caught my attention, and I visited the workshop daily. Realizing my interest, Salihu offered to train me. I was most interested, so learning the skill was not a difficult thing. Within a short time, I could finish the carved items. At a certain point in time, my parents could not afford to further my education so I decided to continue learning under Salihu and pursue a career in this field. What inspires me most is when people express appreciation for my designs. It is my dream to one day become the owner of a well-established art workshop and be able to employ many workers to reduce the alarming rate of unemployment in my country.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am grateful to those of you who help fund my loan for your unfailing support.

She runs her business from the El Reto\u00f1o neighborhood, about 20 kilometers from the city. The area is notable for its artistic tradition, producing primarily urns, flowerpots, and other household items. The warm, subtropical climate yields daytime temperatures between 21-35C (70-95F).\r\n\r\nDelia has olive skin, brown eyes, and long gray hair that she wears braided.

It has no sewage drain.\r\n\r\nHe raises domesticated ducks which produce eggs of a good size and flavor, and they constantly clean the area of slugs and snails and are relatively easy to care for. The area where he lives never had potable water because of being remote and rural.

Eliza has a secondary school education, and she raises livestock as the primary source of income for her family. She began raising livestock 13 years ago, with the purchase of livestock for 18,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Eliza's very hard work, her farm now has 40 sheep, 2 horses, and 2 cows.

Meet Shadrack. He is 39 years old. He comes from Kitale, which is a town in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Shadrack is a smallholder farmer who keeps dairy cattle and poultry. He is also an entrepreneur engaged in other small personal businesses(motorcycle business). For the past ten years that Shadrack has been doing farming, he finds milking to be the most enjoyable activity. However, he doesn't enjoy cleaning the dairy unit as much. There is no doubting his deep connection to farm animals, as he names and occasionally talks to his animals. \r\n\r\nShadrack is seeking a loan to purchase farm implements.

We will finish our dream house and our children will live a better life.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Pilar, 69, from Tigbauan, Iloilo, speaks this phrase with faith as she shares her aspirations with her co-fellowship* members at CCT. She has been a dedicated member of the organization for almost 13 years, where she continually gains inspiration from Bible reflections and sharing of life experiences. <br \/><br \/>Pilar is married to Juan, a laborer, and they have two children who are already working. The couple is now relieved of their children\u2019s huge educational expenses. Pilar is now working towards full progress of her business. She raises hogs in their backyard, operates a variety store that offers usual commodities, and distributes mineral water in their community. <br \/><br \/>It\u2019s her chance to save some money for her and her husband as they age. Self-employed workers like them have no pension or medical benefits when they retire; hence they just rely on their own savings or any help from their children. <br \/><br \/>As of now, she needs to buy additional piglets and feeds. That is why she is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will also add supplies to her store inventory and buy more gallons of mineral water. With these, she can increase her income and boost her savings. She would really appreciate your kind support to her.

She is good mother and is determined, perseverant, patient, friendly, responsible and very hardworking. She runs her business in the 'Plan 3000' area where most people are multilingual; Aymaras, Quechuas and Guaran\u00eds, mostly. Situated south of the city, the area was taken over by migrants who set up trade which is now flourishing. It has a warm climate with a temperature which fluctuates between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade. Petrona has a dark complexion, brown eyes and long black hair and is short and slim. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks at home. She speaks Spanish, however, for general purposes and for her business (seated and wearing a black jumper with pink edging). She lives with her children who are still all at school. They live in their own home, a wooden building with a corrugated roof and earthen floor which has electricity and water which they pump from a well, but there is no plumbing. Since she needs to boost her income, she set up an entrepreneurs' bank with 8 members (who work in selling fruit, selling milk, making textiles, selling food, selling second hand clothing, agriculture and selling soft drinks) so they could all apply for loans and improve their businesses. Her business involves selling 'Patasca' which is a succulent food, which is much sought after by people suffering from hangovers. It is a kind of thick ,which can be made from meat of can be a mixture of beef and pork, and is served with rice. In Petrona's words: \"it is a meal to beaten in the morning, quite early, and some people even eat patasca as a hangover cure...\". She works in her fixed premises every day of the week mid-morning and in the evening. The advantage of her business is that she has regular customers each day but the disadvantage is that she lacks capital to invest in the business. Her dream is to own her own traditional food restaurant. She would like to extend her business by buying tables and chairs so she can serve more customers and boost her sales. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 2 years she has been running her business. The reason why Petrona is seeking a loan is to buy tables and chairs to sell food to more customers and boost her income. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2080.65,"image":{"id":1935132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables and chairs to sell food to more customers and improve her income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-28T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-27T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petrona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yoselin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anair Karletzi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maira Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenny Kelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silpa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-19T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":19500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T04:00:00Z","amount":1514.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T04:00:00Z","amount":1491.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T04:00:00Z","amount":1518.76},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T04:00:00Z","amount":1546.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T04:00:00Z","amount":1574.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T04:00:00Z","amount":1603.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T04:00:00Z","amount":1632.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T04:00:00Z","amount":1662.08},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T04:00:00Z","amount":1692.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T04:00:00Z","amount":1723.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T04:00:00Z","amount":1754.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T04:00:00Z","amount":1786.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.01},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.31},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":242.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.34},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":251.84},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":261.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1117.5,"local_amount":7646.4,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7710.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711469058},{"amount":472.89,"local_amount":3235.22,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3262.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296889},{"amount":490.26,"local_amount":3354.42,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3382.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077029}],"funded_date":"2015-08-21T14:29:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Crossfield","image":null}},{"id":922437,"name":"Kibriyo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kibriyo is a strong woman.

In the Phils. factory workers earn only the minimum wage which is not adequate to raise a family so this led Billa to borrow from lenders who charge very high interest rates.\r\n\r\nTherefore Billa is humbly asking for your assistance to lend her an amount of Php 8000 to pay off her current loans and save her from paying the excessively high interest. She will appreciate much your positive response to her request and is thanking for the much needed help.\r\n\r\nBilla meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work.  CCT staff and volunteers conduct weekly fellowship meetings for the factory workers before their work routine to do Bible readings, prayer and discipleship sessions to encourage and inspire them to do their best in life.\r\n\r\n *The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.

This is Yusuf. He is the head teacher of Sumaya Girls School, a girls school with 540 students in the rural area of Nsangi in Wakiso. Sumaya Girls School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistently clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Thus, installing a water filtration system will save the school money in the long-term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 liter tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. Sumaya Girls School will repay its loan from its school fees, which it collects each term. Yusuf ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases and increasing the number of students that come to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":185,"image":{"id":1938460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Wakiso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-07-28T15:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-27T15:50:05Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sumaya Girls School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3035000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":185,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":614775.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755507252}],"funded_date":"2015-07-29T16:32:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Walker Fuller","image":null}},{"id":919368,"name":"Bertha Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Bertha, de 28 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ada, es madre de dos hijos, estudio hasta s\u00e9ptimo grado, su compa\u00f1ero de vida es propietario de una discomovil y sus peque\u00f1as hijas est\u00e1n estudiando.\n\t\nBertha, vende papas fritas, licuados, entre otros alimentos y este trabajo lo realiza desde hace 5 a\u00f1os. \n\nEl cr\u00e9dito lo utilizara para comprar tecles para montar la estructura de la discomovil.\n\nBertha, sue\u00f1a con comprar un terreno para construir una vivienda digna para sus hijas y mejorar su calidad de vida.","en":"Bertha is 28 years old.

This is Justine. She is the Head teacher of Nansuse Bright School, a mixed school in the urban area of Gayaza in Kampala with 250 students. Nansuse Bright School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

They are very poor.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she does not have any animals, thus her children lack the nutrition from dairy most of the time. \" We have no money to buy milk. Our children eat no dairy products and I feel responsible for this. Up until two years ago, we were in a worse financial situation.

Lady Irene Junior School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistently clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. \r\n\r\nThe loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank and pump, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. Lady Irene Junior School will repay the loan from its school fees, which are collected each term. Edith ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne

This is James. He is the Head teacher of New Africa School, a mixed school in the rural area of Luwero with 500 students. New Africa School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 1000 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. New Africa School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. James ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":315,"image":{"id":1940081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Luwero","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-07-28T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-27T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"New Africa School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5160000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1032000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":315,"local_amount":1032000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1046779.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755507256}],"funded_date":"2015-07-29T13:51:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":922583,"name":"Ion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ion is a farmer from Untesti village, Ungheni Region in Moldova.

I don't know how to wrap up when more clothes are needed to be washed. It's tongue-tying,\" says Lief. \r\n\r\nFor the past 4 years, Lief has owned and operated a laundry shop in Araneta, Quezon City. Through the support of her husband, Noel, who is an overseas Filpino worker, she ably operates this business and provides for their two children's education. Surprisingly, with her abilities and skills, she has been able to expand and amplify her resources. Now, she already has three helpers who work with her in the shop. \r\n\r\nThe laundry business has indeed helped Lief's family to cover their daily expenses. Every now and then, customers come to Lief to deliver bulk dirty clothes for washing and dry cleaning. Most of the time, customers go to laundry shops because they find no time for their own clothes due to heavy schedules and dragging deadlines. Since they can pay, it's an advantage and an opportunity, of course, to Lief. \r\n\r\nHaving this business in her life is really a milestone for Lief. However, it becomes a rough road when situations like she mentioned above happen, which is why she has come to KIVA. Lief wants to acquire additional materials and equipment for the maintenance of the washing machines. She humbly requests a PHP 50,000 loan and hopes that you will consider this. Lief dreams to someday have more branches and prays that her children will finish their studies and have a good future ahead. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He would like to invest in a purchase of raw materials, including wood, beads, and metal plates.\r\n\r\nAli has been selling through NOVICA since 2012. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"It is my curiosity that has guided me in learning this art and honing my skills. I got interested in wood carving when I was a child, when I used to visit my brother Salihu's workshop. I would go to his workshop when I returned from school and try my hands at sanding masks. When I completed junior high school, my parents could not further my education and so I joined Salihu at his workshop. I got paid for the work I did, which I saved to be able to buy my own tools. After 12 years of working with my brother I started to work on my own. I have taught other carvers, and currently have four carvers working with me. I love the art of mixing colors and fixing aluminum plates to design an item. My hope is to become successful and be able to assist several people who cannot further their education due to financial constraint.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you for helping to fund this microcredit, as it will allow me to prepare more carvings in time for the busy season.

Every hour holds a new promise. Every night, dreams are brought with hope and every day is what a man chooses to make. <br \/><br \/>This is what inspires Nenita, a resident of Araneta, Quezon City, married to Roquilo and blessed with two children. From nothing, Nenita (or \"Nits\") now owns a sari-sari store and also regulates a house-rental business. But before she stood where she is right now, it took her a long road of sweat, tears, pressure, faith and persistence. But ceasing never occurred in Nenita's vocabulary, instead, without hesitation, she chose to continue pressing forward. <br \/><br \/>Year 1999. She started entering the trading field, purchasing and distributing commodities to people. Later on, she was personally established until doors opened her to CCT. It was in 2003 when she got her membership. Gradually, she learned techniques in business handling through the mentoring and fellowships done every Thursday. She also had the chance to know and get inspired by studying God's word. <br \/><br \/>Together with her husband, Nenita can barely earn more or less 20,000 PHP a month, not quite enough to sustain a family and keep their businesses running. Though really at some point it was hard to be always on the ball, due to delayed payments of customers who take credit and the inevitable huge expenses in sending a college student to school, the couple sees it eye to eye that they are willingly providing for their household needs.<br \/><br \/>Nits comes to KIva with a purpose. She had this idea of further expanding her sari-sari store business since she subtracts here most of their financial needs. She would like to access PHP 40,000 to buy additional grocery items to sell in her store. It would be an ample response if you allow her this chance.<br \/><br \/>You can help Nits walk closer to her dream to success.  <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is from the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi city. She lives with her husband, who works in security services and gets a fixed salary.

She gets a small income but has a great desire to better the living condition of her family. \r\n\r\nNino requested a loan from local financial institutions several times to start a trading business but had no success. Her loan request was rejected each time because the creditors did not find the existing family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. Nino requested a loan from Credo, and her loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit with soft conditions for the country's rural poor who, regarded as high-risk borrowers because of their low income, do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Nino will purchase stock of various kinds of clothing and will start selling in her community at increased prices. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family's income, and the family members will be able to improve their living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":129.27,"image":{"id":1939957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to start a clothing trading business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tbilisi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2015-07-28T18:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-27T18:50:13Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nino","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":75.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":102.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":109.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":109.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":115.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":116.37},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120.02},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":129.37},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":127.86},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":134.41},{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":136.1},{"due_date":"2016-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":142.63},{"due_date":"2016-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":144.86},{"due_date":"2016-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":149.41},{"due_date":"2016-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":155.92},{"due_date":"2016-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":159.01},{"due_date":"2016-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":165.5},{"due_date":"2017-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":169.21},{"due_date":"2017-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":174.52},{"due_date":"2017-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":182.93},{"due_date":"2017-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":185.76},{"due_date":"2017-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":192.2},{"due_date":"2017-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":197.63},{"due_date":"2017-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":203.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.18},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.18},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.14},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.37},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.22},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.54},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.49},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.25},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.18},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.19},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.24},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.16},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.55},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.48},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.14},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.53},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.32},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.59},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.49},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.93},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.94,"local_amount":75.43,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":76.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711521006},{"amount":46.18,"local_amount":102.63,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":104.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731036821},{"amount":49.15,"local_amount":109.23,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":110.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752125657}],"funded_date":"2015-08-27T18:03:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victoria Irwin","image":672153}},{"id":922667,"name":"Hussein","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hussein, 24 years old, is the breadwinner for his family of 6 members. \r\n\r\nHussein rented a shop last year where he sells fruits and vegetables for a living.
