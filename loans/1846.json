She is enthusiastic and hardworking, always seeking the best for herself and her family. She lives in the rural community of Semillero.\r\n\r\nShe began her work two years ago due to the need to help out in her household. Her spouse works on banana farm and what he receives as a salary is little to meet the basic needs of the household. This is one of the reasons for deciding to start her business making undergarments, pijamas and tailoring. She works from home so she can also care for her children. She sells her merchandise when her two children go to school in the afternoon and cares for her other son herself. \r\n\r\nShe has always wanted to have economic independence and feels that this is an opportunity to achieve it in the future. She is requesting this loan to buy a sewing machine and supplies like fabric, thread, lace, elastic and more. \r\n\r\nShe is a member of Banco Mujer Sembrando Esperanza which was formed approximately 9 months ago in the Semillero community. It is composed of six other members with the same objectives: to grow in their different economic activities in order to improve the quality of life for themselves and their families.

She is single with a 2 year old son and majors in gastronomy. She is intelligent, committed, tenacious, sweet, caring, sensitive, responsible and hard working. She carries out her studies at a technical institute of excellence in the town of Sacaba which is located 25 kilometers to the south of the city where the residents make a living mainly in agriculture. The adolescents and the children quickly take on a job to support their families and put their studies aside. The jobs are normally related to the care of livestock, nannies, or construction worker helpers in the city. These jobs are risky and bring the boys, girls, and adolescents possible labor exploitation situations.\r\n\r\nMelvy has tan skin, brown eyes, long black hair that she ties behind her neck, and a thin physical build. Her native language is Quechua which is spoken there and she also speaks Spanish for the general culture and for business. She carries out her life alongside her parents who manage a guesthouse and with her son who is still not school-age. They live in their own home which is made of adobe with a roof made of corrugated iron and a cement floor. They count on the electrical energy service and use water from a well that is extracted from a pump. \r\n\r\nShe is studying gastronomy and she is currently in her first of the three years of the career. She enjoys helping people and she likes to have them savor the flavors and natural essences of her kitchen. Service is in her nature. She comments, \"I study gastronomy and work in my parents' hostel. In a short time, my family's business is improving...\" Parallel to her studies, she also works as a cook in her family's guesthouse on her parents' property. The benefit of her business is that she can count on daily sales, but the disadvantage is that it doesn't leave her time to study gastronomy. Her dream is to open a big restaurant. She wishes to achieve the purchase of a lap top in order to continue studying so that her business can continue improving. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in one year of developing this career. It is for these reasons that Melvy is requesting a loan to purchase a lap top to continue studying gastronomy.

She is happily married to Pablito, her business partner. Raising seven children is their biggest challenge but with their faith in God and diligence they have raised them well. Five of them are already working, one is still in high school and the youngest is still in elementary school.\n\nRegina is grateful that God has blessed her with a general store and eatery business for a number of years already. It has been her stable source of income to support her family. She buys essential food items such as canned goods, coffee, biscuits, beverages and toiletries from a wholesaler and sells them at retail price. Aside from her small store she also has a small eatery that sells simple snacks. Although some customers can not fulfill their obligation to pay she has already established a quite number of customers who are loyal to her and pay her on time.\n\nShe is now humbly asking for a 40,000 PHP loan to buy large quantities of grocery items, mostly food items, to better serve the needs in her community. She will use part of the loan to buy ingredients like fresh meat, vegetables and condiments to cook meals for her small eatery. She is thanking God and you in advance for your good heart and the financial aid that will be given to her. Her earnings are a big help to cover her daily needs and to send her children to school.\n\nRegina's simple dream is to grow her store. She prays that her children will always be obedient.

Starting with a small business, she was able to expand it over time. Nargis treats her customers very politely and always gives them good advice on choosing one or another product. At the present time little stock remains in her store, and she needs to buy a new batch of goods such as perfumes, fabrics, household chemicals and so on.

She wants to buy and sell clothing and attract permanent customers for her goods. She is gentle and communicable with clients.

She owns cows, sheep and cultivates a corn field close to her house. In order to complete the household income, her husband works as a day laborer in larger farms during harvesting periods. \r\n\r\nLuisa decided to purchase a biodigester in order to save money by reducing her energy and chemical fertilizer expenses. By inputting her animals' manure in the system, she will become her own supplier of renewable energy (biogas) and nutrient-rich organic fertilizer. Further, cooking with biogas instead of wood will improve her family's health, since they will not inhale the toxic smoke anymore. Treating the manure will avoid the contamination of water sources and the contagion of infections.

The proliferation of this business makes the competition stiff. Store owners try many techniques to make it stable and competitive. Evangeline, age 34, is from Polomolok, South Cotabato, and she adds fruits and vegetables to her inventory to stay competitive. Not only that, she also adds to her income through firewood and charcoal vending. In this way, her income can provide for her family's daily expenditures and the educational costs of her four young children. She is preparing for their college education, so she wants to save as early possible now. In order to do that, she has to improve her store by adding sacks of rice to her inventory. She is requesting a loan for 20,000 PHP for this purpose. Part of the loan will be allotted to buy other grocery supplies and beverages. \r\n\r\nIn due time, she hopes that her business will progress and will give her family a comfortable life.

It is a first class suburban municipality which has very fertile soil and favorable climate. This is why agricultural crops and livestock production thrive in the area. \r\n\r\nGrace, her husband Silvestre, and their four children reside in this beautiful town of Polomolok. Grace owns a flourishing barbeque stall and pays seven workers to help her. She has many customers who take out barbeque as viand and packed meals. Some customers want to eat in while drinking beer or other beverages. To accommodate them, Grace would like to buy additional chairs and tables for her stall. She needs 50,000 PHP supplementary capital for this purpose. Later on, she can also offer drinks and beverages to match her barbeque. It will surely boost her income and savings to reach her dream of building another structure for business. This will ensure the college education of her four children and a bright future for the whole family. She prays for a happy family where God is the center of their lives. \r\n\r\nGrace is a devoted member of CCT Credit Cooperative and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

It\u2019s not like office work that starts at 8:00 am and ends at 5:00 pm. Food stall operators go to market early to buy necessary ingredients, endure the heat while cooking, and defy their throbbing body pain after every day of work. \r\n\r\nShiela, age 40, embarked on her food stall business as an additional income generating venture. Her husband, Zaldy, is a common minimum wage earner whose income doesn\u2019t suffice for their family\u2019s daily needs. Shiela grills barbeque in front of their house so she can earn extra money while taking care of their children. Her regular customers are her neighbors, the local community, students and working people. Profit derived from her business helps a lot in their daily expenditures but she still needs to save a lot for her children\u2019s education. Now she\u2019s planning to cook more barbeque to take advantage of the ongoing school operations. More students are expected to buy from her and it will boost her income. This is why she prays for 18,000 PHP in additional capital that she will use this to buy more ingredients for her barbeque stall. May God knock at your compassionate heart and may you be a blessing to her.\r\n\r\nShiela aspires for her business to grow and her children to finish their schooling to get a better chance to land a more stable job. She gives importance to a harmonious relationship among her family members. She is an inspiration to her co-fellowship members at CCT who regularly meet every week to reflect on God\u2019s Word and share stories about life and their businesses. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay Micro Finance

She's been running her store for 10 years now. She has already experienced different circumstances that really tested her faith. There were times when her capital was almost drained due to huge collectibles. Some of her neighbors pay weeks or months later for the goods they get from her store. Rosela remains strong because this is her way of assisting her driver husband, Lorenzo, in providing for their children\u2019s needs. Two of their children are studying in college.\r\n\r\nA sari-sari store is comparable to a convenience store, but it\u2019s smaller and has limited products. Examples of these products are sachets of toiletries, snack items, canned goods, instants, candies, beverages and other commodities. It\u2019s quite advantageous for the people in the community to have an accessible variety store to buy one candy, an egg, and so on. This is the reason why sari-sari stores proliferate in the communities of the Philippines. This is also the reason why the competition becomes stiff. Customers prefer to buy from stores with wide selections and supplies. \r\n\r\nRosela worries about the competition because she can only offer limited stocks. She appeals for your help through a loan worth 25,000 PHP which she can use to buy more supplies to enhance her store. She aspires to improve her sales to be able to earn more. She dreams that in the near future her business will progress and she can be a general merchant. She wants her children to finish college and obtain a good and stable job. She\u2019s praying for long life, mental and spiritual well-being for her whole family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

That is why he needs to know the best date to plant his crops. He wants to take advantage of the good timing to plant, but he does not have enough money. That is why he has decided to request financing to buy seeds, fertilizer, and pesticide to grow his crops and have food for his family.\r\n\r\nArnulfo\u2019s dreams are to help his children study and develop in society as professionals.

support him any more. This is why he decided to make a living working as a farmer and when he came of age he signed up for military service. He is now in a relationship. His partner takes care of household tasks and they have a two-year-old daughter. \r\n\r\nCarlos is a private security guard in a residential area. He works 24 hour shifts: he starts work at 8:00 am and leaves at 8:00 am the next day. In order to get there at this time he has to leave his house at 4:30 am because he walks 30 minutes to the bus stop and then has a bus journey of two hours followed by another one which lasts 20 minutes in order to get to work. On his days off he works on the farm, which allows him to feed his family. \r\n\r\nCarlos needs this loan to buy fertilizer, insecticides and pesticides for his corn and bean crops. When he gets these products he will be able to use them on his crops when they need them. As he is not often at home he will also pay for a workforce to help him work the land. \r\n\r\nCarlos dreams of being able to build his house out of a stronger material. His house is currently made of mud brick and he would like to build it out of brick. He also wants to give his daughter the education that she deserves and wants her to grow up in a safe place.

She is a woman with good character and family responsibility, who is very well-known in her community for her practice of moral values. She did not go to school due to many circumstances of lack of resources and little interest to excel in her family. She is single because her partner migrated to the United States and little by little they lost communication. A long time ago, Blanca looked for different alternatives to provide for her family because there are always family expenses. For a long time she made a living raising cattle and in dairy production, but as timed passed, her ability to work lessened and for that reason she decided to work raising pigs, to fatten them and then sell them in the market. She has a facility on the patio of her house and in addition to having pigs and poultry, soon she wants to invest in the production and sale of those animals. \r\n\r\nBlanca has decided to ask for a loan to increase her pig sales because she has seen that they have the potential of production and one of her sons has agricultural expertise that can serve to guide the production process. With the loan, she will have available money to buy piglets, food and to improve the installation of the pen. With this she will have to dedicate time and work to fatten the pigs, but at the end of the cycle, they will be ready to sell and buy other piglets. Blanca dreams of seeing her children graduate from college so that they can find a good short-term job. She also wants to grow her farm and diversify it.

very service-minded man who is keen to work to get on in life. He had six years of primary education but, although he wanted to study more, his family's financial situation did not allow this. He is a married man and his wife works as a nurse and home help. They have no children yet because they want to be ready and ensure that they have everything they need for a good family life. No\u00e9 has grown basic grains since he was very small and this is his only means of supporting his family. He has always worked in agricultural and has, therefore, gained a great deal of experience and has adapted to the environmental situation which becomes worse every year.

widow with no children. She has a high school education and has been working in animal husbandry and agriculture for many years.

She is a single mother, and it's difficult to raise children. She has had her share of hardships but she is not discouraged and continues to enjoy her life.

He is married and has a lovely family with six children between the ages of 4 and 16.  They live in a community called Nahuala.  Cruz devotes himself to two business activities so that his family will not be in need.  His first job is working as a bricklayer, which he has been doing for 20 years.  It is his biggest source of income.  His second business activity is working as a tailor.  In his free time he is in a musical group.  With this effort that he makes day to day his family has gotten ahead.<br \/><br \/>For a long time Cruz has worried that his family does not have a decent house.  In spite of all of his efforts, it has not been possible for him to build his house.  Therefore, in order to now be able to do that and make this necessity possible, he has decided to request a loan.  He will use the loan to buy cement, lime powder, sand, iron, and cement blocks.  <br \/><br \/>Cruz puts forth great effort in his work day after day in order to be able to make his loan payments and to build his house before the end of the year.
