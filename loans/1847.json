This will allow him to save money so that he can keep the promise he made to his wife and allow them both to have a better quality of life. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":42.63,"image":{"id":1937407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy chickens and feed in large quantities to minimize expenses in the long-term","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Montel\u00edbano","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2015-07-29T20:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-28T20:30:05Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.18,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Jose Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.03,"local_amount":70074,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:46:18Z","rounded_local_amount":77398.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711503075},{"amount":14.42,"local_amount":36509,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":40325.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.18,"payment_id":752108835}],"funded_date":"2015-08-03T06:18:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":923502,"name":"Leone","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leone is a 49 year old mother with 7 children, she runs a small convenience store in her village to earn a living.

Hasan is a young and responsible man from the Hamadoni region. He is a builder. Hasan lives with his mother, wife, and two children. His eldest daughter is five years old, and his son is two years old. Hasan's mother mainly looks after the children.\r\n\r\nUntil now, Hasan's mother has not worked, but she has had a great talent for sewing. She has sewn dresses for herself and for her relatives, for free. But Hasan's mother has not been able to continue sewing because her old sewing machine (in the photograph) has broken. A new sewing machine is expensive and their family has not been able to afford one. Hasan understands that cutting and sewing occupy a very important place in his mother's life, and he has decided to give her a present. He has applied for financial support in buying his mother a new sewing machine. Hasan will be grateful for your

He and his wife, Miriam, who is a midwife, are blessed with two children who are already in college. The majority of Filipinos struggle to make ends meet, but they do their best to provide for their children to give them a better future. \r\n\r\nFor the past five years, Jeremias has operated a \u201cvideoke\u201d rental business. No matter how hard life is in the Philippines, Filipinos are basically cheerful and happy people. During weekends, and on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, or even just an ordinary get-together, they gather at a friend's house to sing their favorite songs till the wee hours of the night. They often use a rented videoke, a music entertainment system in which a device plays the music of popular songs and people sing the words to songs they choose. Others go to a videoke bar to unwind after a week's hard work.\r\n\r\nJeremias is humbly requesting a 30,000 PHP loan to buy a videoke machine, microphones, and cable wires. He has already quite a number of clients in his community who rent his videoke machine almost every weekend. The only difficulty he encounters is there are times his videoke unit is returned damaged, but Jeremias hopes that his business will prosper as he adds new units to better serve his clients. He values his business as it helps augment his family\u2019s income to send his two children to college. Jeremias is thanking God and you in advance for your financial help. \r\n\r\nJeremias\u2019s simple dream is to grow his entertainment business. He prays that God will bless him in all areas of his life. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and draws strength and inspiration from studying the word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1935795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Entertainment","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a videoke machine, microphones, and cable wires","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-29T21:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-28T21:20:04Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeremias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":135,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:35Z","rounded_local_amount":6109.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523696},{"amount":180,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":8146,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434135},{"amount":180,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":8145.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955054},{"amount":180,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":8145.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752044899}],"funded_date":"2015-07-29T21:40:08Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:12:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":919714,"name":"Kunja Bihari Shg-C Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nirupama is 37 years old and is the featured borrower of Kunja Bihari SHG-C from Koraput district. \n\nThe lady standing to the right-hand side is Nirupama.

Though it was actually a disappointment, she never considers herself a mess. In contrast, she strives even more to prove that success is never far from reach to those who have the guts to take risks and courage to face life. \r\n\r\nShe is very enthusiastic and positive in life. In fact, she is very hopeful today that you would allow her to borrow the amount she needed (PHP 10,000 in particular) to garner additional stock of fruits and vegetables to sell in her stall at the marketplace. Maybe this is also the reason why her colleagues enjoy her company. \r\n\r\nTo mention, they regularly meet every week to encourage one another (simultaneously studying the word of God). She has this living hope. She believes that someday, through hard work, her inventory will grow and that her family conditions will stay safe, successful and sound.  \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

children. They live on the beautiful island of Coron in Palawan. They may not have the luxuries enjoyed by families living in first world countries but, as with most Filipinos, Rochelle's family is happy and content with the simple life, having three meals a day and sending their children to school. \r\n\r\nRochelle has a small general store, which is their source of income to meet the family's day-to-day needs and the children's schooling. Although her sales are low, at times, because of bad weather, Rochelle maintains her positive outlook and joyful spirit that she can get through with their lives.\r\n\r\nTo help sustain and expand her store operations, Rochelle is humbly asking your help for a PHP 40,000 loan to buy large quantities of grocery items, such as canned goods, coffee, eggs, instant noodles, beverages etc. She wants to make sure that her store can offer most of the essential food and household items. She thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her. Rochelle's earnings will be a big help to cover the family's daily needs and the children's schooling.\r\n\r\nRochelle dreams of having a big grocery store someday. She aims to give her children a college education to allow them better opportunities in life.

She is married to Bernard and blessed with five children, one of whom is in high school, two of whom are in elementary school, and two who are not yet school age. With five children to feed, Rizza and her husband run two businesses. She has a backyard piggery where she appears in the photo. She also has a food vending business. As with a majority of Filipinos, most families struggle to make ends meet, but they are also resourceful enough and filled with faith that they can get through anything.\r\n\r\nRizza makes local rice cakes like \"suman\" (sweet steamed sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves), a favorite among Filipinos. She sells her rice cakes to her neighbors in her town. She also started to raise hogs in her backyard, and it is a profitable business. She is thankful that she was allowed to start another business to augment her family's income to support the needs of her family. \r\n\r\nShe is now seeking your financial help for a loan of 10,000 PHP to add piglets to raise in her backyard. She will also use part of the loan to buy ingredients, such as sticky rice, coconut milk, and sugar, to make her native rice cakes to sell. She would be very grateful if you could grant her the funds she needs to sustain and grow her businesses. She is thanking God in advance for your support.\r\n\r\nRizza's precious dream is to build her piggery and someday put up a small eatery. She aims to send all her children to school to allow them better opportunities in life.

Sometimes they are running when there are policemen pursuing them to get some fines. <br \/><br \/>Theresa from Barotac Viejo, Iloilo is chasing the crowd in order to get higher sales. She is vending \u201ckwek-kwek\u201d, a popular street food in the Philippines. It is made from boiled egg covered with flour, deeply fried and skewered on a bamboo stick. It is usually dipped in vinegar with fermented chili and pepper. It\u2019s really an appetizing and saleable snack. <br \/><br \/>She earns enough to help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs. But she can hardly afford the educational expenses of her children who are studying in high school and college. Her husband Ricardo is also running his own small enterprise and both of them patiently work hard for the sake of their children. <br \/><br \/>Theresa appeals for a PHP 20,000 loan to buy ingredients like eggs, flour, vinegar, and oil for her food vending business. Hopefully, she can earn a higher profit to sustain all their needs and also set aside some amount for the future. This may be one step forward in reaching her dream of renovating their house and having professional children. <br \/><br \/>Theresa is a devoted member of CCT Credit Cooperative and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

same products at a higher price. The difference between the two costs will be the entrepreneur\u2019s profit. The products may range from cheap rags to expensive condominiums or houses and lots, depending on the entrepreneur\u2019s capital. <br \/><br \/>Adora from Barotac Viejo, Iloilo, is doing buy-and-sell of various products such as toiletries, laundry needs, cleaning materials, and some school supplies. She has contact dealers from whom she can get the products at lower prices. She will then sell the products directly to her friends, neighbors, relatives and other network. <br \/><br \/>To her advantage, she chooses the products that do not decay or rot. But the disadvantage is \u2013 she has no place to display her products, so she carries them from house to house. She braves the rain and heat of the sun to earn substantial income. Now she plans to take more orders from her customers and deliver the products afterwards. <br \/><br \/>With this method she can avoid carrying heavy loads on her shoulders because she will only carry pre-ordered products, but she has to be ready for whatever order and quantity that her customers will demand from her. This is the reason why she would like to borrow supplementary capital amounting to PHP 20,000. Hopefully her request will be granted soon.<br \/><br \/>Adora is a widow but her children are no longer dependent on her. Nevertheless, they are still part of her dream to have a comfortable life someday.

At age 15 he moved with his parents and siblings to another community.  His father bought land there and that is where he has lived since 1975.\r\n\r\nPedro is married and has 11 children.  The eldest no longer lives at home since they have married and formed their own families.  Only the youngest four live at home and attend the community school, with the support of their father.  Pedro inherited land from his father when he passed away, and he also bought land himself through his work, so when he got married he went to live there.  It is where he grows organic coffee and enjoys the harmony of the environment.\r\n\r\nPedro's mother is still alive and he visits her daily as she lives nearby.  He says there is no electricity in the community so lanterns and candles are what they use.  But he wants to lead a different life and therefore is requesting a loan to buy a solar system for his house to install lighting.  This will allow him to work at night and his wife will be able to get up early in the morning for harvest time and to make food for the harvesters.  Pedro will be able to remove coffee beans at night with the light from the solar panel.\r\n\r\nPedro is very grateful for this opportunity to buy a solar system."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1937497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"To install a 100-watt, 5 luminary solar energy system.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":279,"posted_date":"2015-07-30T08:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-29T08:10:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":495.34,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":225.15},{"due_date":"2017-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":270.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.27},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-04T01:54:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":920852,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":145.84,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy chickens, animal feed and vitamins.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2015-07-30T08:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-29T08:20:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":49.18},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":51.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":53.03},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2016-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":57.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":61.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":64.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.18},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.03},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.19},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.96},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.37,"local_amount":47.37,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":47.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711400026},{"amount":48.99,"local_amount":48.99,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":48.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730921176},{"amount":49.48,"local_amount":49.48,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":49.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752011921}],"funded_date":"2015-08-17T22:15:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":920851,"name":"Santos Marcelino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santos tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada, vive con su conyuge y sus dos hijos en una zona rural del distrito de Pucar\u00e1 que se encuentra ubicado en la provincia de Ja\u00e9n, regi\u00f3n Cajamarca, en la sierra norte de Per\u00fa.

She has currently a cosmetics business; she shares that she learned about this business through a friend several years ago. \r\n\r\nThe loan that she will take out now is to increase capital (to buy cosmetics wholesale) that she will acquire from the cosmetic company and afterwards will sell in her booth. This form of work allows her to generate resources to support her family economically, since she is married and has two children. \r\n\r\nWhen asked about what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the training, the health area, and the savings that the institution offers. \r\nPictured are only seven members of the A.C. since Lidia, after her payment, had to go to her booth.\r\n "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2784.97,"image":{"id":1937459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cosmetics wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2015-07-30T11:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-29T11:40:02Z","loan_amount":5925,"lender_count":143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ursula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Wilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicasia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janeth Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":40768,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":5925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4511.16},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4753.28},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4882.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":5152},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5292},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5436.2},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5725.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":655.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":690.82},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":709.57},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":728.95},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":748.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":769.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":790.07},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":832.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1346.45,"local_amount":9264.44,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":9290.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711481956},{"amount":709.57,"local_amount":4882.36,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4895.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731000480},{"amount":728.95,"local_amount":5015.64,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5029.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752088717}],"funded_date":"2015-08-28T18:36:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Pezdek","image":null}}]}
