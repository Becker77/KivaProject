She left her clothing sales business to her sister, and opened a food sales stall just outside her home. She is the first one on the right, wearing the black sweater. \r\n\r\nThe loan she obtained was used to buy second hand clothing wholesale. She didn't encounter any problems, so her repayments were punctual. Due to the need to work from home, she set up a bank of business people with businesses such as second a bakery, sales of second hand clothing, dairy products, baby clothing, cosmetics, empanadas, and leather handicrafts, to request a loan and improve their respective businesses. \r\n\r\nHer business is in traditional food sales, such as majadito (dried meat, rice, fried egg and fried banana), locro (stew of dried meat, chopped up meat, yucca and egg), Plato Cruce\u00f1o (meal made of fried banana, rice and fried egg). She says \"I changed activity due to health reasons, I sold all of the clothing and now I work from home doing what I have been doing since I was a little girl, cooking\". \r\n\r\nShe works every day of the week for lunchtime outside her home, with a couple of parasols and some chairs to sit on.

Astghik\u2019s husband is in the Russian Federation and from there he sends money for his family. On the farm, Astghik has cows, pigs, piglets and chickens.

She currently sells her friends and neighbors make up, perfumes, body creams, anti-aging treatments, shampoo and massages among other products offered through the catalogs. \r\n\r\nShe offers convenient payments for her customers, however her capital is very low to offer products in the long term and she often loses the opportunity to sell higher quantities. \r\n\r\nWith the aim of overcoming this limitation, she is requesting her first Kiva loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy perfumes, creams and make up, as requested by her customers. \r\n\r\nGreisy, aged 29, is a mother of two young children, and is separated from her partner.

Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. \r\n\r\nThe loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nMubende Light School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Chris ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":121.88,"image":{"id":1941919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mubende","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.5 31.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-07-30T15:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-29T15:20:07Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mubende Light School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3235000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":34,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404375},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":404375},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":404375},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404375},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":404375},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":404375},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404375},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":404375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.88},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.88},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.88},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":121.88,"local_amount":404375,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":406471.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755507258}],"funded_date":"2015-07-31T13:20:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":924049,"name":"Rosalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalie, 40, is a beverage dealer from Buhangin Proper, Davao City.

Meet Hillary, a 28-year-old farmer from the remote village of Kuserwo, situated in the Rift valley province of Kenya. The living conditions in this area are tough because there is no clean water nor electrical connections. \r\n\r\nHillary lives with his lovely family on a small piece of land where he keeps dairy cows and poultry and grows a wide variety of crops. For 10 years, his primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and horticultural produce. Hillary's biggest challenges are disease and a shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs such as chemicals to prevent these diseases. \r\n\r\nHillary made the decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help him improve his farming activities. Sometime last month, he applied for a loan for expanding his horticulture farm. This will enable him to expand his operations and increase his overall output. The additional income from the expansion will go to Hillary's children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is becoming prohibitive for low-income communities, especially in the rural areas. As a result, kids are forced to drop out and start working to contribute their earnings to their families. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Hillary\u2019s children will acquire a quality education that will act as a strong foundation for a bright future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":29.81,"image":{"id":1939072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To  buy seeds and expand his horticulture farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-07-30T17:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-29T17:20:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hillary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.57},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.43},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.35},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.83},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.81,"local_amount":2981.11,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3004.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023991}],"funded_date":"2015-08-01T23:00:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":921002,"name":"San Cayetano Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 SAN CAYETANO, es un grupo nuevo que se form\u00f3 en la localidad de Santan\u00ed, integrado por 15 se\u00f1oras responsables, humildes y trabajadoras, que se fijaron como meta el crecimiento de cada una de ellas, no solo como persona, sino tambi\u00e9n en lo econ\u00f3mico.\nLa Sra.

She is 45 years old. She is married and she has three children. Habiba lives with her family in the city of Dushanbe. She operates a small business. She buys fabric and embroiders it into national dresses which she sells at market. Everything that she earns is spent on supporting her family. She is not able to save money for other more long-term goals. Habiba wants to increase her turnover, since demand for her products is increasing. But she does not have enough funds for other needs. As a result she has applied to MDO Arvand to get a loan with the aim of increasing her working capital.

He is 48 years old and works tirelessly to raise animals. Through these humble tasks, he aspires to offer all of his children a university education. <br \/><br \/>Joash learned to do farm work at a young age, thanks to his parents. He has a tiny plot of land to live off, just under half an acre, and has always struggled to support his family. For over five years his income source has been from selling milk, poultry, and vegetables. He supplements the meager income by doing other personal business. Joash passionately loves dairy farming. Milking and feeding his own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. He is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in his village. Milk, poultry and vegetables are very perishable, and these products require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. Kitale area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. <br \/><br \/>That is why Joash is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Farmers like Joash use motorbikes to transport passengers and farm goods to and from the market. They are suited for areas with poor road networks, which are inaccessible by cars. They are also very cheap to acquire and maintain. <br \/><br \/>Invest in Joash\u2019s future and you won't regret it. He is full of promise.

Meet Esther, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Kapsowar area of Kenya, near the famous Rift valley escarpment of Kenya.\r\n\r\nEsther, 43, has been farming for the past 20 years. Through these years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet.\r\n\r\nEsther is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by buying seeds so that she can plant them and once the crops are ready for harvest she can sell them. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy seeds for planting.\r\n\r\nKenya's Kapsowar area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for crop produce. This means that Esther could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Esther, but she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing.\r\n\r\nEsther believes that this loan will be of much help and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for crops. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable a permanent change in her life and increase her business.

Jodak School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 1000 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. Jodak School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Lazarus ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":193.75,"image":{"id":1941951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Luwero","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-07-30T22:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-29T22:40:04Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jodak School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5160000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":34,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":645000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":645000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":645000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":645000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":645000},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":645000},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":645000},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":645000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":645000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":646185.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755507259}],"funded_date":"2015-08-01T16:28:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":924120,"name":"Tujipange Women Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The lady raising her hand in the photo is Siprosah, a member of Tujipange women group in Nakuru Kenya.

an optimistic and hardworking woman. She is married and has four children. She lives in a small rural town. From childhood Zamira dreamed of becoming a teacher, but her family's lack of financial resources was an obstacle to higher education that she could not overcome. She married right after finishing high school, and became a housewife. Even being at home all the time, she is never still. She and her husband do all they can to provide everything their children need. <br \/><br \/>In order to earn a reliable income for necessities Zamira and her husband started their own business in animal husbandry. Zamira raises livestock, and sells their milk and meat. She earns a good income doing this. Her husband also works in a local workshop as a cabinet maker and brings in additional income for the family. Together their earnings are enough to live at an average level. Still, they don't have enough to cover all their needs. Now Zamira and her husband want to buy a few more animals to feed. To do this she contacted Arvand for a loan to buy cattle. Zamira thanks Arvand in advance for the support, which will lead to a better quality of life for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1937092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-07-30T23:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-29T23:10:04Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zamira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":440.4},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":443.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":475.86},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":492.37},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":499.18},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":526.78},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":543.72},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":578.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.56},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.06},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.01},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.12},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.6},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.35},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-28T15:58:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":924147,"name":"Domingas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Domingas is married and she has three children.

The work is constant, day in and day out. There are no weekends off. They also need to deal with nature. Changes in weather like droughts and storms, and also bugs can take out much of what they might have sold; and, there are high prices for fertilizers. Those are the reasons that make their business challenging. However, it is very rewarding for them to see the vegetables grow and be sold to the market.<br \/><br \/>Growing and selling vegetables really helped them sustain their everyday expenses. However, they still need additional capital, which will really help them in their business\u2019 expansion. With this, Merly decided to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan to buy fertilizers and insecticides, since bugs and insects are their biggest struggle aside from storms and drought. <br \/><br \/>Merly regularly meets with her co-fellowship members to share her life\u2019s testimony and experience in the business, and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and listen to the Word of God.

\u201cvariety\u201d. Most Filipinos prefer to have this type of business since it can be managed from the comfort of their own home while earning money and still be with their family. That\u2019s why Althea, a 53-year-old business woman, the wife of Leonardo from Barotac Viejo Iloilo and one of the CCT partners since 2007, established her own sari-sari store. She started it in the year 1975 and has continually managed the business. Althea dreams to have her store expanded to have a wide array of product choices. She is still formulating ways and marketing strategies for the business\u2019 success since this really helped her sustain their daily expenses and other basic needs.\r\n\r\nAlthea believes that CCT will help her fulfill her dream for the store\u2019s expansion someday, so she decided to apply for a 12,000 PHP loan that will really help her buy supplies like bottled drinks, a variety of grocery items, school supplies and other products to add to her business. \r\n\r\nOn a weekly basis, Althea regularly meets with her co-fellowship members to share her life\u2019s testimony, experience in the business, and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and listen to the Word of God. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 members. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social relationship with other partners, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1942342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a variety of grocery items, school supplies and other products.

She currently handles a direct-selling business. She started with a small capital buying her first products. Because of her steadfast determination, she has now earned the trust of her customers. Although there are times that she struggles when there are delayed payments, she still works hard because she believes that such situations are an inevitable part of handling a business.\r\n\r\nShe sells different kinds of products, mostly personal product such as soaps, lotion, perfumes and the like. The profit she gets from the business becomes a great help for their family in terms of their daily expenses. \r\n\r\nMichelle is a typical mother with a typical dream for her children. There is nothing more that she hopes for than for her children to gain a better quality of education and to have college degrees. \r\n\r\nThis is the reason that Michelle wants to further improve her resources. If you would allow, she wants to ask for a 15,000 PHP loan, which she will use to buy more products to sell. With this, she can surely gain more income; part of which will be saved for future investments and part of which will be used for their everyday living.  \r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll be a great blessing in advance.

Together they work hand-in-hand to run their business which they just started last year in 2014. Being a fisherman is not an easy task. Rodel\u2019s day begins at dawn when it is still chilly and dark. When he is in the middle of the sea, he begins to let down his net hoping for a good catch. Now and then he pulls his net into the boat. Sometimes the net is loaded with fish, prawns and crabs, but at other times, the net is empty. When Rodel reaches the shore, Roselyn helps him sort out the fish and prawns which are of different types and sizes. After sorting the catch, Roselyn takes them to the market to be sold.\r\n\r\nAt times, the catch is not enough. To help sustain the business, Roselyn would like to apply for a 12,000 PHP loan. She will use that amount to buy materials needed for the repair and maintenance of their pumpboat. A portion of the loan will also be used to purchase fish products which she will sell in addition to the fish and prawns that her husband will catch.\r\n\r\nEventually, Roselyn and Rodel are planning to acquire an additional pumpboat. Also, they are planning to add dried fishes for their customers to have a variety of fish products to choose from. Roselyn and Rodel have one child. They dream that through their hard work and dedication to their business, they will be able to sustain their child\u2019s needs in school and will later become a professional.\r\n\r\nRoselyn regularly meets with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. All CCT Community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Meet Listari, one of Ruma's agents who lives in Bekasi, the satellite city located at the east of Jakarta. Listari is happily married, and she and her husband have been blessed with two cute daughters. Her main source of income comes from the small stall she manages that sells snacks, drinks, and mobile phone airtime credits. It was Ruma field staff who introduced her to Ruma. She decided to join Ruma by selling mobile phone airtime credits to her surrounding community.

He is entrepreneurial, independent, steadfast, patient, responsible and hard working. He does his work in the \u2018Sacaba\u2019 location. This area is preferred for its charming natural valley\u2019s. It boasts mesmerizing and unique characteristics like its climate and tourist attractions. \r\n\r\nIt is located 13 kilometers from the city at an altitude that varies between 2600 and 4500 meters above sea level. It has a temperate climate year round with daytime temperatures varying between 15-28 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nOscar is dark skinned and short with brown eyes, short black hair and a thin physique. His mother tongue is Quechua which he speaks in his area and he speaks Spanish because of the general culture and the work he does. He lives his life alone. He lives in his own home built from bricks and cement with a corrugated iron roof and dirt floors. It has electricity and well water, extracted using a pump. It does not have a sewage system. \r\n\r\nHe works transporting fruit and vegetables from the countryside to the city. He does this work every day of the week during daytime hours. The area where he lives never had potable water because it is a remote and rural area. A while ago, the national government decided to bring the potable water connections to this place. He says: \u201cWell water is dirty and not fit for consumption. We also use river water to wash our clothing.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe advantage of this area is that it already has potable water. The disadvantage is the lack of capital for installing potable water in his kitchen, bathroom and wash room. His dream is to have potable water in his home. He wishes to install potable water in his kitchen, bathroom and wash room to fulfill his dream of using potable water. This is his 1st loan sequence with the institution in the 6 years he has been building his home.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Oscar requests a loan to install potable water in his kitchen, bathroom and wash room for his family\u2019s wellbeing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1938550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to install potable water in his kitchen, bathroom and wash room for his family\u2019s wellbeing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-07-31T05:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-30T05:00:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Oscar David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-23T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-05T04:00:00Z","amount":46.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T04:00:00Z","amount":62.15},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T04:00:00Z","amount":70.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T04:00:00Z","amount":68.07},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T04:00:00Z","amount":68.34},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T04:00:00Z","amount":73.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T04:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T04:00:00Z","amount":74.56},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T04:00:00Z","amount":78.42},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T04:00:00Z","amount":79.08},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T04:00:00Z","amount":78.9},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T04:00:00Z","amount":83.49},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T04:00:00Z","amount":83.59},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T04:00:00Z","amount":85.5},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T04:00:00Z","amount":88.18},{"due_date":"2016-11-07T04:00:00Z","amount":88.17},{"due_date":"2016-12-05T04:00:00Z","amount":93.27},{"due_date":"2017-01-05T04:00:00Z","amount":93.64},{"due_date":"2017-02-06T04:00:00Z","amount":95.32},{"due_date":"2017-03-06T04:00:00Z","amount":99.11},{"due_date":"2017-04-05T04:00:00Z","amount":100.54},{"due_date":"2017-05-05T04:00:00Z","amount":102.77},{"due_date":"2017-06-05T04:00:00Z","amount":104.89},{"due_date":"2017-07-05T04:00:00Z","amount":108.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.07},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.34},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.56},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.42},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.08},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.9},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.49},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.59},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.5},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.18},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.17},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.27},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.64},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.32},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.11},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.54},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.77},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.89},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.24,"local_amount":46.24,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:48Z","rounded_local_amount":46.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711469067},{"amount":1953.76,"local_amount":1953.76,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1953.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296900}],"funded_date":"2015-08-28T23:25:16Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hasmin Sherwin"}},{"id":924323,"name":"Ziyoratsho","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ziyoratsho is a hardworking man.

Meet Nur, one of Ruma's agents who lives in Bekasi, the satellite city located in the east of Jakarta. Nur is happily married. Her main source of income comes from the small stall she manages that sells snacks, drinks, some daily consumer products, and mobile phone airtime credits. It was Ruma field staff who introduced her to Ruma. She decided to join Ruma by selling mobile phone airtime credits to her surrounding community. Nur has a good track record as an agent now since her customers are people in a semi-urban area who are in need of access to such services. As the business runs, Nur hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva that will be used to process more mobile airtime, especially on the weekends. In the near future, she plans to add more products from Ruma to the services she provides, such as e-commerce for low income communities, Ruma's latest product, called Mapan. Nur is the one who is seen in the photo. She thanks you for your kind support.
