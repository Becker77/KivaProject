He has a lot of receivables from his neighbors in Santa Barbara, Iloilo. Many of his debtors pay after several weeks or months and he cannot force them because there are times when money is really difficult to earn. It\u2019s a good thing that he has an alternative source of income, which is his tricycle. His wife, Eva, looks after the store while he is driving his tricycle. His income somehow sustains their everyday needs and educational expenses of his two young children. But he still aims to improve his variety store so it can earn enough to prepare for his children\u2019s higher education. As much as possible, he wants to save early for the future. A PHP 40,000 loan would be very helpful for him to buy additional stock of dry goods and grocery items for his store and part of it will be used to pay for his tricycle\u2019s maintenance. You can be the answer to his prayers through your generous support.

He is married to Malou and they are blessed with two young children.<br \/><br \/>Ryan has been running a catering service for five years now. At times when there\u2019s no catering scheduled, he sells fish in the town\u2019s public market. He experiences many challenges in relation to his catering business. He suffers from lack of sleep as he has to get up early to buy the necessary ingredients. He endures the heat while cooking and defies his throbbing body pain after every day of work. Yet he focuses on his goal of providing for their everyday needs and saving for the future and for the education of his children. He also plans to buy a service vehicle for efficient operation of his business. He is expanding his network of customers and offering catering services to them. He knows that it\u2019s best for him to have as many clients as possible even if there might be two or more occasions or catering requests at the same time. It would bring him more profit. His only problem is the limited utensils, equipment, tables and chairs to be used for simultaneous occasions. He humbly requests a PHP 50,000 loan to buy all these things. He may also need to hire occasional waiters and helpers. Hope you could be God\u2019s instrument to grant his request and contribute a few steps to make his dreams come true someday. <br \/><br \/>Ryan draws inspiration from his co-fellowship* members who meet every week to share stories of their life and business and to draw strength from the Word of God. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":687.52,"image":{"id":1942367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for additional utensils, equipment, tables and chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Santa Barbara, Iloilo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-31T06:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-30T06:30:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":275.04,"local_amount":12499.98,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":12510.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434288},{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":10416.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":10425.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955206},{"amount":183.32,"local_amount":8333.32,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":8340.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045050}],"funded_date":"2015-08-25T15:10:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":924276,"name":"Fritzesa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Fritzesa works hard to support her family.<br \/><br \/>She has a general store business in the Philippines, and earns additional income from farming vegetables.

People want to wear new clothes, undergarments, footwear and use new cosmetics as well, especially girls in the line. With this mere fact, it is a very great opportunity for entrepreneurs to enter this kind of industry. Relative to this, direct selling is highly in demand especially for smaller people troops like Luisa, 64 years of age, from Pasay City Philippines. <br \/><br \/>Starting in 2005, she has engaged in direct selling. Peeking in, what she basically does is sell various products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, and others. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are getting as their income. <br \/><br \/>For now, Luisa envisions making her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. At an amount of PHP 15,000, she can already purchase more merchandise products to sell like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products that are needed to increase her product inventory. This can also be a stepping stone for her to gradually expand her current business. <br \/><br \/>Luisa dreams of growing her business into a more profitable source of income so that she can pass it on someday to her children. She also hopes to earn more for her grandchildren\u2019s education. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":218.78,"image":{"id":1942334,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more merchandise products to sell that would help increase her product inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-31T06:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-30T06:40:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.54,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3980.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434278},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2653.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955196},{"amount":72.9,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3317.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045040}],"funded_date":"2015-08-01T15:20:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":924277,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"They say there\u2019s money from garbage.

When he was a child, he helped his father and when he became an adult, he continued with the family business, opening his own store 23 years ago. With consistency and perseverance, Roberto has managed to get his family life ahead, though he says that the most difficult part of this business is the sacrifice of free time since he needs to be available for his customers from 6:00 am to 9:30 pm all week long, and it is difficult to take care of the family's recreation needs. But, seeing his customers happy becomes the best reward. Roberto says that his working capital is not enough to keep his daily stock of fruits and vegetables and to get a cooler that he needs to keep the perishable foods. His vision for the future is to get sufficient profits to open other sales locations which will allow him to improve his quality of life and offer his daughter a good education.

Growing crops is one of the key sectors of agriculture, comprising the growing of crops for food use for the population, feed for animal rearing, and raw materials for many other industrial sectors. Zuhra plants the crops herself, looks after the grain and vegetable seedlings, gathers the harvest, sells it, and also uses it as food for her own family. Thanks to her hard work, her family does not want for anything. Zuhra has already planted her new crop, but she did not have enough money to buy mineral fertilizer. She has applied for a loan with high hopes, and believes that she will be supported so that her family will not be left without food this year."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1943337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy mineral fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Qurgan-Tube","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-07-31T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-30T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zuhra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-28T19:29:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":924422,"name":"Maridel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maridel is a married woman with nine children.

Each member's business has grown significantly due to the intelligent investments made possible by the loans received from Kiva.\r\n\r\nThe trust bank is comprised of 10 aspiring women who aim to increase the inventories of their various small businesses which include corner stores, shoe stores, huipils embroidery, weaving, the sale of typical clothing, and the rearing and sale of animals. \r\n\r\nNow, after much success from the previous loan, the trust bank \u201cCelestial\u201d is asking for another loan to continue their development. One of the women asking for a loan is Zoila, a delightful 44-year-old member of the group. Zoila is the owner of a corner store in which she sells goods used for daily consumption. With the new loan she receives, Zoila hopes to purchase more goods that have been asked for by her clients, such as sugar, eggs, beans, chicken feed, salt, and a variety of other supplies. Zoila has also been able to further invest her profits to obtain more capital and to educate her  children. She has 7 children, but only 3 of them are studying. \r\n\r\nThank you, Kiva investors, for the continuous support that you have given through the loans you provide.

She is married and has two children. She applied to Arvand initially when she learned of the possibility to get financial support. Muazam and her family live in a rural location. She does not have a higher education since she was not able to study at university due to her family's financial difficulties. Muazam grows crops in order to have income to buy food. Her son is away working in Russia. He helps his parents when he is able. Muazam's husband buys and sells crops.<br \/><br \/>Now Muazam is going to marry off her granddaughter.

","en":"Aichurok successfully repaid her loan after using it as intended. She is grateful to the Kiva fund and everyone who had helped her with the financing. Aichurok's farm currently has 10 cows, 20 sheep and 2 horses. She grows alfalfa on 2.0 hectares of land.

She is married to Guadencio, a seaman, and a mother to her two elementary children. A year ago, Wilma thought of putting up a \"Piso Net\" business.\r\n\r\nWilma manages her own Computer Shop. \"Piso Net\" is a combination of PC rental and Arcade rental services wherein customers can use the services by inserting  a Peso coin to the machine. There is an increasing need for services like these in the Philippines as not everyone has Personal Computers at home. Her main patrons are students who do their school requirements. There is also an increased need to rent computers for business purposes like writing a resume, any office documentation and just the desire and hobby to surf the net and any social network. One can also play games in the renter computer. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 50000 loan. She will use the loan to buy additional Piso Net unit. This will definitely boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings from the Shop helps meet the growing needs of her family.\r\n\r\nWilma dreams to have a bigger \"Piso Net\" Shop. She prays for God's protection for her family especially her husband who works as seaman. She also prays for wisdom for her ministry at churchShe meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1942687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To pay for one Personal Computer for her \"piso net\" business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-07-31T19:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-30T19:40:05Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":586.68,"local_amount":26666.64,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":26688.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434294},{"amount":293.32,"local_amount":13333.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":13344.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955212},{"amount":220,"local_amount":10000.04,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":10008.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045056}],"funded_date":"2015-08-01T00:48:41Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":924762,"name":"Jescyl","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jescyl works hard to support her family.

She has a young mind and positive thoughts.\r\n\r\nProfessional development has become the primary motivation to continue her studies, since with just some effort and personal sacrifice she can open life opportunities that can improve conditions for everyone, in the event of any situation that could be a success for the children.\r\n\r\nDuring her education Bety wants to contribute to the development of her country with the knowledge and skills she has learnt throughout her career as a professional.\r\n\r\nBety remembers that her efforts and carefulness being a successful professional influenced her life, since while she was studying for her degree, she was awarded scholarships for five years, but she managed to finish her studies in four years since she studied a lot and took enough classes to allow her to advance in her academic performance. This is without doubt something Bety and her family are proud of, a clear example of academic preparation for her children.\r\n\r\nFor her future plans, she wants to visit other countries and gain new knowledge and work mechanisms that could be of great help in her work environment.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1938619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She makes enough through her business to contribute in the family income.

In this location, a population of Mayan Kaqchikel people can be observed. Women there maintain their remarkable traditions through their brilliant traditional clothing. Many of the residents of San Lucas live their lives as bean farmers, corn farmers, wholesale and retail vendors, and animal growers.\r\n\r\nRoughly fifteen minutes away from the town, there is a rural community in which you will find a trust bank, which is known as \u201cMujeres Dulces de Xejuyu\u201d, or\u2019 \u201cSweet Women of Xejuyu\u201d. The group, which consists of eight women in total, is asking for its first loan from Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nDeyni, the president of the group, is one of the lucky few who had the opportunity to study until eighth grade. Deyni is married and has two children. One is four years old and the other is seven years old. The loving mother dedicates herself to raising animals such as chickens and pigs, and she is requesting a loan so that she can buy two pigs and a few chickens.

She is happily married to Celso, her business partner and has three children but only one goes to school. \r\n\r\nSusan has been operating her food stand for nine years already. She cooks different kinds of dishes but her specialty is \"lugaw\" (Filipino rice porridge, a plain congee with any kind of meat or seasonings, a favorite among the Filipinos. It is very much a staple in the Phil.cuisine and can be enjoyed as breakfast, as snack and even as main dish. Susan on her long years of running her eatery has already established and growing customers in their area.\r\n\r\nTo help her sustain and grow her eatery she is requesting for a Php 30000 loan to buy several kilos of rice, fresh meat, vegetables like corn and cabbage, noodles and various veggies, seasonings, gas to cook dishes to sell at her food stand. She will be grateful and is thanking you in advance that you could grant her the amount she needs for her business. Her food stand means a lot to her since this is where she gets the funds she need to meet daily needs and school needs of her child.

Terra cotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills. Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing. In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone. With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume.
