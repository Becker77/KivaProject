This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She continues to push on with the help of her loans.

She is very dedicated to her work, which is the sale of sweets, snacks, stickers, etc.  She does this work on a tricycle, as does her husband, outside of schools from Monday to Friday.  \r\n\r\nShe leaves the house at 6:00 in the morning and works until 6 in the evening, when she returns home tired, since she drives her own tricycle while her husband has another and they split up.  \r\n\r\nOur partner was born in the Ecuadoran capital but since her marriage 10 years ago, she has lived in Portoviejo.  She has 4 children, but only one of them lives with her.  The rest live in Quito and are already on their own.  \r\n\r\nAside from tricycle sales, Julissa has another business; a food store which her son watches while she's out.  With this new loan, Julissa will be able to invest in her two businesses and advance them both. During the school year, confectionery sales are very successful and she needs to increase her stock, and the store also needs investment.  \r\n\r\nOur partner is very happy to be able to keep both her businesses stable.  Her dream is to have her own home and stop renting.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Nadine Riopel, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":542696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Candy, gum, potato chips, oil, rice, sugar, soda pop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Ercilia Julisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":193.76,"local_amount":192.51,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":193.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892520},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632866},{"amount":193.76,"local_amount":192.51,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":193.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846900},{"amount":129.18,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":129.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113361},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":64.17,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":64.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406921},{"amount":64.55,"local_amount":64.13,"processed_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":64.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406922}],"funded_date":"2010-06-17T02:28:59Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nadine Riopel","image":496782}},{"id":206389,"name":"Ney","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ney P., 47, is a villager who lives in Chambak Tuem village in Takeo province.

She has also had to reduce the amount of her loans due to the expensive treatment she is receiving for this problem.  <P>\r\n\r\nEven though Andrea is facing tough medical challenges, her zest and determination for her business won\u2019t let anything stop her.  When she has a catering job, she prepares what she can ahead of time from her kitchen in her home, and then she transports everything to the catering location by taxi.  She has a set of pans and appliances that she brings with her to prepare the rest of the food on location, and has four or five people to help her, depending on the size of the catering job.  She prepares a lot of Italian and Chinese food, but the most common is the popular Peruvian \u2018comida Criolla\u2019.  Christmas is a very busy time for her: she receives many requests for cooking Christmas day turkeys, and she can currently prepare six turkeys, for which she charges 60 Soles ($20) a piece.  She would love to have the capability to prepare more!<P>\r\n\r\nAndrea has five children, ages 32, 31, 29, 27, and 25, all now independent and working in Lima.  Andrea\u2019s dream is to expand her kitchen to enable her to prepare more food at once.  She would especially like more counter space and a larger oven.  She is also in the process of designing business cards to hand out and has very creative ideas for her logo!  When asked if the loans help her, her eyes light up and she gives a very enthusiastic \u2018yes!\u2019.  She says they help her immensely, and she is very excited for this loan of $350 to be able to invest in her business cards, more pans, and a blender."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":88445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To invest in business cards, more pans, and a blender.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-24T17:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicita Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-08T18:39:25Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-01-08T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-08T09:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":262.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":112022},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-02-08T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-08T09:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":262.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":131345},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-03-08T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-08T09:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":262.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":153071},{"amount":86,"local_amount":245.71,"processed_date":"2008-04-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-08T09:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":256.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177176}],"funded_date":"2007-11-24T18:39:25Z","paid_date":"2008-04-08T09:10:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":29376,"name":"Khanim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khanim (her husband is pictured) was born in 1957 and is the mother of 3 children.

In this way, she will be able to supply her business with products to later sell at catalogue-price, and generate a greater profit margin.  She will also purchase rice, bananas, potatoes, eggs, breads, crackers, candy, sweets, soda, kekes (andean pastry), frugos, and other products which she needs to cook the dishes she sells.  Judith is 43 years old and is single.  She has always stood out for being a hard-working woman and a good manager.  Her goal is to continue with her business to increase her income and continue ahead.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jordan Shanker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":205371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase on-sale beauty products as well as rice, bananas, potatoes, eggs, breads, crackers, candy, sweets, soda, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huicungo - San Mart\u00edn, Per\u00fa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-09-27T17:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ludith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-11T18:45:02Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T07:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":502.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5330915},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":502.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951285},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":502.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224312},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":502.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417044},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":502.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27110723},{"amount":166.65,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":502.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006123}],"funded_date":"2008-09-27T18:45:02Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:15:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jordan Shanker","image":null}},{"id":70359,"name":"Khalida's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khalida baji is the wife of M.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For the past 15 years she has sold food items from a small store she set up in her home.  Additionally, she prepares food to order or, during coffee harvest time, when many day workers come to work the farms.  She spends most of her time in her store which is open every day.  From 6am on you can find her sweeping the perimeter of her house so that her store will look more attractive.

At the moment, Freddy is renting his home, but he has a small plot of land where he hopes to build a house and provide his family with a better quality of life.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe rest of the group is involved in various business activities.  Most either sell cosmetics or food as traveling vendors or from a permanent location.  In general, the group has enough experience to carry out their businesses.  Others have just recently started their businesses.  While competition continues to increase, the members know how to deal with it and obtain regular customers who appreciate their work and continue to demand their services.  In addition, it is important for the members to show enthusiasm for their work.  This loan will be used as operating capital to buy merchandise, acquire provisions, and repair work equipment.  Their greatest expectation is to have successful businesses in which their hard work and dedication result in an honest improvement in their income.  This will help them provide their families with a better quality of life.  This Communal Bank has limited experience with solidarity loans.  Even though they are just starting their first loan cycle, they have demonstrated in their meetings that they are enthusiastic and eager to succeed.     <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":498830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Operating capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-03-03T11:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margoth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuelita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Freddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aracelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":14500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1740.76},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1760.79},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1781.05},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1801.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1822.28},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1843.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1864.46},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1885.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.97},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.81},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.81},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1013.43,"local_amount":7081.78,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":7114.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945038},{"amount":524.63,"local_amount":3666.11,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3682.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673370},{"amount":0.26,"local_amount":1.79,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707393},{"amount":266.81,"local_amount":1864.46,"processed_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1873,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151890906},{"amount":269.87,"local_amount":1885.86,"processed_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1894.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151890907}],"funded_date":"2010-03-04T14:06:14Z","paid_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":185921,"name":"Albino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Albino tiene 38 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casado y tiene 3 hijos.

He lives in his own house with his wife who is 44 years old, Fermina, and three children. When Juan was young he worked in his father's fields, but 18 years ago he acquired a 3-hectare farm planted in cacao and coffee.  His success stems from his creativity and hard work, and he has benefitted from technical training as well.  Cacao is his most sought-after crop, for the high quality he produces, and generates strong profits.  Juan generally works alone, but in times of harvest he hires day laborers on the farm to gather ripe fruit.  He plans to use this credit to hire workers in the June to November harvest period, allowing him to expand production and better his family's prospects. This is his first credit, and with the 3,000 nuevos soles he will hire workers to clear the fields and bring in the harvest.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":822877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay farm workers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-26T11:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":203.42},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":210.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":221.48},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":226.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":237.15},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":243.2},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250.03},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":266.05},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":274.73},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":278.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":290.69},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":297.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.21},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.02},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.59,"local_amount":203.42,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":204.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350799},{"amount":77.28,"local_amount":210.78,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":211.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851159},{"amount":81.21,"local_amount":221.48,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:13Z","rounded_local_amount":222.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666335},{"amount":83.02,"local_amount":226.42,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":227.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621492},{"amount":86.96,"local_amount":237.15,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:36Z","rounded_local_amount":237.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835565},{"amount":89.17,"local_amount":243.2,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":243.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245325},{"amount":91.68,"local_amount":250.03,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":250.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385431},{"amount":97.55,"local_amount":266.05,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":266.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098554},{"amount":418.54,"local_amount":1141.47,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1145.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712758}],"funded_date":"2011-08-17T20:41:42Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matthew Cassetta","image":260079}},{"id":325244,"name":"Renacer Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 denominado Renacer es de la ciudad de Encarnaci\u00f3n, est\u00e1 integrado por amigas y vecinas de esa ciudad.

She joined One Acre Fund in order to educate them. In the recent 2011 season, Judith had a very good maize yield harvesting 10 bags on half an acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Judith was only able to harvest two bags of maize on that land. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Judith and her group during Kenya's next planting season in February 2012.

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and the alleviation of poverty through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

The business is in a space in her house, which is set up with some tables and chairs.  Fortunately, her oldest daughter helps her prepare the food and wait on the customers.  Tania really likes her work because she feels useful, and she keeps busy.  Also, it is very profitable for her because she is in a key area (final stop for public transportation cars).  Lots of people travel there and various drivers are regular customers.\r\n\r\nIn the near future Tania would like to expand her business and make her own restaurant.  This is her second loan with MFP.  She is very happy to be part of a community bank because all of her colleagues work well together, and they are very responsible with their payments.  She will use the money she is asking for to build an adequate location to sell her food more comfortably.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":376136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Build a place for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-24T17:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":119.01},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125.95},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":130.98},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":135.65},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":141.27},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":147.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.3},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.02},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":119.01,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":121.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081231},{"amount":43.3,"local_amount":125.95,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":128.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997382},{"amount":45.02,"local_amount":130.98,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":133.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842726},{"amount":145.77,"local_amount":424.06,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":431.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734307}],"funded_date":"2009-08-24T18:56:45Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":135957,"name":"Sheba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sheba manages a general store in their village in Calao East, Santiago City.

Laura has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Laura joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Laura has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase breeding livestock. Laura is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell and to purchase feed. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Laura from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from her business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

It is a very joyful group that expects to grow. Ms. Pamela is married and has two children to support, which is her reason to get ahead in life. Her husband is a builder, but at this time he is temporarily unable to work. In the meantime, Ms. Pamela has to support the family with her small pastry stand, delivering her goods to schools and candy stands. She is a very positive person who will be able to help her family move forward by providing her children with a home and a good education. The other group members either sell handicrafts, baked goods, fast food, or they sew clothing for a living. There exists a lot of competition at the market where the members work, but they have an edge in the speed at which they can rotate and stock up on their goods. They always follow the market rules and meet seasonal demands. This loan will primarily be used as working capital so that they can have their own fixed stand and a steady income in the not-so-distant future. The majority of the group members have experience working with microfinance institutes as they are currently in their second loan cycle with us, so they know how to manage their capital and funds well. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Love D., 34, believes life to be so. Love reached college and is married to Richard; together, they have three children, two of whom are in elementary school, while the third one is not yet of school age.  They presently live in Caloocan City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nLove is in the direct--sales business. She sells silver accessories like necklaces, earrings, and rings to friends, neighbors, and business connections. Being eight years in business, Love uses knowledge based on experience and applies her learning from training in CCT* to make her business grow. Every month she earns around Php 8,250.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She intends to use this money to buy more silver accessories as well as products from the well-known beauty brand AVON in order to give her customers more options. She will also use the money to be able to deliver new orders to customers as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nOne challenge Love faces is that she cannot immediately get new orders and deliver them to customers since many of them do not pay their bill as soon as they get their previously ordered items. She then does not have sufficient money on hand to obtain new orders. However, Love finds ways to solve the problem and to make sure that finances in her business flow smoothly. Focusing on the silver lining of every cloud that comes her way, Love is determined to get a commercial space for her business. She continually prays for God's intervention in her life and in the life of her family, so that her children will be able to finish college and have a bright future.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance

She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.<p>\r\n\r\nThe operator of a rug-making business, Rowena mainly offers rugs, from those round palm sized ones, to the much larger doormats, braided quilts and bed sheets, and other crafts that most rug-makers sell. Rugs, a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, are some of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from peddler selling from the side of the highway. Rowena also earns additional income from the direct-selling of products. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community, and she earns a minimum of Php300 in sales everyday.<p>\r\n\r\nTo help her continue business operations, she is requesting a Php9, 000 loan to buy more raw materials such as fabrics, threads, etc. for her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  <p>\r\n\r\nRowena hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of giving all her children a good and high quality education through all of her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.<p>\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her family has faced serious financial difficulties ever since her husband passed away at an early age, leaving her to raise five young children alone.  In the previous lending cycle, she used a loan to buy breeding hens and then sold off the additional chickens produced.  The profit from that enterprise, 500,000 VND (30 USD), she set aside to pay for her children\u2019s education.  In this lending cycle, she hopes to borrow 2,442,600 VND (~145 USD) to buy breeding hens again, as well as fertilizer for her rice field. \r\nThe other members of the group are requesting the same amount.\r\nMrs. C.

He is a very noble man, living in his own home together with his beloved wife who gave him four children. Of them, the eldest are attending school in the city and the youngest go to the community school. For more than 27 years he has been harvesting potatoes, sweet potatoes and wheat on rented fields. During these years he gathred agricultural experience, such as the seasons of the year to better prioritize the kinds of harvest of the time of year. This ultimately translates to the success of his harvests, but although he has this experience, he doesn't always enjoy large harvests. He constantly tends to and looks after his harvests, to immediatley know when it's time to fumigate against any pests.  Teofilo loves his harvests, especially because it has been many years since he's lost out. Sometimes he exports to other cities and this helps him increase his earnings even more. With savings he managed to purchase more land where he continuously increases his plantations. This is his third loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner), and during these loan periods he has always been on time with his payments. For this new loan he promises to show the same responsibility. He feels so happy to belong to a community bank, from where he is borrowing the funds. With the seven hundred neuvos soles requested, he will purchase insecticides to fumigate his harvests agains mosquitoes that damange the leaves from the potato and pea plants. (In the photo he can be seen wearing his fumigation gear).<\/p>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva

She has a small  grocery store that she installed in her house, where she sells basic foods, such as eggs noodles, rice, milk, bread, etc., as well as drinks.  She has been engaged in this activity for two years, attending her business everyday at whatever hour of the day.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat Gina likes most about her store is that it enables her to  have contact with many people and give them good service.  Moreover, it keeps her occupied and makes her feel very useful.  Besides, it is a profitable business, since it is the only store where she lives.\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, Gina owns a motor car, which also generates good daily income.

However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of Kes 49,000 to buy more clothes to expand her business and meet the demands of her customers, especially during this festive season. In future, she hopes to open a bigger boutique. She describes herself as an ambitious lady.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":671350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.283333 34.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":138,"posted_date":"2010-12-20T17:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.08,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":49000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5444.44},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5444.44},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5444.44},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5444.44},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5444.44},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5444.44},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5444.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5444.44},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":5444.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":5445,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5576.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191488769},{"amount":69.45,"local_amount":5445,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5576.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195916912},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":5445,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:27:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5576.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201488828},{"amount":69.45,"local_amount":5445,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:47:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5576.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206225321},{"amount":138.89,"local_amount":10890,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-25T08:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":11153.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217713018},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":5445,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5576.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221893897},{"amount":136.76,"local_amount":10721.98,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10981.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227253817},{"amount":2.05,"local_amount":163.02,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":166.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.08,"payment_id":232880985}],"funded_date":"2010-12-20T22:35:27Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T10:12:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":263804,"name":"Myasar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myasar from Marka, Amman is a young 23-year-old entrepreneurial woman.

is a married woman who lives in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu.  She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: Guitar Making, Sari-sari (general) store and food vending businesses.  Her husband Gregorio A., who is 51 years old years old, works as a Guitar Maker to earn his living. They have 8 children who are 17 to 30 years old - 4 of them have their own family, 3 employed children to help the family and 1 is currently going to school.  \r\n\r\nApolinaria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Apolinaria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 34,000 PHP, thus increasing the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing 13,000 PHP which she intends to use as more funds for her business operations so that she could continue to save up for the future, education of her child and for home repairs.  \r\n\r\nApolinaria is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.  \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

She is married and has a son who is currently abroad.  Paulina lives with her husband, her daughter-in-law, and her three granddaughters.  She and her husband work together selling crab meat.  Paulina started working 20 years ago back when her husband was a taxi driver.  They were not earning enough household income, but she knew a friend who was in this type of business.  Now she has several customers, including restaurants and markets, and sells to them in bulk quantities.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, Paulina will buy more crabs so that she can improve her earnings.

His greatest wish is complete his professional training and buy a car both for personal use and to transport products to the towns of Puno and Urubamba.\r\n\r\nHe is grateful for this opportunity to obtain a loan and promises to repay it according to the schedule.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":508813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-03-19T00:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cesar Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":353.24},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":367.37},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":382.06},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":397.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.52},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.7},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.65,"local_amount":353.59,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:28Z","rounded_local_amount":365.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128906079},{"amount":134.84,"local_amount":367.74,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":379.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633560},{"amount":285.51,"local_amount":778.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":804.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851637}],"funded_date":"2010-03-19T03:15:08Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":190066,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma P. is from the village of Kandiis, Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental.

She lives with her husband, her husband\u2019s second wife and their children, as a polygamous family, in the Darsalam II district in the Koutiala prefecture. Mrs. Adiaratou did not have an opportunity to go to school, and this is why she started learning a business from her mother at an early age. After trying several commercial activities, she has settled on purchasing and reselling \u201cwax\u201d clothing [made of traditional colorful fabrics], which she has been practicing for more than 20 years now. Her business is popular, and she receives many orders each month.\r\n\r\nIn order to grow her business and better satisfy customer demand, she wasted no time in joining the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. She has been a member for two years and had four solidarity (group) loans, all of which were duly repaid. She is now on her first individual loan.\r\nShe purchases her stock from the vendors at the big market of Bamako (the capital of Mali) and often in Koutiala; she plans to purchase ten sets of \u201cwax\u201d fabric.\r\nShe sells her wares in the town of Koutiala as well as at the weekly markets in neighboring towns, on credit or for cash. She plans to achieve a monthly income of 75,000 West African Francs, which she intends to use to repay her loan interest to Soro Yiriwaso and contribute to the everyday family expenses.

They have four children between the ages of 8 and 16.  Mar\u00eda has two businesses, one selling fish and the other selling general merchandise.  Both of these activities are her main sources of income.\r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda Teresa is a very organized woman.  She began selling fish with her husband when she was 16 years old.  Mar\u00eda worked as a street merchant, selling to employees who worked at an industrial park called PINZA that was located in her town.  At the time, she transported the fish in polystyrene coolers.  Her main customers were neighbors, relatives, and friends.  She even resorted to borrowing her mother-in-law\u2019s refrigerator.  As her family slowly grew, so did the number of other needs that she had to fulfill.  It was around that time that she talked with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo about applying for a loan.  In 2004, she received a loan from the organization in the amount of 900,000 COP which she used to boost her business.  Later she received another loan for 1,300,000 COP, and then a third loan for 1,500,000 COP, and finally an additional loan that was also worth 1,500,000 COP.  All of the funds were invested into her business with great discipline.  Using the earning she had saved, she was able to buy a plot of land and became eligible to apply for a new loan which she used to build her house.  Her housing loan has since been repaid completely.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her sixth loan.  She will buy a refrigerator where she can store her fish when she is not working.  With the rest of the money, she will pay for merchandise that she has ordered and purchase a canoe since she belongs to a family of fishermen.  Her husband is a member of the Nuevo Amanecer fishing cooperative and fishes in the lagoon in Malambo, which is near where many businesses are located.  They have a canoe that is in disrepair, so they need another one.  At the moment, Mar\u00eda buys her fish from other fishermen and then sells it at a higher price.  \r\n<p>\r\nSince participating in the programs offered by Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, Mar\u00eda has been able to build up enough capital to continue her business and make improvements to her living conditions.  She dreams of finishing all of the adjustments she has to make for her family to live a healthy life and for her children to have a secure future.  Her greatest challenge occurs in winter when her fish sales decline because she does not go out to sell.  With her other business, she is able to sell different merchandise to the same customers who buy fish from her.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":575259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a refrigerator for storing fish, a fishing canoe for her husband, and merchandise for her second business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-07-28T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria  Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":112285},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":115823},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":117754},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":119716},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":121712},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":123740},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125802},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":127899},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":130031},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":132198},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":134401},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":138639}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.76},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.76},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.85},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.06},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.19},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.52},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.71},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.92},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":61.76,"local_amount":112285,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":114867.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117140},{"amount":128.46,"local_amount":233577,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":238949.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550663},{"amount":65.85,"local_amount":119716,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":122469.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688269},{"amount":66.94,"local_amount":121712,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T09:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":124511.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427498},{"amount":137.25,"local_amount":249542,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":255281.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288920},{"amount":288.49,"local_amount":524529,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":536593.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673198},{"amount":76.25,"local_amount":138639,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":141827.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325128}],"funded_date":"2010-07-28T22:02:51Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":222839,"name":"Qabil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Qabil A. is 45 years old.

Cecilia has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Cecilia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cecilia has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI. This previous loan was used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. Cecilia is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to make further repairs to a transport vehicle used in the business. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Cecilia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":687107,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

He lives with Nancy Berrocal, 26, and from this relationship has 2 children: Annie, 4, and Rebeca,1. They all live together in their own home in the community of Santa Rosa in the department of Ayacucho.  Aurelio is a hardworking man who strives to provide his family with prosperity.  He is a farmer who has 4 hectares of land where he cultivates coca leaves, cocoa and coffee.  He has worked for 13 years, and states that he still enjoys this work, since he can work independently.  During the harvest season he hires workers to help him harvest the cocoa and coca leaves, products that are purchased by the wholesale companies that give him good profits.  What he considers to be most difficult is to move the products from the harvest to the drying area.

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and three children. She says that her most difficult challenge is to travel to other cities.\r\n\r\nAlejandrina is excited to be taking her second loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and increased her business. \r\n\r\nShe plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying goods for daily meals. She operates a Colmado (a small food store). She will use the profits to reinvest in her business and to save because she wants to build a house. She is dreaming of having her own safe structure and living tranquilly with her family. In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoying her business.\r\n\r\nAlejandrina's story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti.
