She is a resident of GMA, Cavite, Philippines. Married to Jonathan, an OFW, and blessed with six children of which two are in high school, and four are in the elementary level. Raising six children in a developing country is a big challenge for most Filipinos. Couples like Cristina's find ways and means to provide for their daily needs.\r\n\r\nCristina has had a fruit shake business for seven years. She buys several flavors of powdered fruit to make fruit shakes such as bananas, mango, buco pandan, strawberry and melon shakes. Being a tropical country with humid weather, a fruit shake business is a surefire income generator. It is a big help to send her six children to school.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Cristina is requesting for an PHP 10000 loan to buy several powdered fruit flavor juice to make her fruit shakes at her fruit stand. She will is thanking God for the financial help that will be given her and a good return on her investment since it will surely cover their daily sustenance and fund her children's schooling.\r\n\r\nCristina hopes that her business will continue to be successful so she could save money to buy a lot for her future house.

He is single and lives in the city of Soroca. He graduated from vocational school in Drochia. Upon learning that the ancient keep in Soroca will be renovated, he decided to open a tourism business. On May 16, 2015 Soroca Fortress opened its doors to visitors, and Alexandru opened a souvenir kiosk right outside the fortress. At the kiosk you can buy souvenirs, T-shirts with a photo of Soroca Fortress, souvenir coins (which were minted on the site). Also there is a small shooting range, where one can shoot a crossbow and bow. Every day, Alexandru serves about 100-300 tourists from Moldova and other countries. In the future, he plans to make 2 sets of armor, with a sword, mace, spear and bow. He will hire two guys to work. The guys will be dressed in armor and with weapons in their hands. To do all of this, Alexandru needs money, so he is asking for this loan. This loan will help development this business and create jobs for young people."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":265.64,"image":{"id":1943697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tourism","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy two sets of medieval armor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MD","country":"Moldova","town":"Soroca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":413,"posted_date":"2015-08-01T02:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-31T02:40:06Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexandru","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MDL","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2017-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2017-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2017-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2017-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.82},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.82},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.82},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.82},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":132.82,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2510.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731043947},{"amount":132.82,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2510.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752132959}],"funded_date":"2015-08-02T02:29:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":924875,"name":"Peruth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peruth aged 36, lives in kololo-Kyangwali, She is like most women who had viable business ideas but not enough capital to start her dream retail business.

Pedro's dream is to have a good quality of life and that his children have better opportunities in the future.\r\n\r\nPedro wants to carry out some work that is necessary to convert his coffee plantation to organic such as planting live barriers to conserve the ground.

In addition, converting to organic will enable him to sell his coffee in better markets.\r\n\r\nPedro has already prepared the land, and now he needs a loan to buy lemongrass seeds, pay for the labor costs, buy organic fertilizer for his coffee plantation, buy organic coffee plants, and buy other materials that are necessary for the conversion to organic.\r\n\r\nA loan will help Pedro to earn more income from his coffee, and also it will help him to earn extra income by diversifying his farm. With the profits earned from selling his organic coffee and diversifying his farm, Pedro hopes for a better quality of life and better opportunities for his family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1939606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy organic fertilizer and to plant live barriers that are necessary to convert his coffee plantation to organic.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Pedro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":448,"posted_date":"2015-08-01T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-08-31T14:00:03Z","loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Antorio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":33,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20128.8},{"due_date":"2017-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20336.08},{"due_date":"2018-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":19535.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":922.57},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":932.07},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":895.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-17T17:50:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christopher Redmond","image":null}},{"id":919961,"name":"Anita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anita's greatest motivation in life is to provide her children with proper education.

Her husband runs a small roadside tea stall, which is the only income-generating source for the family. Anita is a housewife and responsible mother and handles both responsibilities carefully. \r\n\r\nAnita's daughter, 14-year-old Poli, is a student of grade 9 at Dhupguri Girl's High School. She was promoted to class 9, securing average marks in all subjects. Possibly the reason behind this is a lack of guidance as well as adequate study materials. Anita cannot help her daughter in her studies with her limited education. Moreover, striving for basic needs does not allow Anita to provide all the necessary materials for her daughter' education. \r\n\r\nThe annual session usually starts just after the festival season ends, and that leaves a financial issue for a family whose income is irregular and meager. Borrowing from moneylenders was the only option available to let her daughter pursue her studies. Then she came to know about Kiva education loans from a friend of hers. Her anxiety to provide an education to her daughter has been helped by Kiva and BJS providing an education loan. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she is going to provide school fees, a set of school uniforms, textbooks, stationery supplies, and tuition fees for the whole year for her daughter.  She is so happy that her daughter can attend the school and not worry about the examination fees and others.

Her daughter is pursuing her bachelor degree, her son is in grade 8, and one of her daughters got married. \r\n\r\nBulan's daughter Punam is 18 years old. She is pursuing her bachelor degree from Bardhaman college in business management; she is in first year. She needs proper guidance and reference books to score good marks in her examination. Bulan's husband is engaged with house painting work. His income is mostly spent on household expenses, and they cannot afford the whole education cost of their children. Sometimes they cannot even provide necessary books for their children. As such, providing her (Punam) with private coaching is too difficult for them to bear. \r\n\r\nSo to solve this problem Bulan applied for an educational loan from BJS (Kiva's partner). The loan amount will be utilized for purchasing her daughter's necessary books, pay all college fees and for enrolling her in private coaching class.

One of the obstacles facing them each day is that their community does not have electricity. \r\n\r\nSantos has decided to request a loan from Soluz Honduras in order to buy a solar energy system. Until now, the only way of keeping light in their home has been to use candles and kerosene lamps, which cause serious health problems and are expensive. A solar energy system is necessary for Santos in order to improve the quality of life of his family and let them carry out their household tasks.

is a married woman of 31 years. She lives with her husband, Sudhindra, in the small village of Jogendrapur in Falakata with three sons, who are all students in different grades at the local village school. \r\n\r\nSaharari\u2019s husband has been engaged in agriculture for many years. He cultivates different crops and sells the gathered harvest in the local markets. Now they have thought of cultivating a crop which is profitable and in demand in all seasons. They have decided to grow chili on their farmland because chili is eaten cooked or raw for its fiery hot flavor in almost all Indian dishes. Having inadequate capital, they decided to seek some financial help for this cultivation.

He is kind to all those in his household. <br \/><br \/>Amara's main activity is fattening cattle, that is, he buys cattle at Nara, and then he immediately cares for them and provides them veterinary care.  Sometimes he buys cows that produce milk. He sells the milk the cows give to customers and that allows him to cover small expenses for his family. Amara resells the cattle to buyers, both rural and urban, and he can make a profit of 100,000 F CFA per animal.

Most people who live in this area are smallholder farmers. Stephen has been practicing farming on a small inherited piece of land for the past six years. He believes in the slogan \"Unity is strength\", which is why he decided to join Mutua Boda Boda self-help group. \r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Stephen has been actively involved in mixed farming. He never got the chance to get a white collar job but this has not been a setback. He has been practicing crop farming, but he has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements such as fertilizers, seeds and tools. He is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements, such as high-quality seeds, good fertilizer, and pesticides that he will use to greatly improve his crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure him of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels.

Her children range in age from two to twenty-five; four of them go to school. She raises sheep and her husband farms cattle.\r\n\r\nMa\u00efmouna is turning to RMCR to buy more sheep and goat for her business, so she can earn a lot more. She has been in this business for thirteen years.\r\n\r\nMa\u00efmouna is illiterate, which is why she cares about sending her children to school. Thanks to the profits it make possible, the loan helps her to pay for the family\u2019s expenses and the cost of her children\u2019s education. Her purchases and sales take place at the market in Kimparana as well as in her town, in cash. She makes a monthly profit of 12,500 XOF after expenses.\r\n\r\nThe challenges Ma\u00efmouna has to face are that cattle feed can become a bit expensive at the market, and that the animals sometimes die."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1939356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy animals for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kimparana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":438,"posted_date":"2015-08-02T01:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-01T01:00:05Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata S","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna G","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djamako","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tako","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan Dite Nangagon ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan L","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1250000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-26T11:49:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlotte Buecheler","image":566239}},{"id":925133,"name":"Dominic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dominic is 38 years old.

Working for herself has always been a goal, and this year she completed the necessary education and certifications to start her own bookkeeping business.
