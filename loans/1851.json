This was true for Zachary, 33, who is based in the Chuka area of Kenya. He has now been practicing mixed farming for the past five years and has managed to earn a decent income. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business he engages in to make ends meet. He passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, he stated, \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d His hobby is milking his cow. He sells milk to his neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and he cannot meet it. <br \/><br \/>For this reason, he is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that he plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This extra production will immediately translate to more profit margins and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used to repay the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase his business enterprise. <br \/><br \/>Zachary is very visionary, and he intends that in the near future, he will start adding value to his milk business through packaging the milk before selling it, and he also plans to start selling dairy products such as yogurt and cream. An improved income level will assure his family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, he will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets.<br \/><br \/>Like Zachary, thousands of smallholder farmers are hoping for your help; please make a loan."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1938983,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy another quality dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-02T05:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-01T05:50:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zachary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4300.81},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4426.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4555.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4689.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4826.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4967.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5112.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5261.66},{"due_date":"2016-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5415.43},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5573.7},{"due_date":"2016-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5736.59},{"due_date":"2016-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5904.24},{"due_date":"2016-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6076.79},{"due_date":"2016-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6254.38},{"due_date":"2016-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6437.17},{"due_date":"2016-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6625.3},{"due_date":"2016-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6818.92},{"due_date":"2017-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":7018.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.89},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.12},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.62},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.74},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.37},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.04},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.54},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.25},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.19},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":925451,"name":"Ginaline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ginaline is engaged in a direct selling business.

He wakes up every day to go to work and care for his land. This is a skill that he learned on his own and, little by little, has perfected his techniques and abilities in this field.

He knows that many people consume his farm products, and because of this, he makes sure his products are pure and of good quality. <br \/><br \/>He is a 29-year-old farmer from Kipsaiya village, situated in the Rift valley province of Kenya. He lives with his wife and children on a small piece of land where he keeps cows and grows a wide variety of crops. For 10 years, his primary sources of income have been milk and produce. His biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals, to prevent these diseases. Benard made a decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help him improve his farming activities. <br \/><br \/>Sometime this month, he applied for a loan to buy seeds and expand his horticultural farm. This will enable him to expand his operations to increase the overall output. The additional income from the expansion will go to his children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is increasingly becoming prohibitive to low-income communities, especially in the rural areas. As a result, kids are forced to drop out to start working to contribute their earnings to their families. With your loan, Benard's children will acquire quality education that will act as a strong foundation for their bright future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":22.81,"image":{"id":1942361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy seeds and expand his horticulture farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-02T06:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-01T06:00:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1061.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1092.62},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1124.55},{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1157.4},{"due_date":"2016-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1191.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1226.06},{"due_date":"2016-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1261.89},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1298.77},{"due_date":"2016-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1336.72},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1375.79},{"due_date":"2016-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1416},{"due_date":"2016-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1457.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.62},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.91},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.26},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.62},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.99},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.37},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.76},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.81,"local_amount":2281.12,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2309.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024016}],"funded_date":"2015-08-04T01:51:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":925450,"name":"Dung's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Dung, 43 years old, is a Thai ethnic woman.

This is the first time that they are asking for a loan from Kiva's partner and they came together in order to enter into the group credit program with the guarantee of solidarity since it is difficult for them to obtain personal loans as they don't have collateral without the group.  \r\n\r\nIsabel is one of the active members.  She is 26 years old, the mother of three children, and head of her household.  She is a hard-working woman who is focused on meeting her goals. \r\n\r\nShe is the secretary for the group.  She has experience in sales as a walking saleswoman offering women and men's clothing.  She has joined the group to restart that activity, since she does not have sufficient income to help her children get ahead.  For this reason she is beginning her business, since she has the obligation or economic responsibility for her family.  \r\n\r\nOne of her goals is to improve the living conditions of her family, her own home, and that of her group members.  Along with Isabel there are 8 other women who seek the same objectives in common, and who are going to invest in businesses such as working in a bazaar, selling soda, raising pigs and growing plantains and bananas.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1934890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase clothing for women and men, and to help other small businesses in a bazaar, selling soda, raising pigs and growing plantains and bananas.

This has led Nida to grow ornamental plants and sell them along the highway. \r\n\r\nNida has been in this business for ten years already, growing garden plants that are native to the Philippines like ylang-ylang, golden shower and dahlias, as well as a variety of hanging plants and others. Her regular customers are local tourists, neighbors and the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nTo help her expand her farm, she is requesting a 15,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) loan, which she will use to buy fertilizers and various kinds of garden seedlings to grow beautiful and healthy ornamental plants. She expects a boost to her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God for a good return on her investment and the financial help that will be given to her, for it will surely help meet the family's daily needs and fund her children's education. Although there are days that her sales are low, she continues to trust the Lord that she will have higher sales on other days.\r\n\r\nNida hopes to attract more customers. She aims to send her children to college and see them become professionals someday.

However, due to financial constraints, her husband is not in a suitable position to buy all of these products for the purpose of reselling.

Thanks to a previous Kiva loan through MiCr\u00e9dito, he was able to buy some cows of breed which have already calved, and this has generated incremental business.\r\n\r\nArcadio has now returned to Kiva and MiCredito asking for a loan to cover the expenses associated with the birth of a calf, including veterinary fees, vaccines, medications, vitamins, and more.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Arcadio would like to set up a slaughterhouse and to start production of dairy products."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1939339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay the expenses associated with the birth of a calf.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2015-08-02T14:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-01T14:30:05Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arcadio Jose\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":917.32,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":458.66},{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":458.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":925534,"name":"Milagrosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Milagrosa works hard to support her family.

Thanks to her hard work, her oldest daughter graduated from University and her youngest is studying for a High School Diploma. She herself has only studied up to sixth grade because, being the eldest amongst her siblings, she had to help her parents get by.  Through her hard work she has managed to build a house.  \r\n\r\nAlicia, since she was young, has earned a living from domestic roles. She married later but separated from her husband because he emigrated to the United States.  She continued to strive and now she has a tortilla selling business based in a small shop she is renting in the centre of her community. She had previously started a business selling dairy products but due to health issues she had to give it up. \r\n\r\nShe now works from five in the morning, because she has to go to the mill to grind corn, and finishes at 1pm. At the weekends she earns a living cleaning the homes of different people and she sometimes does this with the help of her daughters. \r\n\r\nAlicia is applying for a loan in order to buy corn, lime and other products to make tortillas.

From this area comes a group made up of ten people who work arduously for the wellbeing of their families.\r\n\r\nThe group members are: Gabriela who works selling cosmetics, Jos\u00e9 and Mar\u00eda who sell soft drinks, Reyna and Marcela who sell traditional snacks, Delfina who sells snacks and cosmetics, Juana and Adriana who sell groceries, Irma who sells silver items, and In\u00e9s who offers carpentry and beauty services.\r\n\r\nIn\u00e9s and her husband V\u00edctor have 20 years at the head of a carpentry workshop.  The key to their success is their dedication and passion to work as a team.  \"Juanita\", as those who know her call her, varnishes, measures, and paints the pieces of furniture that they make day to day in the small workshop they built in their home.  The couple's four children help with the work in the afternoons since in the mornings they go to school.  It fits to mention that two of their children are sponsored by World Vision.  \r\n\r\nIn the same way and with the goal of offering more profit to her family, she has worked as a stylist in the afternoons or by small requests from her customers who recognize her quality and attention.  In this way, with the obtained income, she was able to buy a refrigerator and new stove.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan she is requesting, she will invest in the carpentry workshop by purchasing wood and nails since she must make a dining room table and twelve chairs for a customer.  \"I am happy working with my family and in my two jobs, thanks to the loans I have been granted\" are the words of In\u00e9s who seems very content.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in Juanita and her husband's carpentry workshop, she is seen wearing the yellow blouse and is behind one of the pieces they recently made.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4230,"image":{"id":1934867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood and nails to make furniture.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"ARROYO DE ENMDEDIO ACATLAN DE PEREZ FIGUEROA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-08-02T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-01T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":4700,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delfina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma Miriam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":76000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7600},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7600},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7600},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7600},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":7600},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7600},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":7600},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7600},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":7600},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":7600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":470}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1880,"local_amount":30400,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":30523.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701372},{"amount":940,"local_amount":15200,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:21Z","rounded_local_amount":15261.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204460},{"amount":1410,"local_amount":22800,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":22892.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291881}],"funded_date":"2015-08-03T20:02:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amanda Thur","image":null}},{"id":925632,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph is 58 years old.

Now she is married. Her husband works as a day worker. Together they have nine children, of whom only six are still living and the other three died in the war.\r\n\r\nSince the time when she had small children, Angelina began to sell tortillas, because her husband earned little as a day worker, and her mother encouraged her to begin the business.

She has been involved in land cultivation for many years. Sirun has a greenhouse near their home yard, where she cultivates cucumber, peppers and greens. Because the greenhouse is very old, there are some improvements needed to be made so that Sirun will have a chance to continue land cultivation. She has requested this loan to pay for renovation of the greenhouse, to buy a polyethylene cover for it and to purchase a cow for livestock. <br \/><br \/>This is Sirun's second loan. Unfortunately, the first loan, which she got from a local financial institution previously, was very difficult to pay back, and Sirun faced some difficulties. However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, she and her husband were able to run their agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that they will be able to cover the monthly payments.

This is Josephine. She is the head teacher of Nkumba Primary School, a mixed school in the urban area of Entebbe in Wakiso with 1550 students. Nkumba School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for the students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Nkumba School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

Unfortunately, the first loan, which she got from local financial institutions previously, was very difficult to pay back, and Meline faced some difficulties with her health. However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, she and her husband were able to run their agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that they will be able to cover the monthly payments. <br \/><br \/>Therefore Meline has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.

Perizat has higher education in finance. She has only positive reviews and a good reputation. In 1995, Perizat started working with livestock breeding. From a starting sum of 20,000 som (KGS), Perizat was able to expand her business to get a monthly income of 25,000 som (KGS). Her household currently has a cos and 0.30 hectares of land, where she grows peppers for selling. \n\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Perizat turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 11,000 som (KGS).

He is 36 years old. Avazjon is a man who always thinks about his family. He is married and has three children. Avazjon works as a construction laborer. He and his team built and renovate houses. Because this work is seasonal and during the cold time of the year he is without work, Avazjon has taken the decision to engage in other work in parallel. It is not easy to find work in his parts. Not having found a job, Avazjon is not giving up and is starting his own business. He rears animals. To begin with he will not have much income, but gradually with as his experience grows so too will his income. He is requesting help to buy a few heads of livestock and begin his
