Unfortunately, their salaries are not sufficient to cover all the needs of the family.  At the moment, Nigora and her husband want to renovate their house in order to improve their living conditions, but they don't have the personal resources to do so.  For this reason, Nigora has turned to MDO Arvand; she would like to receive a loan to buy  construction materials in order to provide heat to her house.

She and her husband have two children, aged 19 and 13, who are studying at university and high school. Her husband is a security guard and, some years ago, she studied to be a beautician at a local academy.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela is a very hard-working woman who does everything she can to generate income, so that she can help her husband with the household expenses and the cost of their children's studies. She set up a beauty salon in her house over 10 years ago, where she pffers hair colouring, haircuts and nail painting amongst other services. She works everyday from 8am until 8pm, and sometimes later if her clients require her services.\r\n\r\nShe is going to use this loan to buy nail polish, hair colour and some tools that she needs. This is \u00c1ngela's second loan with the Credit Group; she likes the loan officer's behaviour and the benefits she receives from the foundation.

Among the town\u2019s residents resides a group of women that come together to form the trust bank \u201cOlas de Atitlan\u201d or, \u201cWaves of Atitlan\u201d, who are descendants of the Mayan ethnicity Tz'utujil. The women of the town are known for preserving and wearing their traditional clothing, while the men have kept very little of their traditional typical clothing. <br \/><br \/>At 21 years old, Cervelia, a member of the communal bank, took advantage of the opportunity given to her by her family and has completed 9 years of formal education. Cervelia\u2019s trial to get to this point has engrained hard work in to her life, which has translated to the way she runs her business as the owner of a small meat shop. <br \/><br \/>Cervelia is applying for a loan which she plans to reinvest into purchasing three pigs to increase sales and thus further increase her capital.  Aside from selling meat, Cervelia is also involved in the sale of vegetables and spices to increase the flavor of meats, which is an added benefit for her primary meat shop. <br \/><br \/>The majority of the trust bank members did not have the same opportunity as Cervelia in receiving nine years of formal education; this has not stopped them from being successful in their respective businesses, however. The other members own and operate a variety of different business that include: weaving and bordering huipiles, producing elaborate and detailed ornaments, cosmetic sales, and other things. At the end of the day, the eight women of \u201cOlas de Atitlan\u201d are proof of how far women of Guatemala can go when given the right resources. <br \/><br \/>These women are sure that, with the loan from Kiva, they will be able to accomplish any goal that they set their minds to.

She is 22 years old, married, and in this relationship has a 5-year-old son, who is a student. Her husband works in a factory in the city. \r\n\r\nJessica is a very hard-working young woman who, to help her husband with the household expenses, works in sales. She sells clothing, shoes and Avon and Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes and ladies' accessories). She sells from door to door. She goes out to sell in the mornings since at this time it is cooler and her son is in class and in the afternoon she has to help him do his homework. In addition, she sells from her house where her best known customers come. She leaves her products on credit and collects each week. She has been doing this work for over 5 years, which has allowed her to earn something which she invests in her son. \r\n\r\nThis loan is to purchase clothing, shoes, perfumes, creams, and everything that she sells. She has been in the loan group since the beginning and she likes it because the loans help her with her business. Her dream is to give her little one the best.

Elizabeth of Matina, Davao City finds it true. She and her husband, Virgilio, both sell street food at \u201cTsanggihan sa Katauhan\u201d (translates as people\u2019s market) located along a boulevard in Davao City. It\u2019s a prolific place for their business since it\u2019s a market cum people\u2019s park. They sell softdrinks and self-prepared beverages, French fries, fried banana and sweet potato, and their specialty \u2013 \u201ckwek-kwek\u201d, a popular street food made from boiled egg covered with flour, deeply fried and skewered on a bamboo stick. It is usually dipped in vinegar with fermented chili and pepper. \r\n\r\nFor now, their income suffices for their everyday expenditures because their children are still in high school and elementary levels. But Elizabeth\u2019s forward looking mindset drives her to save early for the college education of her children. She plans to buy more street food ingredients and simultaneously, add fruits and vegetables as another enterprise that her husband can sell separately. She appeals for PhP 29,000 supplementary capital for this purpose. This will surely increase their combined profit. She hopes that their business will steadily improve so as to attain their dream of renovating their house, completing their children\u2019s college education, and acquiring a multicab as family vehicle. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is a devoted member of CCT Credit Cooperative and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

used to buy paint, pipes and brushes, cement, steel, nails, and other hardware items to sell and deliver to his customers. His hardware store is doing well with more stock. Bryan retained his regular customers, and more customers are ordering and buying from him. <br \/><br \/>Bryan was able to pay his loan on time, and the loan extended benefits not to just him, but also the employees in his stores. Bryan employed another person to deliver his goods, as his orders are growing. More importantly, through the revenue of his income, he continuously supports his family and other people under his scholarship.<br \/><br \/>Bryan is on his third loan now, and is availing himself of a PHP 150,000 loan to buy 50 boxes of canned goods, 70 boxes of noodles, 50 boxes of bottled products, 20 boxes of coffee, 20 boxes of bar and powder soaps, and materials needed for the renovation of his store. He wanted to expand the store, accommodate more customers inside, and display his stock.<br \/><br \/>The loan will enable him to continuously expand and stock items that are in demand this rainy season, like noodles and instant soups.<br \/><br \/>Bryan has high hopes to expand more to become a wholesale distributor in his community.

Her husband will purchase the needed things such as a sewing machine, needles, thread and fabric with the help of the loan. Raheela is feeling happy that she will be able to help her husband with the loan amount. She is thankful to Kiva lenders and to BRAC Pakistan.

She is married and has four children who are all currently in school. For the past four years, Edisa has been working hard to manage her retail shop. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Edisa has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. She will use the loan to buy commodities such as sugar and posho (maize flour), which will help Edisa to generate greater profits and improve her business. Edisa hopes that in the future she will be able to have a bigger business. \r\n\r\nEdisa is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Edisa who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":126.98,"image":{"id":1945362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She has been buying and selling dried fish for 10 years now. She buys directly from producers and suppliers near the seashore so as to take advantage of lower prices. In this way, Leonila can earn higher profits which helps her meet her usual expenditures. It\u2019s her way of supplementing her husband\u2019s irregular income as a carpenter. Leonila and her husband have five children, two of whom are still studying in college. It is indeed pocket-draining, which is why the couple works hard to complete their children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nThis rainy season, Leonila knows that there are times when dried fish will be scarce. But there are also favorable days when it will be abundant and cheap. She plans to seize those favorable days to buy assorted dried fish in high volume. She needs PHP 8,000 to keep her business running during the rainy season. The income from her business will help her meet her family's everyday needs and cover her children\u2019s educational expenses.

Patient and hardworking men are the usual trisikad drivers. One of them is Marycel\u2019s husband, Emelecio. He drives one of their trisikads and he rents out the other one to his friend. When their trisikads break down, two families suffer the loss of income. \r\n\r\nAs of now, Marycel hopes to borrow PHP 15,000 to buy spare parts to efficiently maintain her trisikads. She wants to purchase another unit to boost her income and to employ another friend as trisikad driver. Part of the loan will be used as seed money for this new unit. Marycel is doing this endeavor for the future of her child who is still in elementary school. She wants to save as early as possible for her college education.\r\n\r\nMarycel is a dutiful member of CCT Credit Cooperative and meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
