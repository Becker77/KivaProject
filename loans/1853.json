","en":"This young and generous man is called Abdusamad. He is from the Shahrituz region. He is only 23 years old, however he already had quite some success. Abdusamad works as a teacher at one of the schools in his region. Despite his young age, he knows how to treat the students, and strives to meet their needs. He knows the character of each of his students. <br \/><br \/>Unfortunately Abdusamad's salary is very low, but despite this he continues to works. His mission is to give the children a good education. His whole family is dependent only on him, and in order to provide them with everything necessary, Abdusamad also works with crop production.

He is the father of two children, ages 5 and 2, and he is in a common-law marriage.  His partner does the household chores, and cares for their children.  He lives with only his partner and two children.\r\n\r\nAlejandro, along with his father and brothers, cultivate the land, growing corn and beans.  When he was very young, his father taught him how to work and cultivate the land, but he is also engaged as a day laborer where he earns $5.00 per day.  He has to walk a kilometer to get to his farm land.  In addition to these activities, he also has five cows, which he has to put out to pasture and milk in the morning.  \r\n\r\nThanks to the previous loan, he had a very good production from his crops because he bought and applied the necessary fertilizers for plant growth, and this allowed him to obtain a good harvest.  He managed to sell a part of his harvest, and keep the rest to feed his family.  Now, he needs this new loan to purchase fertilizer and pay for labor costs.  Likewise, this loan will allow him to obtain greater production, and higher income for his family\u2019s daily sustenance. \r\n\r\nAlejandro wishes to have a better quality of life for himself and his family, obtain a greater production of basic grains, and live comfortably in a decent place with his children\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":152.5,"image":{"id":1936518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase manure, fertilizer,and pay for labor costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-08-04T22:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-03T22:50:05Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Alejandro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":35.18},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":37.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":39.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":40.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":41.51},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":43.39},{"due_date":"2016-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":44.39},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":46.81},{"due_date":"2016-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.18},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.77},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.88},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.51},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.39},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.39},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.81},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.04,"local_amount":75.04,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":75.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711455109},{"amount":39.6,"local_amount":39.6,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":39.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730975625},{"amount":37.86,"local_amount":37.86,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":37.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752064138}],"funded_date":"2015-08-05T14:05:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Francoletti-Putz","image":null}},{"id":927004,"name":"Mahadeb Shg-B Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The lady standing on the left-hand side in the photo is Daimati.

Este pr\u00e9stamo  cambiaria positivamente mi vida porque me quitar\u00eda un peso de encima de siempre estar pensando de donde voy a conseguir el dinero para pagar la universidad y mantener la casa; me dar\u00eda un gran respiro econ\u00f3mico y mentalmente.\nMi meta es graduarme y poder hacerlo con notas excelentes para poder regalarle  eso a mi familia que me ha apoyado siempre en lo que es este gran desaf\u00edo. Personalmente quiero ir creciendo como persona y tambi\u00e9n como ciudadano para poder ser un hombre estudiado que pueda aportar su conocimiento al pa\u00eds para bien. Despu\u00e9s de terminar mi carrera me gustar\u00eda hacer una maestr\u00eda en esta carrera. Despu\u00e9s que le haga, estudiar econom\u00eda o fisicoculturismo.\n","en":"Pablor Roberto is a young student in the International Business degree program. He is asking for a loan to cover his educational costs. This is his story: My name is Pablo Roberto. I am 22 years old and I live in the 24 de abril sector. I was born and raised in Santo Domingo. I have 4 siblings on my father's side and I am the only child on my mother's side. I am not married and don't have children. My mother is not currently working and I haven't had any contact with my father. \r\n\r\nI wanted to study for a degree in international business at Unapec because I like this area which is international commerce and it is a degree with a lot of future since all the countries are opening their borders to sell their products and also get some products which they don't sell in that country. Currently I am in my 6th term. I have taken many courses and have seen that I really want to study and learn more about this field. Among the courses I have studied, I liked Introduction to Business a lot; it is the base of this entire major. \r\n\r\nI am asking for this loan because I really need it to continue studying since my mother is not working and I haven't had a relationship with my father since I was little. Currently, in my house we are getting a pension for my grandmother from her work because she had a serious illness and now can't work and my mother has to stay home to care for her. This pension is very small, it is our income each month in my house, apart from my salary which is also very small. This is the only income we are getting in my house each month. Currently I work in a dietary supplement store where I am a salesperson. \r\n\r\nIf my loan is not accepted, I will have to stop my schooling until I get a job with more income to see if I am able to pay and also to keep up the monthly household expenses. This loan will positively change my life because it will take off the weight of always thinking of where I am going to get the money to pay for university and support the household. It would give me a great economic and mental relief.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to graduate and be able to do it with excellent grades to be able to give this to my family who has always supported me in this which is a great challenge. Personally, I want to continue growing as a person and also as a citizen to be able to be an educated man who can contribute his knowledge to the country for its good. After finishing my degree, I would like to get a masters in this field. After I do that, to study economy or bodybuilding."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1937555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to cover higher education costs.
