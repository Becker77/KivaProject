He will also purchase a web-enabled mobile phone and a cash box. \r\n\r\nHe thanks the Kiva lenders for helping him and his family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1942737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology"],"use":"To start running his Zoona money transfer business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MW","country":"Malawi","town":"Kasungu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.5 34","type":"point"}},"partner_id":444,"posted_date":"2015-08-05T01:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-04T01:00:07Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kondwani","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MWK","disbursal_amount":516500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2016-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12028},{"due_date":"2017-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":312024}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.19},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.19},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":679.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-22T01:02:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":927109,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is 36 years old.

She lives with her partner, has two children of 15 and 17 years of age, and she is in the business of constructing sheets.  She is a good mother and an entrepreneur.  She is independent, kind, patient, responsible and very hard-working.  She conducts her business in the South zone of the city, characterized by intense economic activity that led to the establishment of the biggest markets and innumerable shopping centers and commercial premises.  The city's climate is warm subtropical with a temperature that varies between 21-35 degrees Celsius during the day.  \n\nMercedes has a medium complexion, grayish-brown eyes, short black hair, and a short, strong stature.  Her native language is Guarani, which she speaks at home, and she speaks Spanish with the general public and for her business.  She shares her life with her partner, who is employed, and her children, who attend school.  They live in a rented room built of brick and cement with a corrugated iron roof and cement floor.  Their home has electricity, drinkable water, and sewage plumbing.  Her business is the construction and wholesaling of sheets.  She is responsible for purchasing cuts of fabric to construct sheets, comforters, bedspreads, and more.  \"I construct sheets and sell them wholesale.

It has potable water, electrical energy, and gas and sewer services. \r\n\r\nHer business is making blankets from vicu\u00f1a wool. Her work requires traveling long distances in the altiplano in search of producers of vicu\u00f1a wool, which she cleans in order to then spin. Once she has sufficient wool, she is ready to weave it on a loom. The business is genuinely artesanal, and every blanket takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks to finish. \"I began my business because of the invitation of a close friend who worked in this before and because I knew the area wool producers,\" she comments. \r\n\r\nThe good thing about her business is that the blankets of this quality have great demand. The problem is the lack of capital to buy vicu\u00f1a wool wholesale. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to create a little business. She wants to make the purchase of vicu\u00f1a wool wholesale in order to produce a greater quantity and to buy another loom. This is her first sequence of loans with the institution in the two years that she has had this business.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Rosa is applying for a loan for the purchase of vicu\u00f1a wool wholesale to make blankets and buy another loom with the earnings. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":437.14,"image":{"id":1938644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy vicu\u00f1a wool wholesale to make blankets and with the earnings to buy another loom","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-08-05T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-04T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-24T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-15T04:00:00Z","amount":116.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T04:00:00Z","amount":98.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T04:00:00Z","amount":109.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T04:00:00Z","amount":112.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T04:00:00Z","amount":113.7},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T04:00:00Z","amount":122.13},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T04:00:00Z","amount":124.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T04:00:00Z","amount":129.61},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T04:00:00Z","amount":136.32},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T04:00:00Z","amount":140.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T04:00:00Z","amount":145.99},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T04:00:00Z","amount":150.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.7},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.13},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.59},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.32},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":215.55,"local_amount":215.55,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":215.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711469069},{"amount":109.5,"local_amount":109.5,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":109.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296902},{"amount":112.09,"local_amount":112.09,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":112.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077040}],"funded_date":"2015-08-11T04:56:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":927074,"name":"Ma.

This means that Stevie will provide mobile money and bill payment services for people in his community, thus earning profits from the transactions. He is very happy and excited to be able to start running his own business and needs a loan from Kiva to make this happen. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Stevie will be able to purchase the equipment he needs to start running his own business. He will purchase a trading trolley from which he will conduct his business. He will place the trolley at one of the busy farmers' shops in Mchinji.

She has a life ambition to pay the education of her son and to improve the conditions of her home. \r\n\r\nShe began the business at the start of 2014, because of economic need and for the pleasure of self-employment. The main advantage of having a business located in her home is the ease of taking care of her son when he needs it. Yury has always looked for progress with her business, and she does not conform to only making enough to survive. She counts on friends like Interactuar that not only lend her money, but they also advise and accompany her so that she can grow. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Yury wants to ask for a loan to buy a supply of basic family needs products. With the loan, she hopes to improve her sales, increase her customers, and increase her utility. She promises to pay back the loan because it is a way of showing gratitude towards the confidence that they can have in her by loaning her a small amount of money. \r\n "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":57.4,"image":{"id":1942196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a supply of basic family needs products.

She wanted to start  her own business but could not obtain working capital. She applied for a loan but was declined as she did not own any property and the banks required her to have some collateral. Wanna has since been helping her parents at the farm. She explains that it has not been easy to meet her basic needs and those of her son.  Wanna is hopeful that with this loan, she will be able to start her own business as a Zoona mobile money transfer agent in her community.\r\n\r\nWanna has successfully completed training with Zoona to start  her own business.

This group is made up of six members and is led by Gladys. The members of this group are in charge of various types of businesses. Among them are firewood, drinks, rubber bowls, silver products, soaps, and smoked-fish businesses.\r\n\r\nThe loan that they will take out will benefit small micro-enterprises of which Gladys is a member. She mentions that she joined ID Ghana by invitation from a friend, who is a client of the institution. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Gladys has a business selling firewood. She started this business 30 years ago and has been doing it until now. The loan that she will take out is to increase capital. She will buy more firewood from the wholesalers in the city of Accra and she will sell it to her customers.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I was born in 1981 in a village near Yogyakarta, a city which is rich in art and culture. In Java, arts and crafts are typically used in custom events and batik art is closely associated with traditional ceremonies. My parents taught me about working hard to follow my dreams and to always think positive, to be wise and help others. The spirit of an entrepreneur grew within me, and I decided to resign from the company where I worked. The wood batik artisans in my village were unemployed, as the company where they worked was closed. Most of them are women, and I began organizing them. Now, they can work at home and have more time for their families. We work on wood with manual tools for the batik process which is time-consuming. We craft wood batik ornaments, accessories and decor with the best quality we can, and incorporate our traditional batik culture into our designs. I hope people around the world will know better about us and our Javanese batik culture\"\r\n\r\n\"Right now I need some capital to increase my inventory. I hand paint batik on wood using wax and a coloring process that requires time and patience. Your support will help to sustain our craft.\"\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Gunadi's wood batik centerpieces and ornaments on the NOVICA site:\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/8787\">http:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/8787"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1.44,"image":{"id":1946736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to invest in a purchase of raw materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Java","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2015-08-05T14:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-04T14:40:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gunadi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":350,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1.44,"local_amount":1.44,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731141986}],"funded_date":"2015-08-05T14:59:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":927201,"name":"Zamukamunyarwanda Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felecite is a group leader; aged 56 years.She is married with 6 children aged between 22 and 30 years.

Her husband is a daily labourer, and their income can hardly meet their needs, as their family expenses are high.<br \/> <br \/>Chonghoineng raises her pigs in the backyard of their home compound. She normally raises one or two pigs at a time. She now aspires to raise more pigs in the hope to make more profit. With the Kiva loan, she will buy five piglets to raise at her pig sty. <br \/><br \/>Her favorite part of raising pigs is to feed the hungry pigs on time so that they grow healthy and big. \u201cThe uncertainty about this business is that when the pig suddenly dies, your investment is lost.\u201d<br \/><br \/>She will sell the pigs for profit after one year. The profit will help her family to pay for the children\u2019s education cost and meet their required basic necessities. She also aspires to buy a solar home lighting system in the near future if her present business becomes successful. She is very happy to get the loan.<br \/><br \/>The rest of the group members will use the loan to help their businesses. They are very excited to get the loan. They all strive for financial freedom."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1943357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

She will use the proceeds of her loan to pay for whitening soaps, cleanser, toner, moisturizer, sunblock, and some bags and wallets as well. Filipinos are  crazy about having a fair and smooth skin. Most Filipina girls have \"morena\" skin tone, so they want to regularly use whitening products to achieve a fair and clearer complexion. She is thanking God and you in advance for granting her request, for it will surely help grow her business and assist her husband in making a living.<br \/><br \/>Ma.

He would like to invest in new equipment, including wood pedals, a loom comb and spinning wheels and purchase raw materials in bulk, such as wool, natural dyes and firewood. He also plans to increase the physical space of his workshop and bring on additional weavers.\r\n\r\nGregorio has been selling through NOVICA since 2004. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I am the youngest son in a family of weavers from Teotitlan del Valle, and I learned from my parents and brothers how to weave. I would watch them prepare the yarn, how they dyed them with natural colors, and thread them on the loom. I feel very proud to preserve this art, which my parents learned from my grandparents. I began weaving my own Zapotec wool rugs when I finished middle school and since then I've been in different exhibitions and art fairs in Oaxaca and throughout the country. The recognition and congratulations I have received from clients and friends has been amazing! What I enjoy most about weaving is the creative aspect: from designing a rug to weaving it. I wove my first rug when I was 13 years old and I remember my father being so pleased with it that he didn't hesitate taking it with him to sell. Ever since, I've been making rugs and now my sons have also learned our craft. In 1966 I started my own workshop and my wool products have traveled beyond Mexico's frontiers. I love what I do! The culture and natural environment of Oaxaca inspire me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that with your support I can achieve everything I want, and do so with enthusiasm and faith.

Sara works in agriculture, raising poultry. Sara has been involved in this business for 12 years. She is a very hardworking woman, as she works from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily to care for her poultry business. However, the thing that she lacks is access to clean water.<br \/><br \/>She says, \"we drink well water, we wash our clothes with contaminated river water, and we are sick all the time because we drink dirty water...\".

She will also use part of the loan to buy beauty products such as whitening soap, cleanser, toner, moisturizer and sunblock to sell at retail prices. \r\n\r\nAlthough there are times that it's difficult to collect payment from those who buy on credit, she is still encouraged that her sales are good and have increased this year.

She studied classics in the faculty of arts of one of Mexico's most prestigious universities. Four years ago, she and a group of friends started working on books for the joy of it. They decided that it would be a good idea to start offering editorial services, and their business was born.\r\nOn top of being an entrepreneur with her editing business, Jocelyn also works for a civil society organization of authors in search of financing. She wants to be a leader in editing services, to have a large range of clients, and to work on a range of scientific, artistic, and cultural works. Her main challenge is a lack of capital for operating costs. Her clients take a long time to do their projects and, thus, to pay.
