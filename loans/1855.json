She is 43 years old and lives in Paranaque City, Philippines. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she manages her sari-sari store (variety store) business. She started this trade ten years ago. Through this long venture in entrepreneurship, she was given a chance to join CCT. Being a member of this group of ministries, she was highly motivated to improve her business. She works persistently to provide for the daily needs of her household. \r\n\r\nA sari-sari store is often seen in the Philippines, especially along the sidewalks and streets. It is most like a convenience store, but smaller and generally offering limited products that are commonly needed such as toiletries, food, beverages, and other commodities. Unlike grocery stores, sari-sari stores offer products at low cost, which is really an advantage for customers. At some point, customers can also have credit, but this sometimes becomes a difficulty for Juliet, especially when debts are not paid. \r\n\r\nTo improve her sales, Juliet asks for help from you. She would like to borrow a loan of PHP 15,000 to purchase additional products and merchandise items for her store. With this, she expects to grow her sales and improve her family\u2019s living conditions. Today, you can be a big part of her life. \r\n\r\nShe meets every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business, and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1944481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional products and merchandise items for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Para\u00f1aque City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-08-06T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-05T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":163.36,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":7469.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434325},{"amount":93.32,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4268.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955243},{"amount":93.32,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4268.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045087}],"funded_date":"2015-08-06T01:02:30Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":924392,"name":"Maria Pastora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pastora es una se\u00f1ora trabajadora, ella vive con su esposo y con sus 4 hijos menores de edad que se encuentran estudiando, ella se dedica a criar chanchos y tambi\u00e9n trabaja a medio tiempo arreglando una casa, su esposo se dedica a trabajar al jornal de trabajo en el campo, el cr\u00e9dito lo va a invertir en la compra de chanchos, Pastora aspira seguir trabajando para mejorar sus ingreso y cubrir los gastos de estudio de sus hijos.","en":"Pastora is a hardworking lady.

St. George School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>St. George School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

This is Alfred. He is the director of the Little Angels Ntungamo School, a mixed school in the Rural area of Ntungamo with 500 students. Little Angels School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a 750-liter UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term and the cost of firewood will be reduced.

African Outreach School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a 1,000-liter UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. Sarah will use her loan to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nAfrican Outreach School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Sarah ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases.

She is a good mother, enterprising, dynamic, optimistic, generous, responsible, and very hardworking.  \r\n\r\nHer business is located in Sacaba, located 13 kilometers east, which is a culinary capital famous for its cuisine based in rabbit and guinea pig meat and other dishes.  It is also famous for its numerous pleasant-tasting \"chicher\u00edas\" produced from \"chicha de ma\u00edz\" (a purple corn drink fermented from the same), slyly citing the town name from:  \"Sacaba, where the chicha never ends\".  The climate is warm and moderately dry.\r\n\r\nTomasa is tan-skinned, brown-eyed, short-staured, and a slim physical build.  She has long black hair that she wears braided.  Her manner of dressing is traditional (hat, shawl, and pleated skirt).  She uses her native language, Quechua, in this locale and Spanish in mainstream culture and business.  She shares her life with her husband -- who works in agriculture -- and her daughter who is not yet school-aged.  They live in their own house, constructed from adobe and wood with a corrugated metal roof and an earthen floor.  It has pump-extracted well water, electric energy, and doesn't have a sewage system.\r\n\r\nHer business is in the production and sale of walnut sweets.  Recently, the national government awarded financing to connect potable water in this locale.  \"We use well water, it is dirty and stains clothing.  We want to connect potable water to better our lives and also my business,\" she comments.  The advantage of her business is that there is demand for it.  The disadvantage is the lack of capital for the installation of potable water in her kitchen, bathroom, and laundry.  Her dream is to have potable water in her home.  She wants to see the installation of potable water in her kitchen, bathroom, and laundry to better her health and hygienic conditions.  This is the first in a series of loans with the institution in four years she's been dedicated to this activity.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Tomasa is requesting a loan for the installation of potable water in her kitchen, bathroom, and laundry, to better her health and hygienic conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1942939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"with the installation of potable water in her kitchen, bathroom, and laundry to better her health and hygienic conditions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-08-06T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-05T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-08T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":71.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T04:00:00Z","amount":78.71},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T04:00:00Z","amount":76.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T04:00:00Z","amount":78.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T04:00:00Z","amount":80.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T04:00:00Z","amount":81.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T04:00:00Z","amount":83.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T04:00:00Z","amount":86.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T04:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T04:00:00Z","amount":89.76},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T04:00:00Z","amount":91.34},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T04:00:00Z","amount":93.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.39},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.71},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.66},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.24},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.76},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.34},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.48,"local_amount":71.48,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":71.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711469089},{"amount":928.52,"local_amount":928.52,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":928.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296942}],"funded_date":"2015-08-13T19:21:20Z","paid_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Konieczny","image":null}},{"id":927619,"name":"Auwalu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Auwalu is a Babban Gona maize farmer from Dokantoro Village.

in the small region of Rudaki. She is 25 years old. She is a wonderful wife and mother of one child. \r\n\r\nMohira has been sewing for about five years. This is an ideal job for her, because most of the time she has to stay at home because of certain circumstances. Being masterful at her profession as a tailor, Mohira will always be able to accept additional jobs, fulfilling her clients' orders.

In urban areas, many individuals use it as personal service vehicle to pass through the congested traffic more easily. In remote areas, on the other hand, it is being used to transport passengers. Two to three passengers (back riders) can occupy the backseat of the motorcycle, and it can occupy more if it has an extension seat that is usually made of wood. It\u2019s more efficient than four-wheeled vehicle because it can make its way through narrow and grassy roads. \r\n\r\nCharlie, 34, from Tigbauan, Iloilo drives his motorcycle for passengers to earn a living. He also runs a variety store and a hog raising venture. In times that he\u2019s out and driving, his wife, Reymilyn, watches over their store and their small piggery while taking care of their two young children. But there are times that his motorcycle can\u2019t function well, so he has to adjust his budget in order to sustain their everyday needs. Furthermore, he\u2019s still paying the monthly installment of his motorcycle and it cuts a large chunk of money from his income. He wishes to fully pay it this month so he can save some money to prepare for his children\u2019s education. A loan worth PhP 14,000 would be enough for this purpose. He can still use part of the loan to buy motor parts, additional supplies for his variety store and feed for his hogs. \r\n\r\nIn due time, he plans to buy another unit of motorcycle which he can rent out to his friend. He wishes to acquire a house and lot for his family someday. He shares his aspirations to his co-fellowship* members at CCT Credit Cooperative who regularly meet once a week to strengthen each other through the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The loan funds were used to buy additional stocks of items such as bottled drinks, grocery items, and school supplies. \r\n\r\nLyra aims to have a one-stop shop that carries all items needed by consumers. She is aware that competitors on this line of business are rampant, so she is contemplating ways to attract buyers to her shop. One of her goals is to turning her sari-sari store into a grocery store. \r\n\r\nSince the store is her bread and butter, Lyra exerts a great deal of effort and hard work for the business, since it has allowed her to sustain her family\u2019s needs and support her children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nAdded capital will help her business flourish, which is why Lyra decided to apply for another PhP 26,000 loan this year. She will use her loan funds to buy additional stocks such as laundry products, drinks, toiletries, canned goods, and school supplies to offer for sale. \r\n\r\nLyra is consistent in attending the weekly fellowship group for CCT partners, consisting of 15 to 30 members. Here she gains spiritual strength from other members' life-changing testimonies, shares her own experience of God\u2019s love, pays micro-finance loans, and hears God\u2019s Word each week."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":335.44,"image":{"id":1947713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase grocery items like rice, canned goods, condiments, and beverages to offer for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-08-06T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-05T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lyra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":215.64,"local_amount":9749.97,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":9860.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955255},{"amount":119.8,"local_amount":5416.65,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5478.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045099}],"funded_date":"2015-09-05T19:36:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":927864,"name":"Said","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Said, age 32, saw his small house in Rafah City destroyed completely during the latest conflict in Gaza.
