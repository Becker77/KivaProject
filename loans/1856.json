is 28 and her husband is a young and energetic person living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. He is the father of a baby boy and they live near his clothing shop. This clothing shop is the only source of income for his family. For this reason, he devotes all his all efforts and time to the garment shop. \r\nHis shop is situated under the clothing market and there is a lot of competitors in the market. Due to this competition, it is very difficult to convince customers to pay a high price. This competition becomes the cause of low sales and more efforts as well. He has to maintain the latest designs, rates and delightful colors of clothing for his shop so that he can maintain the rate of sales.\r\n\r\nNow the major problem is that the summer season is going on and he does not have sufficient cash on hand to buy clothing related to the current season. \r\nTherefore, Annam has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so that her husband can be empowered to buy summer season's clothing.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her husband will purchase clothing according to his desire at the right time so he can cope with the market competition and could grow his income as well.

To help augment their income, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan to buy more grocery items to sell in her store such as instant noodles, canned good, bread, beverages, etc. Having mostly essential food items will assure her of better sales. She will use part of the loan to buy some tools needed to regularly maintain her jeepney and thus ensure safe and efficient service. Your help will be greatly appreciated as it supports her livelihood.\r\n\r\nEvelyn dreams to have a big grocery store someday. She prays to always have a happy and healthy family.

Since 1995 she has practiced animal husbandry in order to earn an income for her family. Thanks to her tireless work Kanchaiym today owns six cows and 25 sheep.

His primary source of income has been milk, crops and some small personal business he engages in to supplement his meager income. <br \/><br \/>Charles passionately loves dairy farming, but one challenge he has been facing is the lack of funds to buy a quality breed of cow. He is kindly seeking a loan to buy a superior breed of cow. From the loan, he will get quality milk, which fetches high prices in the local market. He will also get skin and manure, which he will sell to his neighbors and to the local market. Feeding the cow will never be a challenge for Charles because he has planted forage on his farm and will be supplementing this by cutting plants at the river bank for fodder. This will assure him of increased milk production. This loan is going to impact the life of Charles positively. Charles is already thinking ahead, and with the loan, he plans to increase his milk production and sell to the big milk processing firms. Other than milk from the cow, he will benefit from the manure, which will improve his farm fertility and result in high productivity.

in Cambodia. Since 1995, vegetable farming has been the main source of her family\u2019s income. Her husband, age 41, is a farmer as well. Two of her four children work in construction and four are in school.

She is a divorcee and now lives with her children and her elderly father in a small brick house that is not well ventilated, nor warms up well in winter. She works long hours to ensure there is enough food for her children and father. All her children still go to school and the only means of income comes entirely from her with very little pension from her father.She used to wake up very early between 3am and 4am during the week, to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water and warming the house for her children before they go to school because she could not afford any other means. However with little money she makes while working plus her father's pension money;which is not much, she is now able to afford to buy gas and paraffin both which are very expensive.She finds herself having to pay about R300 to R400 a month to have sufficient gas;money she hardly makes. Not only is gas expensive for Marapelang and many like her, but it is also highly flammable and when inhaled can lead to lung diseases even death. Marapelang has requested a loan from Kiva lenders, in order to be able to purchase clean cook stoves which provide her and 12 other people from her village, who are living in the same circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families, and that does not require a lot of wood, which is hard to find in Lesotho, nor expensive paraffin and gas. This stove can be started with the use of very little, readily available biomass like dry twigs and dry cow dung that do not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the homes. This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones and a mini LED lamp. A life improving package for these people. This stove saves them time to be with their family, saves energy, eliminates the element of toxic inhalation, house burning and has given them the freedom to have a better lit home to see better in the evening while cooking and enables children to do their homework.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Masebatli is a 42 year old mother of 4 children aged between 15 and 9 years. She lives in a brick hut that is not well ventilated, nor warms up well in winter. She and her husband work long hours to ensure there is enough food for their children, whom all go to school during the week and can only help in the field and looking after animals on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. She used to wake up very early between 3am and 4am during the week, to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water and warming the house for all the children before they go to school because she could not afford any other means. However with selling her crops and livestock, she was then able to buy gas and replaced her means of cooking although this became very expensive. She found herself having to pay about R300 to R400 a month to have sufficient gas;money she hardly makes. Not only is gas expensive for Masebatli and many like her, but it is highly flammable and when inhaled can lead to lung diseases even death. Masebatli has requested a loan from Kiva lenders, in order to be able to purchase clean cook stoves which provide Masebatli and 9 other people from her village, who are living in the similar circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families, and that does not require a lot of wood, which is hard to find in Lesotho, nor expensive paraffin and gas. This stove can be started with the use of very little, readily available biomass like dry twigs and dry cow dung that do not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the homes. This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones and a mini LED lamp. A life improving package for these people. This stove saves them time to be with their family, saves energy, eliminates the element of toxic inhalation, house burning and has given them the freedom to have a better lit home to see better in the evening while cooking and enables children to do their homework.

paper, board, plastic, bottles, and others. She will then sell these items to a junk shop. For some, it\u2019s a filthy job but for Mary, she will do everything to help provide for the needs of her family. She is married to Romeo, a fisherman, and they have four children, two of whom are forced to stop schooling due to financial insufficiency. They are staying in Tigbauan, Iloilo. \r\n\r\nMary also sells dried fish occasionally. She has little capital for this, so she does the buying and selling when there\u2019s a good opportunity. This rainy season is not a good opportunity for her dried fish vending as well as her husband\u2019s fishing endeavor. Hence Mary wants to concentrate on her scrap business this season. She appeals for PhP 12,000 additional capital for buying scrap. Part of it will be used to buy replacement for her husband\u2019s damaged fishing nets. Hopefully, this will augment her family\u2019s daily needs this rainy season. \r\n\r\nShe dreams that someday her family will taste a little comfort in life.

Thanks to Babban Gona\u2019s support, Dahiru now has the opportunity to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1948157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase improved farm inputs that will increase his yields.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-08-07T14:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-06T14:40:07Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dahiru","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":115024.91,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":115024.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-21T17:32:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":928169,"name":"Seseme Girls School","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Uganda!

widow, and the mother of four children. She has secondary education and is on a pension. Her children are working and they help her financially. <br \/><br \/>In search of an additional income for her family, Kasiet works with livestock breeding, after having started this in 1995. Thanks to Kasiet's persistent work, her farm currently has four cows and ten sheep. <br \/><br \/>With an aim to further develop her business, Kasiet turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) to purchase four cows and some sheep to increase her income.

She is a mother of one little child. To make a living, she manages and operates a farming business on a small rice farmland and earns, on average, USD 10 a day. So far, she has been in this career for ten years. She resides a little bit far from the water source so it is hard and time consuming for her to get water. Due to this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan to dig a pond for household use.

It is made from boiled egg covered with flour, deeply fried and skewered on a bamboo stick. It is usually dipped in vinegar with fermented chili and pepper or vinegar with cucumber. And because it\u2019s getting popular, the competition gets stiffer and the supply of raw ingredients diminishes. \n\nAnacita from Davao City has been in this business for nine years now. She has a lot of competitors these days, and she finds it difficult to purchase eggs, which are the main ingredient in her food stall business. There are times when she sees the opportunity for volume supply of eggs, but her capital is not enough. She yearns to obtain additional capital of 29,000 Philippine pesos that she can use to buy more eggs if the chances arise. It\u2019s her way of staying competitive in this kind of business. \n\nAnacita complements her husband\u2019s irregular income as a carpenter in order to meet their daily needs as well as the educational expenses of their four children. She plans to put up an eatery in the near future because it will surely give her higher profit. All her efforts will pay off if she sees all her children receive a college diploma and gain a successful career. She meets with her co-fellowship members* at the Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative (CCT) every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. \n\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

She is a very sympathetic, hard-working, responsible, kind-hearted, and modest woman. She has a secondary vocational education and works as a secretary, receiving a salary of 4,860 som (KGS). She has also been rearing animals and growing crops for ten years. She has three cows, 18 sheep, and a horse. Gulzhamal grows corn and potatoes on a 0.1 hectare plot of land for sale and for use on her own farm. Gulzhamal's husband and children help her with everything around the farm.\r\n\r\nGulzhamal has long dreamed of opening her own poultry farm. She already has about ten ordinary domestic hens. Reaching towards her dream, in May 2015 Gulzhamal undertook a business planning training course as part of a \"Start Your Own Business\" competition that was conducted in the southern regions of Kyrgyzstan. She became one of the competition's 35 finalists. This accumulated knowledge has enabled Gulzhamal to compile a business plan. She has evaluated everything and decided to take a \"start-up business\" loan from Bai Tushum Bank of 50,000 som (KGS). Gulzhamal plans to acquire 88 egg-laying hens costing 500 som (KGS) each. She will direct the remaining funds towards building a special warm barn for keeping the hens, and she will buy netting, metal sheets, stands, and poles for construction. This will enable her to raise the chickens and gather eggs even in winter.\r\n\r\nGulzhamal plans to receive one egg per chicken each day. The main consumers of the eggs will be local residents, cafes, shops and schools. The corn that she has grown will serve as feed for the chickens, and also using a churn Gulzhamal will get corn oil cake. According to Gulzhamal's calculations, the chickens' daily requirement for feed is 100 grams. She already has an agreement with a local veterinarian for ongoing monitoring of her livestock and chickens. Gulzhamal's forecast gross profit will grow to 17,800 som (KGS). The development of a new type of business will enable Gulzhamal to improve her family's well-being. If her plans are realized, she plans to increase production each year."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":132,"image":{"id":1946671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to start a new business by buying 88 hens and constructing a special poultry barn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Aksy district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-08-07T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-06T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.78,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulzhamal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3799},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3862},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3926},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3992},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4058},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4126},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4195},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4265},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4336},{"due_date":"2016-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4408},{"due_date":"2016-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4481},{"due_date":"2016-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4552}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.78},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.87},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.22},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.37},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.54},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.94},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":129.22,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-19T12:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":8054.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.78,"payment_id":730934342}],"funded_date":"2015-08-11T15:25:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":925536,"name":"Siyavus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Siyavus is from Agdash.

He chose this activity because many people in the place where he lives wear typical clothing. This type of business is very profitable for him.\r\n\r\nAlthough he is only a street vendor with no fixed stand from which to sell, this has not prevented Carlos from taking the initiative to prosper.

Trusted Care School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nTrusted Care School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.
