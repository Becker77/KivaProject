Flying high as the eagle does is a focal point to instill a vigor in the children to seek high results in everything they do and develop characteristics just like the strong eagle\u2019s instincts.\r\n\r\nThe aim of Eagle\u2019s Nest is to provide a quality diverse education and vocational training to their children so that they advance to their highest level of achievement in life. \r\n\r\nEagle\u2019s requests a loan to purchase ICT educational resources to assist in their contribution to providing the diverse quality education that they strive for to the children at the school using modern education technology in the form of the ZEduPad. The ZEduPad is a revolutionary e-learning educational tablet designed for children that has preloaded content mapped to the Zambian Primary School curriculum. This educational tablet is now being used in schools throughout Zambia and many parts of Africa.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1948327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Mobile Technology"],"use":"To purchase ZEduPads for the children in her school.

Tigbauan, Iloilo has a bordering sea on one side that provides a lot of benefits to the people in the community. But in November 2013 the area was devastated by Typhoon Haiyan, a super typhoon that\u2019s famous for its ruthless wrath. Rubylyn, her fisherman husband Bobbie, and their two children were lucky to survive the harsh calamity with the grace of God. \r\n\r\nRubylyn owns a fishing boat and several fishing nets. There was a time after the typhoon that these became useless due to severe damage in the sea. It was after several weeks when her husband was able to go fishing again and she had another chance to sell fish in the market. Since then their livelihood continues to stabilize but their fishing boat deteriorates as time passes by. She hopes to repair it as soon as possible. This is why she humbly requests a PHP 10,000 loan for this purpose. Aside from this, she plans to buy fish from other fishermen in order to enhance her fish selling business. Her experience during Haiyan further strengthens her resolve to boost her income and save more. She plans to acquire another fishing boat in the near future. She would like to ensure that her children will finish their schooling and gain a stable career.

She's been running her store for 15 years already. Managing a business that long, she has experienced different circumstances that have really tested her faith. There were times when her capital was almost drained due to huge collectibles. Some of her neighbors pay weeks or months later for the goods they get from her store. But Daisy remained strong, because this is her way of assisting her husband, Wilfredo, a welder, in providing for their children\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nHer sari-sari store is comparable to a convenience store, but it\u2019s smaller and has limited products commonly used by an individual everyday. It\u2019s quite advantageous for the people in the community to have an accessible variety store to buy one candy, an egg, and so on. This is the reason why sari-sari stores proliferate in the communities of the Philippines. This is also the reason why the competition becomes stiffer and stiffer. Store owners like Daisy continuously strive to make their business competitive. On her part, Daisy chose to add fruits and vegetables to her inventory in the hope that it can entice more customers. Moreover, she plans to expand the selection in her store. She appeals for your help through a loan worth PHP 40,000, which she can use to buy sacks of rice, grocery items, soft drinks and other beverages.

She is requesting PHP 20,000 of additional capital mainly to buy additional merchandise for her store and more items for her direct-selling business. She will also use part of the loan to repair the broken bridge so that her customers can buy from her store again. She has to sustain not only her family's everyday needs but also her child\u2019s college expenses. In a year or two, she will be relieved of huge educational expenses and her dream to enjoy a little comfort in life will come true.\r\n\r\nJulieta is committed to CCT Credit Cooperative\u2019s vision to alleviate poverty and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The loan will also buy grocery stocks such as soft drinks, canned goods, chips, biscuits, noodles, toiletries, laundry soap, diapers, candles, cooking oil, coffee, sugar, powdered milk, juice and chocolate drinks to sell in her store. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Violita wants to increase her stocks to have better earnings. Then, she will be able to have enough money to send all her children to school so they can complete a degree."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":136.4,"image":{"id":1948595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy feed for her pigs and grocery items to sell in her sari-sari (variety) store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pilar, Bohol","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":125,"posted_date":"2015-08-08T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-07T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Violita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.96,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:48:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4162.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730965596},{"amount":45.44,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2081.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752054473}],"funded_date":"2015-08-23T01:25:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":928419,"name":"Rufa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Please meet Rufa, 48 years old, from Bacolod City, Negros Occidental.

Teresa also works in agriculture, and it is from there that she obtains the basic grains to sell.\r\n\r\nTeresa needs the loan in order to buy bread, condiments, and cooking products such as oil, sauces, etc., all for the store.

You can find here variety of items that can be bought at a cheap price since they sell the items by volume, kilo or by the piece. Sari-sari stores are rampant in the Philippines since Filipinos can take care of their family while doing the business because most sari-sari store are just located in the comfort of their own home where they just put up grills or screens as a protection against theft. In front, you\u2019ll see products hanging such as biscuits, candies, and junk foods to attract customers. \r\n\r\nOne entrepreneur who is engaged in this type of business is Jeanie. She is a 37-year-old, who has been a partner of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) since 2010 and is a dedicated member as well.  She has been managing her own sari-sari store business for one year already and enjoys doing it. Jeanie believes that CCT helps aspiring entrepreneurs with their businesses by granting loan requests. Since Jeanie wants to have additional capital for her business, she decided to apply for a PHP 15,000 loan to add items to the business such as bottled drinks, sacks of rice, school supplies and grocery items. \r\n\r\nJeanie regularly meets with her co-fellowship members to share her life\u2019s testimony, experience in the business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and listen to the Word of God.

It\u2019s where you\u2019ll become a reseller of a company and they will provide you with their own brochure to show to your customers. Their products include ready-to-wear clothes for men & women, footwear for all ages, make up, appliances and items for personal use. You\u2019ll become a qualified reseller once you sign up and pay a membership fee. Most mothers who are busy with their families are engaged on this type of business since most of their customers are just their neighbors and friends. Basically their sales pitch or how they will sell the product is one of the gifts that they should possess to flourish on this kind of industry.\r\n\r\nIn every business, you should be patient and persevere to grow. Thelma is one of the partners of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) who has been in the Direct Selling business for years now. This is a business that doesn\u2019t need to have a high capital to start. You just need to have passion and dedication to be successful. You can join or sign up with as many companies as you want since every company sells varieties or unique products so that customers will have different choices. That\u2019s why Thelma is very grateful since CCT helped her by granting the loan that she applied previously. This year, Thelma wants to apply for another loan of 50,000 PHP to have additional products on display, since availability of the products is one thing that should be considered in this type of business. Thelma is anticipating that her request will be granted since this will be a big help for the business.\r\n\r\nThelma believes that if you want success to come in, you need God to be your greatest foundation. She is consistent in attending weekly fellowship group meetings for CCT partners that consists of 15 to 30 members where she gains spiritual strength from members' life changing testimony, share her own experience of God\u2019s love, pay Micro Finance loans and hear God\u2019s word that is conveyed to them every week."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":641.69,"image":{"id":1948359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to have additional products on display for her Direct Selling business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-08-08T11:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-07T11:50:03Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thelma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":458.37,"local_amount":20833.3,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":20988.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955267},{"amount":183.32,"local_amount":8333.32,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":8395.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045111}],"funded_date":"2015-09-07T10:53:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Leanne Kelly","image":null}},{"id":928461,"name":"Braulio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Braulio is an enthusiasic farmer.

He is single but has two children who are eight months and two years old and live with their mother. Oscar lives in the rural community of San Tadeo, located in the northwestern part of the Pichincha Province. The people there are very hard working and united.\r\n\r\nOscar comes from a family with few financial resources, which caused him to leave in search of work. Currently he lives and works at a poultry farm in this sector. He wants to start raising his own broiler chickens. He learned this business through his own initiative and has the necessary experience. His chicken coops are ready, and he will dedicate an average of four hours a day to this work. Since he must keep them clean and make sure that they have everything they need to stay in good condition, they are animals that require a lot of care.\r\n\r\nOscar has many dreams that he wants to achieve. One of them is to have his own business and to work at it as his sole occupation so that he can provide for his children. This loan will help Oscar improve his quality of life and give his children a better future. This is what he fights for every day. He is thankful to KIVA for the support that they are providing to people like him, who haven't been able to fulfill their dreams because of lack of opportunity and financial resources.

With the loan she will be able to buy food in bulk which keeps going up in price.  \r\n\r\n   In addition to this work, Nayeli has been selling plastic containers for the past three years.

She will use the rest of the loan to make repairs to her food stall.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's greatest hope for the future is that her children go on to college and have the opportunities to get ahead that she herself never had.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1944811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to repair her food stall and buy the supplies she needs to carry on her food sales business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"La Uni\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-08-08T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-07T18:10:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":26.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":27.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":29.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":29.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":31.31},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":32.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":31.61},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2016-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":35.82},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":36.23},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2016-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":40.35},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":39.6},{"due_date":"2016-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":41.71},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":44.76},{"due_date":"2016-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2017-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":48.03},{"due_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":49.74},{"due_date":"2017-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":52.53},{"due_date":"2017-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":53.39},{"due_date":"2017-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":55.51},{"due_date":"2017-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":57.28},{"due_date":"2017-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":73.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.39},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.82},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.23},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.35},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.6},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.71},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.76},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.03},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.74},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.53},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.39},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.51},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.28},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":928539,"name":"Roeurm's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roeurm is 44 years old and a married mother of four dependent children, one of whom is under school-age and needs her support.

Her location is strategic for her business and she can cater to both customers who prefer hard copy or soft copy of photos.

There are times when customers line up to wait for their finished orders, and Nenita sees the urgency to procure one more photo printer to meet their needs. She humbly requests for a PHP 15,000 loan for this purpose. Her goal is to put up another branch two to three years from now, and subsequently establish additional business, perhaps a lotto outlet.\r\n\r\nNenita draws inspiration from her co-fellowship* members who meet every week to share stories about their lives and businesses and to draw strength the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Unfortunately her sewing machine is currently broken and in need of repair. Farishta does't have enough money, so she is asking for a loan.
