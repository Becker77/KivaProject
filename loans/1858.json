Edna lives with her handsome husband in Kapsowar, a small rural town in Kenya. The Kapsowar area is also referred to as the mango region of Kenya because half the mangoes consumed are from that region. She has been farming for the past five years and has never looked back. To earn a decent and honest living, she sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. Edna is satisfied with the returns she gets through farming. However, she wants to diversify and start horticultural farming. The main challenge she faces is accessing funds. She is kindly requesting a loan to buy seeds and start horticulture farming. To access funds, Edna joined Juhudi Kilimo, an institution that supports smallholder farmers with both financial and technical solutions. When asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo, she answered, \u201cThey assist small-scale farmers.\u201d Through horticulture, she will be able to improve her living standards and secure the future of her family.

Wanting to give them a brighter future, she\u2019s doing her best to enhance her variety store and internet caf\u00e9 business. She dreams that her children will finish school because she knows that it\u2019s the first step in their success.<br \/><br \/>Mary Ann resides in Fatima, General Santos City with her husband, Mario, and their two children. She is operating a variety store that sells various commodities like canned goods, snack items, candies, toiletries, mineral water and other beverages. She tries to make her store competitive by organizing her stocks in such a way that customers can easily locate their needed products. It\u2019s more pleasant to the eyes and naturally it can entice more buyers. She also started a small internet caf\u00e9 adjacent to it, hoping that internet users could be her captured store buyers. She\u2019s doing this endeavor because her husband\u2019s income as a self-employed worker doesn\u2019t suffice for their children\u2019s educational expenses. One of them is studying in college and the other one is in high school. <br \/><br \/>Now that she aspires to further improve her business, she humbly asks for a PHP 20,000 loan, which she will use to buy assorted grocery items to sell. In the long run, she hopes to convert it into a grocery store with complete supplies. You\u2019ll be a great blessing in advance. Thanks for your heartfelt generosity and goodness. <br \/><br \/>Mary Ann meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1949561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy assorted grocery items to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"General Santos City, South Cotabato","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-08-09T08:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-08T08:40:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":180,"local_amount":7999.98,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":8230.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434353},{"amount":150,"local_amount":6666.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:03Z","rounded_local_amount":6858.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955274},{"amount":120,"local_amount":5333.37,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5487.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045118}],"funded_date":"2015-08-09T10:36:19Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":929015,"name":"Cora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cora is 50 years old and married with 12 children.<br \/><br \/>She works hard to provide for her family.

She is blessed with six children, three of whom depend on her and one of whom is in school. She has been working hard to earn main sources of family\u2019s income by growing cassava, sesame, and paddy rice and she has been involved in them for ten years. Moreover, she sometimes works for others for a fee in order to earn additional income. The cassava farming business grew slowly and she cannot afford to support it well. \r\n\r\nTherefore, she is now leading a group of three members to take out a new loan from VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner), which will be her second cycle loan.

Now, with their  increased capital, they are able create short and long term projects. \r\n\r\nWith the huge successes of their first loan cycle, the seven women are asking for another loan.  Amelia is a member who is seeking a loan in order to increase her textile business inventory by buying \u201ccortes\u201d (wrap-around skirts), \u201chuipiles\u201d (blouses), \u201cfajas\u201d (belts), along with typical accessories in new designs, styles and colors.  She knows there is a huge demand for these new products!  Amelia has seen her small business grow little by little over the past year which has inspired her to follow her dream of having a larger business located in a shop and to have the ability to save her profits. \r\n\r\nThe \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of Friendship Bridge, that combines small loans and education is a real asset for the women.  In their monthly meetings, a Friendship Bridge Facilitator shares valuable and useful information with the women in their own language.\r\nAmelia and the other members of \u201cOrquidea\u201d are extremely grateful to KIVA investors for giving them the opportunity to develop and expand their businesses. They are greatly honored that people outside of their country care about them and their families.

It is a very attractive area surrounded by mountains where women tend their sheep and work on their handicrafts.  Eight women who live here have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Margaritas Pales\u201d.  The average number of children of each member of the group is between 6 and 8.  They support themselves with various small businesses, like selling medicines, new clothes and animal husbandry. \r\n\r\nThirty-year old Lesly, who has only 6 years of formal education, was elected Treasurer of the group.  She has a small business selling shoes and clothes for women, children and men.  Lesly is asking Kiva lenders for a loan to increase her inventory so that she can offer more of a variety to her customers.   The profits that she earns from her increased sales help her to provide an education to her only son. \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that in Guatemala, providing a good education for one\u2019s children is one of the most important things a mother can do!  Lesly and her friends in the \u201cLas Margaritas Pales\u201d Trust Bank are asking for another line of credit in order to combat poverty  as well as provide an education for their children.  They are also very happy that, in addition to the loans they receive, they also have monthly educational lessons in various topics that can help them with their businesses, as well as help them to empower themselves. These monthly lessons are a part of the Friendship Bridge \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program that combines small loans and education.  When women are able to empower themselves through education, they help to grow their communities and raise children who are educated and healthy. Everyone has the opportunity to step into a brighter future and leave poverty behind!\r\n\r\nMany thanks to KIVA investors for helping to provide the funding that helps the women of \u201cPalestina de los Altos\u201d empower themselves and build a strong community!!!\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1945030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase her shoes inventory so that she can offer more of a variety to her customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Quetzaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.833333 -91.516667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-08-09T15:10:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-08T15:10:19Z","loan_amount":3400,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolina Vidalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lesly Judith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ilsy Lisbeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Feliciana Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maritza Rusbeli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladiz Elizabet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reina Elsira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":25900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":3400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2357.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2357.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2357.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2357.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2357.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2357.6},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2357.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2357.6},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2357.6},{"due_date":"2016-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2357.6},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2324}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.49},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.49},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.49},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.49},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.49},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.49},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.49},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":305.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":929070,"name":"Elvira Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvira Rose needs to stand on her feet after her husband died from diseases.

They all live in a five-bedroom house in Bamenda, North West Region of Cameroon. He has faced so many difficulties in life, which have been the death of his mother, brother who was his only supporter and inadequate finance to start up a business of his. His friends encouraged him to join GHAPE. He became a GHAPE member in 2006 and he has taken and repaid EC five times.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan he will buy pigs, chicks and extend his pepper plantation.  The community will benefit from his activity in that they will not spend money to go to the market to buy and will also buy at a cheaper rate.

She is a single mother, and has 3 children, who are working in fishing and harvesting mollusks.  The work she does is in breadmaking where she makes sweet cheese poundcake and pastry rings.  She also runs a small store.\r\n\r\nShe has a lot of experience in this work because she has been doing this for the past 10 years.  Due to the high poverty index of her parents, she could not study and therefore could not choose other work.  Apart from this work, she works selling pupusas on the weekends.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is requesting the loan to improve the oven and the structure where she works making the bread.

It is the main source of her family\u2019s livelihood. She\u2019s been operating this business for six years now, and she pays one worker to do the manual work. She\u2019s the one who transacts with clients and vehicle owners, does the estimation, purchasing, cashiering, and management of the shop. She also owns a tricycle that her husband, Vicente, drives as a secondary source of income. They have children who are still in elementary school, and they work hard to prepare for the huge educational expenses coming their way. \r\n\r\nLately, her compressor started to malfunction due to long-time use. She aims to buy a new one to efficiently operate her shop. She is also running out of spare parts these days. Even her own tricycle that broke down and became idle for days lacks the necessary parts to function well. \r\n\r\nThe situation diminishes their daily financial support affecting their food sustenance and allowances. She humbly asks your assistance in the amount of PHP 27,000 that she will use to buy a new compressor and spare parts. This will help sustain their everyday needs and the continuous operation of her business.

Two of them attend school. She earns her living raising pigs and poultry and has a small corral in her house. Every day she spends four hours tending the animals. After the pigs are slaughtered, the meat is sold by the pound. Celia has been doing this work for two years, and all is going well as she can work from home. Her husband buys and sells vegetables, a job he does for 6 hours daily from Tuesday to Sunday.\r\n\r\nShe is planning to use this new loan to buy pigs, special feed, vaccines etc. This is her second loan cycle with her credit group, and she is very happy as the members have helped her a great deal.

She has a small farm in her house and during certain seasons, she buys a large quantity of chickens which she raises for 2 or 3 months, until they are ready to sell.  After that time, she delivers them to some stores in the area and also sells them by the pound on foot and to customers who come to her house.  By contrast, she slaughters the pigs and then sells the meat by the pound.

Her daughters are adults now and they have their own families.  Salima went through a difficult period of time raising and feeding her children, but she always did her best, in spite of the circumstances.  <br \/><br \/>Salima is a strong and hardworking woman as well as a skilled seamstress.  Until this day, she has been sewing women's clothes in a sewing shop.  She has now acquired enough experience and she has decided to open her own business at home, since working in a workshop is not that convenient.  She wants to buy a new sewing machine, so that she can quickly start to make a living.  With this goal in mind, she is taking a loan.  In the future, Salima is dreaming of opening her own shop, where she will be sewing traditional women's outfits."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":97.51,"image":{"id":1949623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy a new sewing machine and start her own business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gissar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.524722 68.551389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-08-09T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-08T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":31.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":31.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":34.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":35.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":36.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40.37},{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":39.14},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":39.53},{"due_date":"2016-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40.84},{"due_date":"2016-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":40.51},{"due_date":"2016-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":42.98},{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.54},{"due_date":"2016-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":43.84},{"due_date":"2016-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2017-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":47.18},{"due_date":"2017-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":48.79},{"due_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":49.33},{"due_date":"2017-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50.32},{"due_date":"2017-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":51.72},{"due_date":"2017-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":56.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.77},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.93},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.38},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.37},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.14},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.53},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.84},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.51},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.98},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.54},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.84},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.18},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.79},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.33},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.32},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.72},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.58,"local_amount":31.58,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":31.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711526457},{"amount":31.58,"local_amount":31.58,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":31.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731042240},{"amount":34.35,"local_amount":34.35,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":34.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752131198}],"funded_date":"2015-08-18T05:06:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":929230,"name":"Farida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farida is a generous woman.

Thanks to Babban Gona's support, Yakubu now has the opportunity to increase his yields and income and use his extra earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1949996,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase improved farm inputs that will increase farmers' yields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-08-10T00:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-09T00:40:04Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yakubu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":54621,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":54621}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-22T15:59:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":929314,"name":"Maria Aileen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Provinces in the Visayas region of the Philippines were hit hard by Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013. Almost all businesses in those areas dwindled if they did not go bankrupt. Entrepreneurs worked hard to recover and rehabilitate their businesses. \u201cSari-sari\u201d or variety stores were not exempted from that crisis. Frequent distribution of relief goods to Haiyan affected communities almost crushed the variety stores, because the commodities that the people need everyday were supplied to them through relief goods. It was several months after Haiyan when variety stores rose again. \r\n\r\nMaria Aileen from Bacolod City, Negros Occidental is one of those variety store owners. It\u2019s good that she also owns a tricycle being driven by her husband, Randy, which gives additional income for the family. Somehow the income derived from her tricycle is reliable and constant. But today it needs troubleshooting and maintenance. Maria Aileen knocks at your kind hearts to lend her PHP 60,000 which she will use to buy spare parts for her tricycle and pay for its maintenance. She will also add stocks of variety store items like snacks, toiletries and beverages. Hope you are willing to help her as she continuously strengthens her business. Her profit will sustain their everyday needs and educational expenses of her two children. She would like to see them with a college diploma and stable career someday.\r\n\r\nMaria Aileen is a devoted member of CCT Credit Cooperative and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":552.15,"image":{"id":1950001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

These will help him earn yields of up to 30 bags of maize\/ hectare, double the national average in Nigeria. This will see him increase his income considerably.\r\n\r\nThis season Usman has ambitious plans to harvest 40 bags of maize.
