She was there for a time, but later she travelled to the city of Bogot\u00e1, and when she returned two years later, she started the same business again. Every day, starting at 5 in the morning, Carmen opens the doors of her business and offers snacks made from corn, such as egg arepas, empanadas, stuffed potatoes, patacones as well as hallacas and pork and chicken pastries. Right now, she is applying for her first Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, in order to buy a grill, a fryer and produce to make the food. With this investment, she thinks she will improve her sales and expand her product line. Her goal in the future is to have a business as prosperous as she had in previous years, so that she can achieve her personal goal of building two apartments in her home and rent them out."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":99.92,"image":{"id":1945762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a grill, a fryer and produce to make food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-08-10T12:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-09T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1230000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88134},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91362},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":93646},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":95988},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":98387},{"due_date":"2016-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100847},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":103368},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105952},{"due_date":"2016-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108601},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":111316},{"due_date":"2016-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114099},{"due_date":"2016-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.26},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.12},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.9},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.82},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.76},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.73},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.74},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.66,"local_amount":179496,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":187895.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730994673},{"amount":34.26,"local_amount":93646,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:23:51Z","rounded_local_amount":98028.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752082627}],"funded_date":"2015-09-09T12:21:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":926495,"name":"Ana Ofelia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana, de 64 a\u00f1os de edad, es una persona muy luchadora, debido a los escasos recursos, no asisti\u00f3 a la escuela, pero aprendi\u00f3 a firmar, desde peque\u00f1a le ayudaba a sus padres a elaborar petates y les ayudaba en los trabajos agr\u00edcolas, en su casa solo vive con su nuera, un hijo y un nieto, porque su hijo mayor emigro a los Estados Unidos hace poco tiempo.\n\nAna, actualmente se dedica a elaborar petates y para comprar los materiales que necesita tiene camina una hora hasta el lugar donde cosechan el tule y como no tiene ning\u00fan medio de transporte, tiene que cargar la materia prima en la cabeza hasta su casa.\n\nAna, est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar tule, porque actualmente no tiene dinero para comprarlo, de esta manera ella podr\u00e1 continuar con su negocio y su trabajo no se paralizara.\n\nElla sue\u00f1a con volver a ver a su hijo que est\u00e1 en Estados Unidos.\n","en":"Ana is 64 years old.

This type of work allows her to generate resources to support her family economically since she is single and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she replies that she likes the training and the health center that the institution offers.

She was born in the village of Kurush. She is the caring mother of five children, and the beloved grandmother of six grandchildren. Since she was born in a rural location, she has been used to hard work since her childhood. And in spite of everything she has always striven to achieve everything through her own efforts and hard work.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from secondary school she was married to a farmer. He used to grow crops. She did not want to sit at home with idle hands and spend her husband's earnings; she wanted to help her husband in supporting the family and, having saved his money, to start an additional business fattening, buying and selling cattle. But unfortunately her husband died in a car accident and she was left a widow at the very dawn of her life, and all her plans and dreams collapsed in a single moment.\r\n\r\nShe was not able to recover for a long time and to believe what had happened. Since Sanoat was a woman strong in spirit, she understood that her children need her and that she must raise them, educate them, and marry them off according to Tajik tradition. She worked for everyone's sake. She gave them an education and married them off. Now her children have become a support for her, and Sanoat's dreams of creating a home business have been renewed. All of her sons work as farmers. Sanoat stays at home and fattens cattle. Now she wants to increase her herd of cattle, and she has applied to Arvand for a loan. On receiving the loan, she will buy some cattle for fattening and resale."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":241.01,"image":{"id":1937251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy some cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-08-10T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-09T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanoat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":9600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":738.85},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":753.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":761.55},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":817.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":829.81},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":860.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":898.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":930.56},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":956.76},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000.77},{"due_date":"2016-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1051.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.92},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.98},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.95},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.04},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.25},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.48},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.58},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":119.29,"local_amount":738.85,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":746.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731040500},{"amount":121.72,"local_amount":753.88,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":761.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755520172}],"funded_date":"2015-09-09T18:18:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":929761,"name":"Zarina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zarina is a 55-year-old mother with four children who lives in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

She has sold caramel and cosmetics for more than fifteen years, while married, and now has a four year old child.  She is studying for a degree in teaching with a specialization in Spanish, and works as an academic secretary.  All of this is to guarantee a good future for her child and to meet the goals she has always had, among them to obtain work as a teacher.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, this 33 year old entrepreneur seeks a loan to pay the final fees to register her degree.  Once this phase is complete, she will finally have her degree and can opt to be a teacher.  Fortunately she has the support of her husband, who works as a mason, which allows her to feel secure in following her dreams.  Cecilia also plans to take an English class in the future, as she never tires of continuing her education.

Ever since she was a young girl, she has always helped her father and taken care of farm animals.  Thanks to him, she has acquired a good deal of experience and she now has her own business.  \r\n\r\nGulnoza bought her first cow with some money sent from Russia by her husband.  Gradually, she has been able to increase her livestock headcount and she currently has one cow and two young bulls.  Her business is now the family's main source of income.  At the moment, though, her farming business is going through some difficult times due to the decline of cattle prices.  Gulnoza needs to buy livestock feed, but she cannot afford to sell any of her animals because of the current low prices.  Faced with this difficult situation, she has decided to turn to MDO Arvand for some support.  She is planning to use her loan to buy animal feed as well as a young cow at a low price."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":187.71,"image":{"id":1937213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy animal feed and a young cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

Gradually though, he acquired a good deal of experience and he now has his own animal husbandry business.  <br \/><br \/>The experience Abdujalil acquired from his father really helped him increase his cattle headcount and he currently has seven cows.  Since cattle prices are very low at the moment, he wants to buy a few additional young cows.  However, because he has invested all his savings in his business, he cannot afford to buy any cattle at the moment. Faced with this situation, he has decided to turn to MDO Arvand for some support.  Abdujalil will be using his loan to buy some cattle."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":171.01,"image":{"id":1938232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy some cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.
