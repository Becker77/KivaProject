This is the principle of Gemma, 54, from Calumpang, General Santos City, South Cotabato who prepares and sells banana cue and camote (sweet potato) cue in a stall near a city high school in their community. Banana cue is made from \u201csaba\u201d (a type of banana) while camote cue is sweet potato, deeply fried and coated with caramelized sugar. Two to three pieces are skewered on a bamboo stick which is usually more than enough of a serving for one person. This is appealing for students because a one-stick serving sold at a meager price fills the stomach. The increasing demand for her product led her to employ four helpers. Therefore her business not only sustains her family\u2019s needs but also the needs of her four helpers. In this way, she is a blessing to them.\r\n\r\nAs a faithful member of the Baptist Church, she aims to continue being a blessing to others through her business. She applied for a PHP 25,000 loan to buy more bananas, sweet potatoes, sugar, and cooking oil for her food stall business. She hopes you could help her as she strives to help others too. \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s married to Jesus and they are blessed with five children.

economic condition. His family was fairly large and had few resources. His children are now adults and have their own families. He lives with his wife and a granddaughter.\r\n\r\nArmando works in agriculture during the winter season. He grows corn on two blocks of land. He learned this from his father. In addition, in the evenings he works in a lake near his some. He does artisanal fishing, which he also learned from his father. His other brothers also work in the same activity. He does this almost every day in the afternoon and into the night, as it is easier to do during that time.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

The town is known for its cotton weavings, palm hats and adobe bricks.  They are also known for selling oils, paints and soaps.  <br \/><br \/>A dedicated group of small businesswomen formed the local Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201c15 de Enero\u201d (January 15th).  The women, besides wanting micro-credit loans to develop their small businesses, also have dreams of empowering themselves and eliminating poverty in their lives. They have formed \u201c15 de Enero\u201d to expand their small businesses, increase profits and meet their household expenses, including sending their children to school,.<br \/> <br \/>Santos is 32 years old and was elected President of the group.  Her business is animal husbandry, especially raising pigs.  She is requesting a loan to buy four more pigs to raise and the sell to restaurants.  Santos shares her earnings with her children, who are all attending school.  Her desire and expectation is that they all reach a high level of education, a goal that she was unable to attain. <br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, the majority of the women who make up \u201c15 de Enero\u201d were unable to attend school.  Like most Mayan women, they were required from early childhood to work hard and help meet the financial needs of their families. The skills they learned as children provided the foundation for them to develop a strong work ethic, and perhaps their own businesses as they got older. The educational component of the \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of Friendship Bridge (small loans + education) gave them the tools to learn and polish business skills (pricing, marketing, accounting, budgeting, customer service), leadership, self-esteem and empowerment, as well as hygiene, health and women\u2019s rights. Like a plant in need of water and fertilizer, the \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program gives them essential nutrients to grow and expand in their personal and business lives.<br \/><br \/>The women of \u201c15 de Enero\u201d are very grateful to all the KIVA investors from around the world who have generously provided funds for these essential loans.

Chibombo District, Zambia. <br \/><br \/>He is asking for a Kiva loan to buy a maize milling machine so that he can provide milling service to over 150 families in his community. The maize milling machine takes raw maize (corn) and creates a maize flour, which is the staple food in Zambia. Most rural families in Chibombo District grow maize on their small farms and store it for use as their primary supply of food for the year. After the kernels are removed from the cob, they then have to be milled to create flour, which can then be boiled to make what is locally called nshima. <br \/><br \/>Rent-to-Own has done market research in Fabian's community and has determined that the location for this equipment is good. There is a maize mill about 1.5 km away, but it is often broken down. Equipment such as a maize mill can be a major boost for many enterprising farmers such as Fabian, as it allows him to diversify his business.

In the future, Maribeth would like to save enough money to send her children to college.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":90,"image":{"id":1951948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy items to sell in her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Ubay, Bohol","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2015-08-11T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-10T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":240}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36,"local_amount":1440,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T17:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1646.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711554517},{"amount":24,"local_amount":960,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-26T12:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1097.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":735191485},{"amount":30,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-23T13:49:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1371.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":754980693}],"funded_date":"2015-08-15T14:57:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Steven Soltesz","image":null}},{"id":926708,"name":"Albertina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Albertina vive y trabaja en Colomi, de estado civil casada, tiene 3 hijos dependientes que estudian en el colegio.

old and single.  She has two children who depend on her financially.  She lives in Cochabamba and makes her living raising livestock for milk production.  She owns her cattle and has run her business for 6 years.  She has sufficient experience to confront any issue, and relies on the help of her partner and their children to carry out the business.  Her partner also works providing home electrical services as a master electrician.  Both jobs provide income.  Both partners are very responsible people who really want to improve their lives.\r\n\r\nMandy seeks a loan to provide economic support, as they had unexpected costs in acquiring a tool for her partner's job.  The loan she requests is for the purchase of supplies (soybean husks) for her cattle, as they have little forage of their own due to climate conditions.  For this reason she needs to buy dry feed to keep production from falling and decreasing her income level, in order to protect the well being of her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":187.62,"image":{"id":1946106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies (forage, soybean husks) to feed her cattle, increase her income, and improve the economic condition of her family.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2015-08-11T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-10T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mandy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2016-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2016-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2016-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2016-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2017-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2017-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2017-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2017-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2017-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125.05,"local_amount":850.36,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":856.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730962287},{"amount":62.57,"local_amount":425.5,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":428.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752051372}],"funded_date":"2015-09-09T22:33:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Hiller","image":null}},{"id":930189,"name":"Leah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leah is a married woman who has four children.

She says that she is a new member of ProMujer, and was invited to join during a massive promotion the institution conducted in her area. Currently, she has a business selling cosmetics, and says that she started this business a year ago with her friend\u2019s help.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan she is taking out now to increase capital (to purchase wholesale cologne and perfume), which she will acquire from wholesalers in El Alto, and later market at her sales stand.  This type of work permits her to generate income to support her family financially as she is unmarried and has a son.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she liked about ProMujer, she replied that she likes the health benefits and training the institution offers.  \r\nSimona doesn\u2019t appear in the photo because, after making the payment, she had to get to her sales stand.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1965.51,"image":{"id":1946165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase wholesale cologne and perfume.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2015-08-11T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-10T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":3025,"lender_count":102,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jahel Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anahi Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maragarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julio Edgar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":20576,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3224.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3291.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3380.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3473.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3566.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3639.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":474.02},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":497.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":510.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":524.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":535.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":957.9,"local_amount":6515.63,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":6561.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711481972},{"amount":497.01,"local_amount":3380.68,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3404.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731000505},{"amount":510.6,"local_amount":3473.08,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3497.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752088742}],"funded_date":"2015-08-17T16:02:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Francoletti-Putz","image":null}},{"id":926732,"name":"Mariposas De Oro Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cMARIPOSAS DE ORO\u201d iniciar\u00e1 el primer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Panamericana, est\u00e1 compuesta por ocho  integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Elsa es la Presidenta.

","en":"Sadokat is a young 27-year-old woman who lives in a rural location. Sadokat has been rearing animals for the past five years. She buys young cattle and, having fattened them up, sells them for a higher price. Sadokat began rearing animals after she got married. Seeing that it was difficult for her husband to provide for the family on his own, she decided to buy a couple of heads of cattle and then sold them on after having fattened them up for a couple of months. She bought more cattle with the money and thus was able to increase her herd gradually.\r\n\r\nSadokat's husband works in construction on a private construction site and goes to Russia to work seasonally, but the money that he earns is insufficient to provide for all the family's needs. At the present time Sadokat's business is the main source of income for their family. Now Sadokat has some financial problems due to the fall in the price of cattle.

hard-working 35-year-old man. He is married and has two children. Abbos and his family live in a small little village. He worked with his father in the fields from a young age, and learned how to graze livestock. Since then he has learned a lot and now he is engaged in such a business himself. In order to have a regular income for food, Abbos runs his own business. He fattens and resells cattle.

In her late 40s, Lav lives in Mondulkiri province where she has been growing cassava as the main source of income for years. In addition, she is working on her co-villager\u2019s farm for a fee to supplement her income. The cassava farming was in danger as the plants were destroyed by pests, which caused her to earn less income than before. <br \/><br \/>This will be Lav\u2019s third loan with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

The women in the group, Manjula and Latha, come from similar backgrounds, working hard to sustain their families. They have no access to toilets, and therefore have to resort to open defecation using the false privacy of nearby fields and surrounding shrubbery. These families, especially their women and daughters, are subsequently at risk of infection, molestation, and even insect or animal bites.\n\nAccess to a toilet will mean privacy and peace of mind for Marudhambal and family. It will also mean they no longer need to walk long distances, especially when they are sick. So, together, they seek a loan of Rs. 42000 to build a toilet at home.
