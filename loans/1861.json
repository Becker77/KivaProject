But this has not been an obstacle for her in spite of the fact that her mother died a few years ago.   <br \/><br \/>Currently Bernardita is a public employee. She has been for two years but she has also always raised small animals. For this reason at this time she wants to start raising and selling pigs as this will help her a lot with her finances. Plus she enjoys this activity a lot. She learned it from her parents when she was quite small. They have been an example of constant striving for her. <br \/><br \/>Today she is requesting a loan to begin her dream as right now demand is very good and this will help her improve her revenues. <br \/><br \/>She came to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa through very good references and she wants to profoundly thank those who form part of this noble institution and have opened the door for her to fulfill her needs. She is grateful to Kiva for making possible the growth in her personal and family life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":153.28,"image":{"id":1946776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

For that reason she has decided to ask for a loan to buy more jewelry products because getting loans is the only way to prosper.\r\nJuana's biggest dream is to be able to grow her business to create jobs in the community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":262.67,"image":{"id":1946753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy jewelry products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2015-08-12T07:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-11T07:30:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita Rafaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesica Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara Lucrecia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.54,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:21:18Z","rounded_local_amount":669.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711385649},{"amount":87.59,"local_amount":667.39,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":670.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731215739},{"amount":87.54,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":669.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752001222}],"funded_date":"2015-08-24T01:02:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susie Jackson","image":null}},{"id":927153,"name":"Gwizumugisha Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Am\u00e9lie  fait partie du groupe  Gwizumugisha  et  habite \u00e0  Gitega.

Thabitha has six children whom she adores and cherishes, and a handsome husband who always paints a smile on Thabitha's face. Thabitha has been practicing mixed farming for the past three years, and is making great strides. She has been able to earn a decent and honest living through milk and egg selling, and personal business. These ventures have enabled her to send her children to school and feed her family. Thabitha has planted many trees on her compound, and also has Napier grass, which has high protein and is used to feed her dairy cow, thereby enhancing her milk-selling profits. Because of increased demand, Thabitha is kindly requesting a loan to buy a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is a very profitable venture, and she wants to take full advantage of the ready market for dairy products. Through the loan, Thabitha is sure of satisfying the demand for milk in her area. Through increased profits, Thabitha is sure that she will repay the loan on time and also be in a position to comfortably take care of her family.

She has a business making blouses. She is a good mother, and is independent, stable, dedicated, responsible and very hard working. She works in the district of Sacaba on the outskirts of the city. This area is currently experiencing growth due to its commercial potential. The climate is temperate, and daytime temperatures vary between 6 and 21 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nNilda has olive skin, dark eyes and long black hair. She is short and slim. Her mother tongue is Quechua, which she speaks at home. She also speaks Spanish, especially in her business. She shares her life with her partner, who works in construction, and her children, who are not yet old enough to go to school. They live in their own home, which is under construction. It is made of bricks and cement, with a corrugated iron roof and cement floors. It has electricity and well water.\r\n\r\nNilda works making blouses, a skill she learned from her mother, and currently works alone. She has never lived in a house with drinking water, a service which is new in her area. She currently collects water from a well manually using a bucket and rope. She says that \"the water we use is not clean, it's full of soil and it is not drinkable\". The advantage of her home is that the area already has a drinking water supply. However, she does not have enough money to connect the supply to her kitchen, bathroom and washroom.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to finish building her home. She wants to install drinking water in her kitchen, bathroom and washroom so that her family can live a healthy life.

of Barotac Viejo, Iloilo. She is currently running a store which offers usual commodities that are needed in an individual\u2019s daily life. Her income from the business helps sustain the everyday necessities of her family. With her husband, Rogel, who is a carpenter, they willingly provide for the basic needs of their two children. One is studying in college, while the other is still in elementary school. <br \/><br \/>However, running a store like this is not as easy as others usually think. Income varies every day depending on how many customers will avail the products. Their profit in each day seems to be insufficient. In this situation, Rosana wants to ask help from you. She is requesting for a PHP 20,000 loan that she will use to buy more groceries, toiletries and canned goods for her store. She is truly hopeful that this amount will help her attract more customers and will then lead to a higher profit.<br \/><br \/>She dreams of growing her business and have a better living condition someday. She would love to see her children finish their studies and gain stable careers. She is a compliant member of CCT Credit Cooperative and meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to inspire and strengthen each other through the Word of God. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":281.25,"image":{"id":1952220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more groceries, toiletries and canned goods for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Barotac Viejo, Iloilo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-08-12T13:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-11T13:00:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":206.25,"local_amount":9166.63,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":9471.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955297},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.32,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3444.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045141}],"funded_date":"2015-09-09T21:02:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Bradshaw","image":1722852}},{"id":930474,"name":"Luzviminda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luzviminda is a married woman with three children.

sources of income. Jessie, 36, from Calumpang, General Santos City, South Cotabato runs a variety store that sells toiletries, repacked condiments, snack items, canned goods, eggs, and many other items. \r\n\r\nJessie earns extra income from load retailing or e-loading for cellphones. This business is very popular now in the Philippines because most cellphone owners use a prepaid plan and only a few subscribe to a postpaid plan. In a prepaid arrangement, a person can budget his load usage because he can buy as little as a 10-peso load. It is indeed a good business to combine with a variety store. \r\n\r\nBasically Jessie\u2019s income helps provide for his family\u2019s daily needs. But his forward-looking mindset drives him to improve his business in order to save more for his children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nJessie would like to obtain additional capital worth PHP 20,000 that he can use to buy more products for his store and load wallets for cellphone e-loading. The earnings that he can derive from this will add to the regular wage of his wife, Maritess, a government employee. They can continually provide for the needs of their family and schooling of their two children. Both of them want to see their children finish their college degrees and acquire stable jobs someday. \r\n\r\nJessie gains inspiration from his co-fellowship* members who meet every week to share stories of their lives and businesses and draw strength from the Word of God. *All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her husband died several years ago, and from then on, she alone has shouldered the responsibility for her children.<br \/><br \/>Hidenia provides their daily needs through selling of seafood in a public market located in Barotac Viejo, Iloilo. She offers crabs, clams and snails, which are very saleable in the market. But Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013 devastated their area and resulted in the dwindling of her business. She gradually restored it with the unwavering support of her children. Her co-fellowship* members at CCT Credit Cooperative also contributed a lot through their inspiring stories and Bible reflections. <br \/><br \/>As Hidenia continues to develop her business, she needs additional capital of PHP 18,000 to obtain more seafood and increase her buying power this rainy season when seafood is scarce and expensive. Your generous assistance will surely help her business prosper. <br \/><br \/>Hidenia dreams of a little comfort in life as she ages. She wants that all her children will live happily and peacefully. She gains inspiration and strength from her co-fellowship members who meet every week to share stories about their lives and businesses.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250.05,"image":{"id":1952325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more seafood, such as crabs, clams and snails.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Barotac Viejo, Iloilo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-08-12T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-11T13:20:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hidenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100.02,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4592.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434374},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3826.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955299},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3061.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045143}],"funded_date":"2015-08-21T23:43:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Bradshaw","image":1722852}},{"id":930484,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda is a married and 48 years old.

She receives tips on how to manage her variety store and retailing of charcoal. Her store sells various commodities such as rice, canned goods, snack items, toiletries, condiments, and many others. Simultaneously she buys sacks of charcoal, repacks it per kilo, then sells it by customer order or as part of her store inventory. She really works hard in order to supplement her financial resources. Her husband, Margarito, is a farmer whose income doesn\u2019t suffice for the growing expenses of her family with two children, one of whom is studying in high school while the other is still in elementary level.\r\n\r\nShe aims to expand her variety store and charcoal vending. She requests 20,000 PHP for this purpose. She hopes that your help will bring positive steps towards her dream of having a successful business. In due time, she plans to buy a piece of land for her family because she considers it as a good investment that increases in value as time passes by. She also dreams that her children will gain a stable job after finishing their college education.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

He is married and has two small children. He is from a place located in the north of the region called Malpaisillo. He is known for being hardworking and responsible with the energy to get ahead in the world. Unfortunately, due to a lack of money, he was unable to study at university and was instead forced to work from a very young age in order to support his family with the household expenses. He is now fighting to move his business in the right direction.   \r\n\r\nThanks to his energy and desire to get ahead, Mariano now makes and sells artisan crafts such as piggy banks, clay pots, jugs, ashtray, etc. He set this business up five years ago in his home and has been running it since. The purpose of the loan is to invest money into his work and stock his business. Mariano is thankful for all the help the Kiva lenders provide people with limited resources and people from poor countries such as Nicaragua as this support allows these people have decent jobs.   \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":231.27,"image":{"id":1947533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy artisan crafts such as jugs, vases and ashtrays to later sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Telica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2015-08-12T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-11T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.16,"local_amount":2166.42,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2194.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711519884},{"amount":77.08,"local_amount":2083.36,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-24T12:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2110.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":733233775},{"amount":74.03,"local_amount":2000.21,"processed_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:50:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2026.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752310089}],"funded_date":"2015-08-24T14:03:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elliot Bevan","image":null}},{"id":930577,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nancy is a 19-year-old single lady who started selling cosmetics and giving tutorials three years ago to cover her needs and expenses due to the low financial situation of her family.

His wife is a housewife. His dream is to have a good family, to prepare for his children's futures and to build a permanent house for his family with the revenue from his livestock business. Because he never went to school, Moutian turned to RMCR for financial aid so he could increase the number of sheep he keeps as livestock. He gets his supplies from the local village markets and resells his livestock at these same markets. His projected monthly profit stands at 82,000 FCFA. He has been raising livestock for four years.

This is Charles. He is the Deputy Head teacher of Light Mixed Primary School, a mixed school in the rural area of Nauyo in Mbale with 800 students. Light Mixed School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nLight Mixed School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Charles ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1952708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mbale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.064444 34.179444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-08-12T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-11T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Light Mixed School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3035000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:12:56Z","rounded_local_amount":618647.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755507282}],"funded_date":"2015-08-12T19:32:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":930580,"name":"Zakia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zakia is 39 years old and married.

This is Leo. He is the head teacher of Royal Academy School, a mixed school in the rural area of Lira with 500 students. Royal Academy School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750-liter tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nRoyal Academy School will repay its loan from its school fees, which they collect each term. Leo ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children who fall sick from water-borne diseases, as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":185,"image":{"id":1952715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-08-12T17:50:29Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-11T17:50:29Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Royal Academy School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3235000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":647000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":647000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":647000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":647000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":647000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":185,"local_amount":647000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":653999.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755507283}],"funded_date":"2015-08-13T13:21:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JenniferN"}},{"id":930604,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary, aged 46, is a mother of five.

Her husband is also helping her in promoting the business. Through this business, she earns a monthly income of about 6,500 INR, which is just $100. Her opinion is that, from this small income, it is very difficult to maintain her family. After that, to get sufficient surplus to reinvest in the business is practically impossible. So, she formed a group for strengthening social relations and to access a loan for the expansion of her business.<br \/><br \/>She planned to purchase seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. for the vegetable cultivation business, as well as potatoes, onions, garlic, ginger, cauliflower, carrots, radishes, apples, bananas, etc. for her vegetables and fruits business. She hopes it will definitely improve her sales; she will get more and more profit from her business expansion and save money for construction of her own house. She wishes to enroll her son in a public school for better education. <br \/><br \/>The other ten members of the group are also smart at their professions and also are actively engaged in different professions like a grocery shop, daily needs and cosmetics shop, rice business, tailoring business, hotel, cloth store, and milk business.

The challenges that she fights for are to provide a better life for her children and provide them the opportunities they deserve as people.  She also fights to move her business forward, and to make it grow every day through her perseverance, one of her strongest characteristics.  In this manner she will achieve her goals and objectives in the short term.\r\n\r\nDue to her desire to better herself, she works in new clothes sales in an established venue in her community.  She began the business sixteen years ago as a street vendor.

She works twelve hours every day, offering products such as pants, jeans, blouses, tee shirts, skirts, dresses, underwear, bedding, children's clothes, etc.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to invest in work capital and stock her business though purchasing merchandise to meet the demands of her customers and take advantage of the local festivals, so that in the not too distant future she can increase her income.\r\n\r\nAlva is grateful to the Kiva investors who offer a means of dignified work to people of scarce resources and from poor countries such as Nicaragua."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":368.76,"image":{"id":1947576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise such as pants, shorts, dresses, skirts, blouses, tee shirts, bedding, children's clothes and underwear.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2015-08-12T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-11T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alva Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":246.01,"local_amount":6671.37,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-24T12:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6735.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":733233784},{"amount":122.75,"local_amount":3328.62,"processed_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3360.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752310093}],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T18:07:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Hiller","image":null}},{"id":927280,"name":"Juan Alejandro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan  tiene 66 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado, sin hijos, vive  en una zona rural del distrito de Oyot\u00fan, provincia de Chiclayo, regi\u00f3n Lambayeque, costa norte de Per\u00fa.

Currently, she\u2019s managing a sari-sari store, a Filipino word which means \u201cvariety\u201d where it\u2019s somehow similar to a convenience store, but it has grills instead of walls or glass where the items are being displayed and products are measured by kilos, pieces and volumes.\r\n\r\nDina aims to have a one one-stop-shop where she can offer products on demand and complete items.

Her opinion is that from this small income it is very difficult to maintain her family. After that, to get sufficient surplus to reinvest in the business is practically impossible. <br \/><br \/>In the current market situation, the competition is also very high. Another big investment is necessary for the expansion of business. Fund scarcity is the main concern. So she formed a group for strengthening social relations and to avail a loan for the expansion of her business. It will be their fourth loan cycle.<br \/><br \/>Rebati planned to purchase four tailoring machines and a Pico machine. She will also appoint two employees to make dresses so as to meet the demands of customers.

Currently she owns three cows, ten sheep, and two horses, and raises beans on 2.59 hectares. She also sells organic milk, and in the summer stores vegetables and fruit which she can then sell during winter. Kulzhakan is known as a good, responsible, and joyful person. To further develop her business Kulzhakan came to the Bai-Tushum bank for a 150,000 som (KGS) loan to buy two dairy cows to increase the amount of milk she can sell. Part of the money will also go to harvesting and preparing potatoes and strawberries for sale. She plans to reinvest proceeds from use of the loan back into her business.

He owns a small piece of land together with his lovely wife, and they have been blessed with six children. On the land, they have kept dairy cattle and grown vegetables for five years. Their main income sources are milk and crops. They recently ventured into a small side hustle business. <br \/><br \/>From Kiva lenders, Alexander is seeking a loan worth KES 20,000 to buy seeds and grow his horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. <br \/><br \/>It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to afford Alexander access to a loan facility that will aid him to grow his horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Alexander\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":47.06,"image":{"id":1941949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seeds and expand his horticulture farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-12T21:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-11T21:50:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.57},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.35},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.83},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.27,"local_amount":1727.23,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1748.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711507170},{"amount":29.79,"local_amount":2978.77,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3015.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024013}],"funded_date":"2015-08-13T06:40:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":928281,"name":"Mariano","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mariano, con el cr\u00e9dito anterior obtuvo una cosecha de granos b\u00e1sicos muy abundante y sin problemas de plagas, tiene estabilidad econ\u00f3mica y ha podido iniciar la venta de helados para tener otros ingresos. \nHace la solicitud de un nuevo cr\u00e9dito para comprar insumos agr\u00edcolas con los que podr\u00e1 realizar la siembra de granos b\u00e1sicos, adem\u00e1s invertir\u00e1 un poco en cajas de sorbete, fortalecer\u00e1 su negocio para ir teniendo ingresos con los que cumplir\u00e1 con sus obligaciones. \n","en":"With his previous loan, Mariano obtained a very plentiful harvest and had no problems with pests.

With his loan, he intends to make a purchase of high-quality bean seed so that he will have a good germination, organic fertilizers that will help him improve the condition of the organic material in the soil, and other products to apply during planting, growing and harvesting. In addition, he will pay for manual labor for soil preparation, work that will help him prevent the rain water from causing erosion damage, and also to apply the products and assist with the crop once it is growing. In this way, he will ensure that he does a good job. <br \/><br \/>His intention is to take advantage of the good climate and soil conditions that the region has for this crop, and also to put into practice his several years of experience in managing staple crops. In addition, he will be able to buy the best and highest-quality products so that his crop will have good growth, health, and a proper yield, and to have significant production in the short term. <br \/><br \/>He wants to use the income from the harvest that he expects to obtain for the wellbeing and education of his family, to achieve some family goals, and to continue investing more in his crops.

that offers hills and the dam are what characterize the municipality in addition to the customs which still prevail from the Mazateca culture so that almost 90% of the adult population speaks Mazatec and Spanish. One of the colonies in the municipality formed a group called Chuparrosa for the beauty of the female hummingbird (chupamirto) since, looking at it, one finds peace and inspiration. The group is made up of:\r\n\r\nAdolfo - dough\r\nSidronio \u2013bream \r\nAna, Juliana, Angela \u2013 snacks \r\nAngelica \u2013 bakery \r\nAlondra \u2013 cosmetics and lingerie from a catalog\r\nLilia \u2013 food and soft drinks\r\n\r\nLilia is 40 years old, and says that she only went to school for 4 years because her parents couldn't cover the household expenses and those of education. She is married to Marco, with whom she has 5 children of whom only 2 depend economically on them. \"That my children go to school and have a good quality of life is what motivated me to begin selling soft drinks and food 5 years ago,\" are the words of Lili, as she is known in the community.  She says that her husband's salary was not enough and she didn't want history to repeat itself with her children.\r\n\r\nFor 5 years, she has worked selling food and soft drinks and says that she began just with soft drinks, chips and cookies, but with the passing of the months, the teachers at the primary and secondary school began to ask her for food and then she began, with the help of her husband and using part of the earnings she got, built a small structure where she set up her refrigerator for the soft drinks, the chips, and cookies, and 5 tables and a burner where  she makes the food. What she cooks are bream - fried, in soup, wrapped, or with chipotle, satisfying her customers and she also prepares chicken, steak, and cutlets depending on what is ordered. \r\n\r\nHer small kitchen offers service from Monday to Friday from 8 in the morning to 6 in the evening, her husband helps her find firewood, clean the bream, and set up and clean the tables and chairs.\r\n\r\nFor Lili, the support that her family offers her is the principal motivation because she says that she is working for them, each one of the granted loans has been useful since by investing them in her kitchen, it encourages its growth. This time, the loan will be invested in the purchase of oil, meat, vegetables, cream, cheese, soft drinks, chips and two tables.  \r\n\r\n\"Every one of the loans has had a positive impact on each of our businesses, so we are grateful to those who make it possible for our loans to be granted, so that we and our customers benefit.\"  These are the words with which the group expresses its gratitude.\r\n\r\n*These are the members of the Chuparrosa group, the photo was taken at the Novia del Sol.

On the way to get to this community, one can appreciate the large fields of sugar cane, corn and beans.

Animal husbandry, however, is maintained among the most common activities for the local people. \r\n \r\nThe Las Agradables is from the community and is made up of Julia, who works selling groceries and sugar cane: Crisitina, clothing from catalogs; Reyna and Daira, cosmetics: Dulce household items; Paula groceries; while Jairo has an electrcial shop and Agust\u00edn provides a taxi service.  \r\n\r\nAgust\u00edn has been behind the wheel for 37 years, doing his work as a taxi driver, going around the different zones in his community with the objective of offering the best service to his customers. With a base of great effort and sacrifice, he went from being employed to being his own boss and has worked with his own vehicle for 30 years. One of the situations that he enjoys the most of his job is interacting with customers. For this, he offers his service from 5:00 am to 9:00 pm. After this time, his trips have a different cost but his customers don't hesitate to call him due to his great quality and professionalism. \r\n\r\nWith previous loans, he has been able to do general maintenance to the car in addition to changing the tires. This time, he has asked for the loan to get an electrical and mechanical adjustment on the vehicle. These days, he has two objective in mind: get a new taxi and open a grocery store. This would help him to increase his income and improve his quality of life. \r\n\r\n\u201cThank you for trusting in us, granting us loans to invest in our businesses so that we gradually make our dreams possible,\" are works that Agust\u00edn shares along with the members of his group. \r\n\r\n*In the photo, in addition to seeing the members of the group, Agust\u00edn's taxi is also visible.

However, to be able to cover the household expenses and the education of his four children, he decided to sell pineapples within his community. He offers the fruit whole, in juice, or prepared with lemon and spices. So, every afternoon he roams the streets of his area, riding a tricycle to offer his merchandise to the passersby. In the mornings, he sets up his business outside of a commercial store where the fluidity of the people favors the success of his job. \r\n\r\nAs for the loans he has gotten, he has always shown a commendable responsibility as he has had four so far with VFM\u00e9xico. On this occasion, he will use the loan to buy more pineapples, chili powder, and plastic bags. He says, \"Thank you for believing in us, for helping us to reach our dreams. May God bless you today and always.\" One of Felipe's goals is to put a store on the patio of his house to sell traditional appetizers such as fruit cocktails, prepared pork rinds, and ears of corn or popcorn with the grains of corn. \r\n\r\n*The photo was taken in front of Eva's house.

Their hopes are to change people\u2019s lives for the better through their kindness, faith and inspirational business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":469.49,"image":{"id":1937522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a mobile storage unit for business products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Virginia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2015-08-13T00:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-12T00:00:26Z","loan_amount":4375,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rubin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4355,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":4375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":156.43},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":160.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":160.73},{"due_date":"2015-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":164.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":165.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":167.39},{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":172.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":172.01},{"due_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":175.61},{"due_date":"2016-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":176.73},{"due_date":"2016-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":180.24},{"due_date":"2016-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":181.58},{"due_date":"2016-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":184.04},{"due_date":"2016-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":187.41},{"due_date":"2016-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":189.09},{"due_date":"2016-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":192.36},{"due_date":"2017-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":194.27},{"due_date":"2017-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":196.91},{"due_date":"2017-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":200.93},{"due_date":"2017-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":202.31},{"due_date":"2017-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":205.33},{"due_date":"2017-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":207.85},{"due_date":"2017-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":210.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.27},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.07},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.47},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.91},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.16},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.29},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.8},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.42},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.54},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.07},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.41},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.89},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.27},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.96},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.24},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.16},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.81},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.85},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.24},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.27},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.8},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":308.42,"local_amount":307.01,"processed_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":308.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730908621},{"amount":161.07,"local_amount":160.33,"processed_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:11:44Z","rounded_local_amount":161.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":751999794}],"funded_date":"2015-09-09T21:00:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":923455,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is a strong, positive woman and an inspiration to others due to her perseverance in the face of many challenges.

She is a 39-year-old businesswoman and a wife of Marlon. Basically, their sources of income are: buying and selling of personal or home products and an E-loading business. She\u2019s been in the business for only four months and is striving her best to succeed in the industry, for it provides income for their day-to-day expenses. <br \/><br \/>The E-loading business is currently growing, since cellphones are being used by anyone, even kids at least seven years old already know how to use them, by means of communication or playing games using a smartphone. To start the E-loading business, you just need a phone, a retailer sim card and around PHP 500-1000 as a starting balance. Most of her customers are her neighbors and friends. <br \/><br \/>On the other hand, for the buy and sell business she signed up to become a member of a certain company, paying for a registration fee then selling their products. Once you sign up you are given a brochure, where you can show to customers all of the products that they offer. Customers select items on the brochure then the payment is on an installment basis. However, aside from brochures, she should have items on display as well, so that customers will not wait for weeks to have the items. Same on the E-loading business where there\u2019s an increase on market demand, the phone balance should always be sufficient or otherwise ample. <br \/><br \/>For the past four months, Mary Chiles has considered the businesses growing. To continue this, she decided to apply for a loan of PHP 10,000 as a supporting capital for her to buy necessities for her business. She is hoping that CCT will grant her request since this will be a great help for her to grow her businesses. <br \/><br \/>Despite being busy, Mary Chiles gives time in attending CCT group fellowship that consist of 10-15 individuals, where she can gain strength spiritually and where she hear testimonies from other CCT partners and is able to hear God\u2019s word, study the Word of God, build social relationship with other partners, and pay microfinance

He is 34 years old and a husband to Jeny. He is a new member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) and just signed up in March 2015. In running the business it\u2019s just them without any other employees. He is thankful that God blesses them by providing sufficient income for their day-to-day expenses.\r\n\r\nPerseverance and passion for the job are what made him stay in the business, since he has children that he needs to support and raise. The competition in this line of business is what he considered a challenge since it also affects their daily income. However, he is grateful for what God gave them including CCT, as he considers it God\u2019s extension of blessing to them.

The amount made a great impact since then; she\u2019s able to make any designs of clothing as she has the capability to buy materials that are essential.  Compared to before wen she only had limited materials it means the output that she produced was limited as well. She is thankful and she considered CCT as God\u2019s medium of blessing.<br \/><br \/>On the past six months, she considered the business growing. It means the increase of demand is present. Sonia decided to apply for another loan this year for Php 15,000 so that she will have stocks of different fabrics and other sewing materials.

For the past six months, she considered the business as growing. She\u2019s grateful that Center for Community Transformation (CCT) granted her previous loan request of PHP 12,000, and she considered it as God\u2019s blessing to her. The loan that was granted previously became a medium for her to buy a large quantity of vegetables to sell to consumers and provide a variety of options.<br \/><br \/>Since it is her bread and butter, Evangeline is persistently persevering to be successful in her chosen industry. Currently, she\u2019s just a tenant and dreams to invest in her own lot so that she will no longer pay for monthly rental.
