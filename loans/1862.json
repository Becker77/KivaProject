She has two elementary-school-aged children with her partner named Victor who has a school service for kids in their neighborhood. The couple help each other raise their children and provide for their daily needs.  \r\n\r\nJulieta has operated a party-needs store for almost eight years already. Her income from this business has helped cover their daily sustenance and the school needs of her children. Most Filipinos hold family and friends gatherings and special occasions at their homes or clubhouses. It is more economical than holding parties at restaurants. Her regular customers are her neighbors, relatives and the local community. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue and improve her services she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan to buy a tent, a \"videoke\" machine and other party needs like a table and balloons. Although most Filipinos live simple lives, special occasions like birthdays, wedding anniversaries, high school and college graduations, and family and school reunions are held close to their hearts. They will save as much as they can to celebrate these important events and milestones in their lives. \r\n\r\nJulieta aims to acquire her own vehicle to transport tables, chairs and a music machine to her customers. She wants her children to earn a college degree to allow them better opportunities in life.

In the comfort of your own home you can manage your own store. Filipinos prefer to buy items in a sari-sari store, since most are just located in neighborhoods, Baranggays and barrios, so you don't have to pay fairs going to cities just to buy items. Sari-sari is a Filipino word which means \u201cvariant,\u201d where items are cheaper since products are purchased on wholesale but are sold by piece, kilo or by volume to consumers. Candies, biscuits, seasonings, canned goods and such are sold by piece. Peanut butter, mayonnaise and other spreads are sold by volume while rice and animal feeds are measured by kilos.<br \/><br \/>Letezia, one of the members of Center for Community Transformation (CCT), is a housewife and a sari-sari store owner. She enjoys managing the store since she can take care of her family while running the business. Indeed, this became a medium for her to support her family\u2019s needs. However, she doesn't earn good profit in the business all the time. She still needs capital to buy additional products so that her store will become a one-stop-shop.

He is happily married to Minerva, a businesswoman, and has two children. The couple help each other to meet their family\u2019s daily personal and household needs and for the education of their high school child and elementary child. Mario, like many other Filipinos, puts education as a top priority on the budget, next to food.<br \/><br \/>Mario has recently opened a general store in their community. His small convenience store retails groceries, toiletries and beverages, piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Mario has a charming and friendly personality and people prefer to buy at his store. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.<br \/><br \/>To help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan that he will use to fill his store with grocery items such as sacks of rice, canned goods, noodles, beverages and toiletries. He is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given him.<br \/><br \/>Mario dreams to grow his mini store into a big grocery store. He wants to give his children the best education possible.

To support her family, she works as a daily wage labourer in addition to managing the household. Her family is dependent on agriculture for sustenance. She earns enough to manage the daily expenses at home but she spends a considerable amount of Rs 600 on medical expenses every month. She feels that building a toilet at home would drastically reduce that.<br \/><br \/>The sanitation crisis in India is a result of poor infrastructure and lack of education. Saroja leads a group of 3 living in Kulithalai that has understood the importance of having a toilet at home. But they do not have the means to build one. With no access to a toilet, their families have to walk long distances to answer nature's call in private: in dense bushes or isolated fields. Their women and girls, seeking privacy, often resort to waking up before sunrise to relieve themselves.

She retails food products that she purchases at weekly markets. This new loan will allow her to purchase one bag of sugar at 25000f and 20 litres of oil at 14000f for retail.

is from Kapan, where he lives with his wife.  Two years ago, he purchased a car using credit and started a taxi driving service in his town.  When he first earned income from the service, Hovhannes was able to improve his and his wife's living conditions.\r\n\r\nHe has now applied for this loan to pay for gas installation on the car and to make a final credit repayment on the car.  The gas installation will give Hovhannes an opportunity to decrease operational costs (gas is the cheapest fuel in Armenia) and to pay off the credit balance.\r\n \r\nHovhannes has been approved for a loan through a joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International.

At the comfort of your own home you can have your own store. Filipinos prefer to buy items in a Sari-sari store since most are just located in neighborhoods, Baranggays and barrios without spending fair going to cities just to buy items. Sari-sari is a Filipino word which means \u201cvariety\u201d where items are cheaper since products are purchase on wholesale but being sold by piece, kilos or by volume to consumers. Candies, biscuits, seasonings, canned goods and such are being sold by piece. Peanut butter, mayonnaise and other spreads are being sold by volume while rice and animal feeds, meat and chicken are measured by kilos.<br \/><br \/>Venus is a dedicated member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) since 2005, a housewife and a sari-sari store owner. She enjoys managing the store since she can take care of her family while doing the business. Indeed, this became a medium for their monetary needs. However, not all the time she earns good profit. She still needs capital to buy additional products so that her store will become a one-stop-shop.

grower. He is 40 years old and is married to \u00c1ngela Beatriz, He produces coffee under various different certification labels such as: Fairtrade and Rainforest. He sells his coffee through COCAFCAL. Luis Fernando has been producing coffee for over 20 years and has been working with certification labels for 5 years.  <br \/><br \/>Luis Fernando has two dependent children and he believes that leaving them an inheritance is not enough, \"leaving them a healthy planet is the best and most important legacy\". He says that his greatest dream is that his children will be able to enjoy the goodness of the earth and that through it they will have the best opportunities, and be well prepared to make the most of them. <br \/><br \/>Producing organic coffee has become very popular right now in his region and such practices improve the quality of coffee. This makes it possible to get a better price for harvested crops as well as making farms more sustainable and environmentally friendly. This is why Luis Fernando has chosen to convert his farm to organic production. As pests have damaged his plantation, he has taken the opportunity to replant and undertake a certification process for his brand new plants.<br \/><br \/>Luis Fernando is requesting a loan to carry out the required work for gaining certification and to put new coffee plants in his plantation. With the profit from his coffee he hopes to have enough income to give his children a quality education. A loan would help Luis Fernando to start growing his coffee crop in line with environmentally friendly practices and it would also give him extra income to improve his family's quality of life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1948484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy the materials he needs to make his coffee plantation organic such as: organic fertiliser, coffee plants and other organic consumables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Capucas, San Pedro Cop\u00e1n, Honduras","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":448,"posted_date":"2015-08-13T16:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-12T16:00:04Z","loan_amount":3650,"lender_count":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":73,"loan_amount":3650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2018-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":15790},{"due_date":"2019-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18316.4},{"due_date":"2020-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":21247.02},{"due_date":"2021-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":24646.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":720.42},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":835.69},{"due_date":"2020-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":969.39},{"due_date":"2021-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1124.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-19T16:17:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Reece","image":null}},{"id":931073,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virginia works hard to support her family.

from the town of Tursun-zoda. She is 34 years old and she is married. Hiloloy is the mother of three wonderful children. Her husband is a laborer. Hiloloy has had a great interest in tailoring since childhood. She has taken courses in cutting and sewing, and started embroidering and taking orders at home. She has gained confidence in her work and become one of the best seamstresses in her town. Despite fulfilling all her orders on her old sewing machine, she sews very beautifully and neatly. But now her sewing machine is not in a condition to sew well and so Hiloloy has applied for a loan to buy a new sewing machine with computer modelling. She is really relying on your help."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":109.28,"image":{"id":1952488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a new sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursun-zoda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-08-13T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-12T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hiloloy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":324.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":358.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":366.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":383.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":384.57},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":414.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":427.86},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":431.36},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":456.45},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":469.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":483.9},{"due_date":"2016-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":499.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.53},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.46},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.02},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.03},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.2},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.42},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51.9,"local_amount":324.38,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":324.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731042259},{"amount":57.38,"local_amount":358.6,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":359.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752131214}],"funded_date":"2015-09-09T18:33:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":931171,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is 30 years old.

She has deeply appreciated the processes that happened before she can touch these products. She can compare it to her changed life. Now, she has the capacity to help others by employing them in her pottery shop located in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental. She has two workers who create earthenware products. There are various shapes of pots, jars, vases, and vessels which are attractive to both local and visiting buyers. \r\n\r\nEraly\u2019s business partner is her husband, Alex, and their inspiration are their five children. They work diligently to provide for their needs and education. \r\n\r\nNow she desires to have a loan assistance of PhP 40,000 to buy a volume of raw materials such as clay, wood, and various patterns for her pottery. She will also use part of the loan to pay her workers. Payment for volume pottery orders from her shop comes late at times, and she needs to adjust so her workers\u2019 salary won\u2019t be affected.\r\n\r\nEraly is a devoted member of CCT Credit Cooperative and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

I am 18 years old and live in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, where I was born and raised. I have no children and I am single. I live with my mother and two little sisters (8 and 12 years old). My mother has no job and now we live on the alimony she receives monthly from the father of my sisters; we have no contact with my father.<br \/><br \/>\u201cI started studying mechanical engineering at the technical university of Santo Domingo (INTEC), where I completed three quarters of the course and then had to withdraw for financial reasons. During my time at university, the subjects that I liked were: introduction to engineering and integral calculus, because I will depend a lot on both when I become a professional; plus I learned many new things. I would like to finish my studies at the same university because I know that it is one of the best in the country and it offers me the necessary resources to perform and be well prepared for the future.<br \/><br \/>\u201cThis loan is absolutely essential for me to finish my degree and achieve my dreams. Without it, I will have to leave university. If I receive the loan my life would change dramatically, because aside from having a greater motivation to be a great person in the future, I know that many doors will be open to me when I finish my degree. In addition, I will likewise encourage underprivileged young people like me to study regardless of their economic status, because thanks to loans that would no longer be a barrier.<br \/><br \/>After graduating from this degree, I plan to do post-graduate studies and then another degree. Then I will continue to study continuously. My ultimate goal in life is to keep studying, in order to guarantee a decent and carefree life for my family, and also to be sufficiently prepared to get a good, steady job. I would like to have a job where I can practise my profession, such optimizing the production processes of a company or industry, or ensuring quality control of products used daily in

That would help him learn at a higher level, which would benefit him and his family. He wants to work doing what he likes, which is building, and helping to improve the profession. When he finishes his studies at SENATI, he would like to specialize in the field of Mechanical Engineering. He is already working hard towards this, and is one of the top students in his class. He studies between 40 and 45 hours per week.<br \/><br \/>He is currently only in his second semester of school, so he still has two years left before he can finish. But because of the difficult financial situation his family is going through, he is worried that he won't be able to achieve his goals, so he has come to Kiva in order to pay for school. When he finishes, he will start working in order to pay his way through the next phase of his education. He wants to become a successful professional, and counting himself among the best engineers in order to help improve society would make him very happy.<br \/><br \/>The only problems he faces are financial, because his chosen path is one of the most expensive, but it is also one of the professions for which demand is highest.<br \/><br \/>Receiving support from Kiva makes him feel good knowing that there are people who want to help those in need.

His mother has a small juice shop that helps her family get ahead. During vacation time Wilfredo helps his mother, preparing juices and waiting on the customers.<br \/><br \/>Wilfredo chose to study Textile Chemistry because he likes chemistry and colors a lot. It is also one of the fields with high labor demand in his country. He is currently in his third semester, which means he has a year and a half to go before he finishes his studies. He is doing well in his classes and is very happy, which is why he doesn't want to stop studying, and therefore asks the Kiva community's help so that he can finish his studies in the aforementioned time period.<br \/><br \/>When he finishes with his education he would like to work in a company call Sudamericana de Fibras [South American Fibers]. He wants to make the most out of his knowledge, acquire more experience,  then go independent and start his own business, and by doing so, be able to share what he has learned for society's benefit. In doing this, he will get his family ahead, as they have sacrificed so much so that he can continue with his studies.<br \/><br \/>The reason why Wilfredo is turning to Kiva is because his mother can no longer pay the monthly tuition fees. A loan would help him economically a great deal, and ensure that he continues studying, which would mean so much for him as he would have the confidence he needs to continue fighting for his dreams.<br \/><br \/>Being qualified for this loan, Wilfred is very happy because he will be able to excel in his studies, be a successful person, make his family proud, and be a great example for his younger brothers, which is his biggest dream in life.<br \/><br \/>Wilfred would like to say the following: \"I feel very happy knowing that there are institutions such as Kiva that bet on the professional development of students.

She started her own business with a small capital in order to support her family expenses. Her husband drives an auto-rickshaw and his income was not enough to maintain the family expenses.\r\n\r\nHer monthly income was only 4,800 INR per month. She now sees scope to expand her business and contribute more towards the household financially. Thus, she has come forward to apply for a loan. She will sell clothes like t-shirts, jeans, pants, shawls, etc. She expects her income to increase by 2,700 INR. \r\n\r\nDevarani leads a group of six women.

She tries all possible ways to enhance her business because it supplies the resources to meet her daily needs. It\u2019s just good that her grown-up children are no longer dependent on her. Yet, she still desires to earn money herself since she understands that her children are starting their own families too. \r\n\r\nShe applied for PHP 29,000 in supplementary capital that she will use partly to buy sacks of rice, grocery items and beverages for her store. She would like to set aside some amount as seed money to build extension rooms that she can rent out as a boarding house.

Narine will be very thankful to lenders for their support, because this loan is very important for her business to develop further."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":49.11,"image":{"id":1953859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to pay for new stock (fabric paintings, fibers, jewelry) to make different carpets, and tablecloths to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Noyemberyan town","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2015-08-14T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-13T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10994.7},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":11612.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":11983.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":12098.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":12175.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":12457.4},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":12680.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":12764.2},{"due_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":13044.4},{"due_date":"2016-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":13191.3},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":13393},{"due_date":"2016-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":13604.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.21},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.47},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.26},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.02},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.82,"local_amount":10994.7,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-24T12:11:26Z","rounded_local_amount":11400.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731163069},{"amount":25.29,"local_amount":11673.6,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":12104.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752250862}],"funded_date":"2015-08-14T04:03:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}}]}
