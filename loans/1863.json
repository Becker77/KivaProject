Over the years, he has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in his village. He has been practicing mixed farming. His primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, tea, crops, and some small business ventures that help him make ends meet. David is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating his farm. That is why, every day, he wakes up very early to go to his farm to plough. <br \/><br \/>Although he makes profits from farming, he is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase his income by buying seeds so that he can plant them and sell them after harvesting. That is why he is seeking this loan to buy seeds. Kenya's Nkubu area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for food. This means that David could increase his profits and satisfy the demand that is there. <br \/><br \/>Accessing funds has been a challenge for David, but he now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring men farmers like him turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. David believes that this loan will be of much help, and that he will be able to satisfy the demand for food. <br \/><br \/>He also believes that the extra income he earns will enable permanent change in his life and increase his business.

Many say it is a magical town as it is full of unique art, painted murals and friendly people. It is a peaceful and well-organized town that draws tourists from all over the world.<br \/> <br \/>Seven women have organized themselves into the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cDel Carmen\u201d. The ladies are happy to report that because of their previous loans generously funded by Kiva investors, they have increased their earnings and expanded their businesses.They are requesting their 3rd loan from Kiva investors.  <br \/> <br \/>Rebeca is the Secretary of the Trust Bank who has a shop near the Lake where she sells beautiful scarves, shawls, ponchos, makeup bags, purses, hammocks, and bedspreads. Many of the textiles are dyed using natural dyes, a specialty of the town. She says that during the three loan cycles, she has realized great benefits being a member of the Trust Bank. <br \/><br \/>Rebeca recalls that at the beginning of her relationship with Friendship Bridge, her inventory was very small and it has grown considerably. She is very pleased. With the new loan that she is requesting, Rebeca would like to purchase 200 pounds of thread and yarn in various textures and colors.<br \/><br \/>Rebeca has two children and is keenly aware of the value of education for them. Fortunately, the Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge combines education and small loans and so Rebeca and her friends in the Trust Bank have an opportunity to educate themselves. Each month, a Friendship Bridge Facilitator shares useful information with the ladies using drawings, role playing and games. The women gain valuable business tools as they learn about effective business practices like budgeting, pricing, accounting and customer service. They also learn about women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, violence against women, as well as how to set goals and dreams.

She requires a loan in order to buy more packets of cereal, expression hair weavon, cartons of paste cream, soap, hair oil and hair spray. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 500,000 SLL. <br \/><br \/>Monjama was unable to meet her plans because of the current crisis in the country, that the movement of people from one place to another is restricted.  In the future, Monjama still plans to open a boutique and to import goods of different types for wholesale. She is very hard working and she thanks you for your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1739187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy more packets of cereal, nutria, expression hair, cartons of paste cream, soap, hair oil and hair spray.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Freetown East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2015-08-14T16:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-13T16:50:17Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.11,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monjama J","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1012500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730931238},{"amount":123.89,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":506250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.11,"payment_id":752023216}],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T21:59:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":931576,"name":"Conchita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Conchita is a married woman with six children.

It helps him greatly to have a good production and makes him some earnings, enabling him to buy some work tools.<br \/><br \/>In this community there is no electricity, and so Roberto is requesting a loan to buy a solar panel, which will light his recently-made home. It will produce light with energy rather than candles, as he currently has. <br \/><br \/>Roberto would be very thankful for the opportunity granted by this loan for the solar power system."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1950601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to install a 100-watt solar panel with 5 lights.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":279,"posted_date":"2015-08-14T22:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-13T22:20:07Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":288.28,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":131.04},{"due_date":"2017-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":157.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.37},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-17T16:01:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Eisenberg","image":null}},{"id":925911,"name":"Veronicah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Veronicah has finished paying her previous loan.

Since he started the training he has been keen to start a business in rearing chicken.  He got a place to establish the chicken run at the school which will enable him to start his chicken rearing project. \r\n\r\nIt costs KES 22,000 to build a chicken run which can accommodate 100 chicks. It will cost KES 58,000 for the feed and vaccines for one year. The chickens will start laying eggs from week 19 up to week 84, giving a total of 65 weeks with an average of 45 eggs per day. \r\n\r\nHe will start with 50 chicks which will produce 20,475 eggs over a period of 65 weeks, amounting to 682 crates. One crate sells for KES320. This will generate a gross profit margin of KES138,240. He is looking forward to continually adding more chicks to the full capacity of the chicken run. \r\n\r\nHe will also sell other products from the project which includes manure and the chickens after they are past their laying age of two years. A loan of KES80,000 will enable Patrick to buy 50 chicks and feed."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":33.41,"image":{"id":1954649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to purchase chicks and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Githurai","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":262,"posted_date":"2015-08-14T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-13T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3341},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2016-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2016-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2016-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2016-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2016-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2017-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2017-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2017-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2017-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2017-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2017-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2017-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.41},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.41,"local_amount":3341,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3381.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752115361}],"funded_date":"2015-08-18T22:47:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Margaret Rosen","image":null}},{"id":931766,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph is a married man.

The land provides corn, rice, beans, cassava or sweet potato while livestock provide milk, meat and other products.\r\n\r\nThe group's name was chosen as, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, if they suffer a setback they will rise again with greater force. They are: Miriam who is earns a living in tailoring; Claudia, jewellery; Zenaida, sewing, food and health food products; Irma, cosmetics; Mary C., decorative items; Maria L., groceries; Maria G., shoes; Minerva, a garage while Mary J., Victoria and Eduvigez run a beautician's.\r\n\r\nMiriam has a strong character, clear objectives and is a single mother with a young girl and a teenager; \"for my children I decided to become self-employed in order to provide them with the best as I am their father and mother,\" she says.\r\n\r\nFor 17 years she has been earning a living as a seamstress. She began at the age of 15 mending trousers for her neighbours by attaching zips or taking up hems. Also, she remembers with joy being a child and taking her father's clothes, scissors and needles and making clothes for her dolls. Later her mother taught her the correct technique and when she was older she trained in order to be a dressmaker. \r\n\r\nShe also works on weekends helping her parents in the preparation of barbecue beef, chicken or pork which are traditional dishes in their community. The profits made help cover the household expenses and the education of their children.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a loan in order to buy fabric, bias binding, pins, buttons, zips, needles and thread in order to begin making school uniforms for the next school year. \"Thanks for every loan granted as, like the phoenix, we succeed in reinvigorating our activities and increasing our productivity\". With these words Miriam gives thanks for the confidence and support of VFM\u00e9xico.\r\n\r\n* The photograph was taken outside the home of Miriam who is wearing a green blouse and beige pants. The children in the picture are the children of Eduvigez.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":1945950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced.
