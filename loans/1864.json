In addition to doing the household chores and taking care of her baby, she spends time in her tailoring shop to cater to the demands in her village. \r\n\r\nHer current income is not enough for her to make ends meet. Hence she decided to expand her business to bring in more income. To upgrade her tailoring business, she needed an extra sewing machine. But, due to lack of working capital, she could not afford one. Therefore she has applied for a loan with the group of six women that she leads. \r\n\r\nMira, Purnima, Mousumi, Tanushree, Minu and Leena need a loan of Rs. 90,000.

Therefore, she comes to Kiva to address this issue. <br \/><br \/>She wants humbly to borrow a loan worth PHP 15,000 that she will use in buying more merchandise to offer to her customers.

Currently, she gets the animals in her municipality and once they are grown, she sells them to her neighbors or people even come to buy them from other communities. The key for this activity to prosper is that in reality she loves what she does and treats her customers warmly. Up to now, her business has given the expected results, especially with the sale of chickens and sheep. The loan that she is requesting will help her purchase more chickens and feed since her only goal is to expand her production so to continue supporting her son who is a student. <br \/><br \/>The members of the group are Monica, Ma del Carmen, Hugo and Faustino who will invest in pigs, Laura and Angel in lambs, Gustavo in calves, Marco Antonio and Gabriela in chickens. <br \/><br \/>*The photo was taken with the chickens.

Now, they have five employees with them helping to maintain their inventory. This is a milestone for them, since this business supports their family by providing for their daily living expenses. <br \/><br \/>Today, Pedro wants to further enhance this business through a loan from Kiva worth PHP 15,000. He will utilize this to buy additional equipment to make furniture and to purchase other materials needed. This will surely help Pedro to be more efficient. <br \/><br \/>Dedicated to success, Pedro assures you that he will view your help as a blessing and will work even harder to faithfully repay your goodness and generosity. <br \/><br \/>He meets weekly with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God he studies. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has been running this business for over six years and she knows that this can still expand or grow if she only has enough business capital. With the fact that her items are highly in demand right now, since one can cook instantly, there is a great possibility that Zenaida can widen her trade. <br \/><br \/>Now, Zenaida wants to acquire a loan from Kiva to buy more merchandise such as frozen products and other items to sell. It is because she usually runs out of stock due to financial issues. In order to continually satisfy the demand of her \u201csuki\u201ds or regular customers, she comes to Kiva through CCT, a group of ministries in the Philippines, for a PHP 15,000 loan.

It\u2019s difficult, especially when you did not attend a higher level of education, and worse if you are not able to go to school at all. In general, for this reason, many people try to look for other ways of generating income apart from employment. <br \/><br \/>Norma was one of these kinds of people. In order to face this challenging world, she found a house-rental business to address her problem. She offers her apartments for lodging to families and individuals in exchange for a monthly charge, basically depending on how large the room is. Basically her earnings from this inventory go as support for her nephew's and niece\u2019s educational needs. <br \/><br \/>If you\u2019d allow, she wants to borrow a loan of PHP 15,000 that she will use to renovate and beautify her apartments.

The inhabitants still conserve their traditions, among these their celebrations, clothing, and mother tongue.\r\n\r\nMarcela is 42 years old and married to Rafael. Together they have formed a family with three children, all of whom are presently studying. 'Dona Marce', as she is affectionately known, is a very hard-working woman who is involved in three distinct activities: selling economy meals, selling groceries, and selling clothing. The latter was the activity that launched her into the world of commerce. She began this thanks to her mother who, some 15 years ago, gave her some clothing to sell in order to have her own income. \u201cI wanted to initiate another activity to augment my earnings a bit and, thus, to help with household expenses,\u201d Marce says. That's how she got into selling groceries from small stalls in public markets near her community. Later, she also began to sell sandwiches, tacos and buns ... \u201cbut my customers like the flavor and that motivated me to open an economy kitchen\u201d. \r\n\r\nEvery day Marce opens her economy kitchen, which is tended by her employees, while she spends more and more time at the other businesses she established, while facing competition from other economy kitchens. \u201cI think mine is different from the others because of the good flavor and the fruit drinks I always offer,\u201d comments Marce with conviction. The new loan will be invested in her little grocery stall; she will purchase dry seeds, cereals, and cooking oils.\r\n\r\nMarce's grand dream is to continue progressing with her businesses and to open another economy kitchen. According to her plans, she will delegate her other activities in order to dedicate herself full time to producing the meals that she likes best. Concerning her family, she comments: \u201cI would like to see my children prepared professionally; I would not want them to dedicate themselves to commerce because it is very hard work.\u201d \r\n\r\n*The photo was taken at her grocery stand which Marce opens every Monday in a public market.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":821.6,"image":{"id":1947461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"purchase dry seeds, cereals, cooking oils, etc., to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santa Cruz Mextepec, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-08-15T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-14T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1727.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1767.47},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1808.71},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1850.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1894.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1938.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1983.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2029.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.76},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.62},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":335.94,"local_amount":5304.37,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5433.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701381},{"amount":237.23,"local_amount":3745.73,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3836.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204471},{"amount":248.43,"local_amount":3922.57,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4018.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291892}],"funded_date":"2015-08-15T19:08:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":932070,"name":"Annabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"One line from a Filipino song goes like this, \u201cWalang imposible.

One of them is Lilibeth and she\u2019s very grateful since CCT approved the loan of PHP 41,000 that she applied for last year, an added capital that helped her buy on demand and high quality appliances. This amount made a great impact on the business since it allowed customers to choose a wide range of designs and efficient items. Lilibeth chose this business since being a housewife, she\u2019ll be able to take care of her family and manage the business at the same time, because most of her customers are her neighbors and living in their barangay or village. Sometimes Rufo, Lilibeth\u2019s husband helps with the business every time there\u2019s no work for sink, drain and pump repairs.<br \/><br \/>Lilibeth aims to expand the business and attract new customers as well not just in their village but also in other locations since this became a way to support her children\u2019s education and daily needs. However, there are challenges that can\u2019t be avoided. Buyers who are not paying for the products on time cause a delay in return of investment. With this, Lilibeth decided to apply for another loan of PHP 50,000 this year as added capital for buy on demand appliances such as: flat screen televisions. electric fans, washing machines, electric stoves, amplifiers, etc. The quality and reliability should be considered as well. <br \/><br \/>Being a long time member of CCT, Lilibeth has been consistently attending her CCT fellowship group that consists of 15 to 30 members, where she hears the word of God and testimonies from partners.

Raising pigs has been the main business for her for 19 years. In addition, she sometimes works as a paid worker for supplemental income. These two businesses earn her about 30,900 KHR per day to sustain the family\u2019s living. The challenge to her pig-raising business is her pigs got ill and grew slowly. <br \/><br \/>This is the second time for Saroeurng with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) and the past loan was paid back completely.

Among them there exists a great confidence that has allowed them to advance their loan group. The place where they grew up is characterized by having all the basic services, in contrast to other nearby communities.\r\n\r\nEugenia is a very happy and friendly woman. She is 37 years old and is married to Jos\u00e9. Together they have formed a family with three children; two of them are in primary school and the youngest is about to enter preschool.\r\n\r\nKena, as she [Eugenia] is known to her friends, began her little sewing workshop six years ago. Everything began because she worked in a textile factory for three years, where she acquired sufficient experience to feel confident and decide to set up her own business. The workshop is located in her house, where she does alterations or makes special items of clothing that her customers request. Kena remembers that she bought her first sewing machine with her own savings. With the passing of time, she managed to buy another machine thanks to the support of VFMexico, which for four years has been her source of financing. With the new loan, she will buy basic supplies to continue her work, such as fabric, needles, thread, closures, and elastic, among other items. Kena always does whatever is possible to take maximum advantage of her loan, making a good investment, since she seeks the best prices.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to make her business grow in order to continue supporting her children in their education. \"I would like them to be able to complete professional courses of study in order to have a better quality of life,\" comments Kena.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Sara, who will invest in sheep; Veronica, [who will invest] in rabbits; and Maria de los Angeles,  [who will invest] in chickens and tortillas.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken in Kena's workshop. She is the one wearing glasses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2464.18,"image":{"id":1944031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, needles, thread, closures, ribbons, and elastic, among other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Dolores Hidalgo, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-08-15T21:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-14T21:00:01Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":46000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5129.51},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5461.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":5582.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5706.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.03},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5962.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":6094.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6229.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345.89},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":361.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":369.41},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":377.59},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1002.15,"local_amount":16174.99,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":16208.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701384},{"amount":714.99,"local_amount":11540.26,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:26Z","rounded_local_amount":11564.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204476},{"amount":747.04,"local_amount":12057.55,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":12082.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291897}],"funded_date":"2015-08-17T14:56:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":932183,"name":"Callen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Callen, 46 years old, is married and supports five school children.

The members are proud to belong to a community with indigenous roots, which is also located very close to the head of the municipality.  This makes it easier to deal with any government paperwork or for their children to go to the best schools in the area.<br \/><br \/>Mar\u00eda del Carmen  is a very hard-working woman who is responsible about her obligations.  She is a 49 year old widow, and she has no financial dependents.  She has been selling Mexican dishes for ten years.  She started this business activity out of her great culinary enjoyment.  \"I love to cook all types of food; Spanish, Mexican, and Chinese.  Here the Mexican dishes sell much better.\"  <br \/><br \/>The biggest difficulty that Carmen, as she is best known, had was that in the beginning she had no stable place to sell the food.  \"Now I have a place in front of the government palace where I put my small mobile stand.\"<br \/><br \/>Carmen's schedule is from three in the afternoon until midnight in order to take maximum advantage of the time.  Carmen says that staying up late is a little hard, but she really likes the contact with her customers.<br \/><br \/>Her goal is to continue with her business, which makes her feel proud and also helps her feel independent.<br \/><br \/>She will use the loan to buy more supplies like gas, vegetables, meat, juices, and soft drinks, etc.<br \/><br \/>All of the members are very grateful for the new investment, which will be a big help.  Jos\u00e9 will buy linens (sheets, quilts, and towels); Saturina household items; Lidia pigs, Mar\u00eda Felisa calves; Erika clothes; Ofelia and Jessica sheep.  <br \/><br \/>*The photo was taken at the place where the group meets.

como pollos, pavos, patos, cerdos y borregos; recientemente ha solicitado un cr\u00e9dito para comprar 4 cerdos m\u00e1s y l\u00e1minas para remodelar el corral donde los conserva ya que la temporada de lluvias ha comenzado y necesita mantener a los animales en las mejores condiciones. \n\nElla decidi\u00f3 iniciar esta actividad ya que es una costumbre en la comunidad donde vive, adem\u00e1s porque necesitaba hallar la manera de sacar adelante a sus hijos. Adela aprendi\u00f3 la actividad gracias a su madre, lo que la hace muy preciada ya que tambi\u00e9n obtiene ingresos y de cierta forma ayuda a la comunidad al vender animales de mejor calidad ya que son cuidados en casa. Unos de los retos m\u00e1s grandes que presenta do\u00f1a Adela es cuando los animales enferman por lo que siempre necesita invertir parte de sus ganancias en vitaminas y veterinarios. Con las ganancias, Adela tambi\u00e9n logr\u00f3 comenzar a vender dulces y botanas. Las ganancias de esta actividad las invierte completamente en la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. Por si fuera poco VFM\u00e9xico la apoy\u00f3 para tener un huerto familiar y ha comenzado a vender algunas verduras en la comunidad.\n\nLa meta de Adela es que todos sus hijos terminen de estudiar una carrera profesional que adem\u00e1s puedan ejercer. Recientemente su hijo Jos\u00e9 Luis termin\u00f3 su Licenciatura en Educaci\u00f3n logro que tambi\u00e9n atribuye al apoyo de los cr\u00e9ditos de VFM\u00e9xico que le permitieron continuar con su actividad. \"Gracias a los pr\u00e9stamos ahora tengo mis animales, mi puesto de botanas y el huerto que me otorgo la instituci\u00f3n\".\n\nLas dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Maria Maura, Agripina y Ang\u00e9lica quienes invierten en pollos y pavos; por su parte Ma Lourdes, Maria Teresa y Adriana, en cerdos; Magdalena, en herrer\u00eda y Elma Edith, en borregos.\n\n *La fotografia fue tomada en las escaleras del kiosco del municipio, Adela es quien viste el su\u00e9ter morado y est\u00e1 ubicaada en la parte superior.","en":"Adela is a very happy and hard-working person. She is 52 years old and a single mother of three children, of which only one depends on her and is in secondary school. <br \/><br \/>Adela has worked raising animals such as chickens, turkeys, ducks, pigs and lambs for 25 years. She has recently asked for a loan to buy 4 more pigs and metal sheets to remodel the farmyard, because the rainy season has begun and she needs to keep her animals in the best condition. <br \/><br \/>She decided to start this job because it is custom in the community that she lives in, as well as because she needed to find a way to support her children. She learned the work thanks to her mother, making her very precious because she also receives earnings and in a way she helps the community to sell better quality animals because they are cared for at home. One of the biggest challenges that Adela has is when the animals get sick and she has to invest part of her earnings into vitamins and veterinarians. With the earnings, Adela also managed to begin to sell sweets and snacks. She invests the earnings from this work completely into her children's education.

There are five women who are from there and whose characteristic seal is that they conserve the traditions and native language between them. <br \/><br \/>Mar\u00eda Luisa was convinced the moment she started a family that she also needed to have a job to bring income into her home. Raising animals looked like the best option to achieve her goal because, adding to her earnings, she had the time she needed to look after her children. At the beginning, she did not have a duly established farmyard and only raised a few animals. Now she has a well-cemented farmyard and a greater production, thanks to the support of VFM\u00e9xico in a large degree. <br \/><br \/>\"The loan has helped me improve my business and contribute to paying the household expenses,\" says a happy Mar\u00eda Luisa. <br \/><br \/>With the new loan opportunity, she can buy three small lambs, which are the best-selling animals in the community, especially to the people who make a living making traditional Mexican barbacoa. The goal that she has in mind is to increase her clientele to receive better earnings and be able to save for her retirement. However, she has no plans to retire soon because work is the only way to feel alive, as she says.  <br \/><br \/>Other members of the group are Yolanda, Maria Luisa C, Maribel and Maria Manuela, who will invest into lambs. <br \/><br \/>*The photo was taken in front of the town church.

This is Robert. He is the head teacher of Splendor Education Services, a mixed school in the urban area of Kisasi in Kampala with 115 students. Splendor School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water-filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water-filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water-treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Splendor School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Robert ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from waterborne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1955603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water-filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-08-16T00:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-15T00:50:08Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Splendor School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3035000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":620369.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755507284}],"funded_date":"2015-08-16T20:39:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":932263,"name":"Rosita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosita has been engaged in fish selling for 23 years.

For the above, with the amount she has applied for, she will buy the necessary materials such as cement, bricks, sand, and gravel and also pay for labor."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":137.9,"image":{"id":1951544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to buy cement, bricks, sand, and gravel and also to pay for labor to construct a bathroom and a washing and water storage area to store water for her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2015-08-16T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-15T01:40:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roxana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":26.71},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":27.73},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":29.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":29.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":31.41},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":32.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":33.51},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":35.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":36.13},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":37.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":38.94},{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":41.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.71},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.73},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.91},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.41},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.28},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.51},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.25},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.13},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.65},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.94},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.71,"local_amount":26.71,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":26.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711400136},{"amount":111.19,"local_amount":111.19,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":111.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730921294}],"funded_date":"2015-08-17T03:04:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":929965,"name":"Ana Emperatriz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana de 69 a\u00f1os es una empresaria independiente que cuenta con una amplia experiencia en la comercializaci\u00f3n de mercanc\u00edas varias entre ellas art\u00edculos para el hogar, prendas de vestir, calzado y productos para el aseo personal.

Zacar\u00edas necesita aprovechar la \u00e9poca del nuevo ciclo escolar y confeccionar\u00e1 los uniformes para los ni\u00f1os, afortunadamente ya tiene varios pedidos.\n\nEste joven emprendedor explica que aprendi\u00f3 la actividad con tan s\u00f3lo ver, recuerda que hace apenas dos a\u00f1os ni siquiera la contemplaba para dedicarse a ella. Sin embargo, las personas de la comunidad lo animaban a aprender el negocio, legado de su familia.\n\nEl sue\u00f1o de Zacar\u00edas es hacer crecer su taller de costura para tambi\u00e9n dar empleo a otras personas de su comunidad.\nLos integrantes del grupo son Rodolfo quien tiene un taller de costura; Eva \u00c1ngeles, quien vende accesorios para autos y Blanca Estela, quien cr\u00eda pavos y pollos.\n\n","en":"The A.M. Group is a new small association. This is the first time that they request a loan from VFMexico, which makes them a bit nervous, as they have not received loans from anywhere else. They also feel excited, since the borrowed money represents an opportunity to help their businesses grow.\r\n\r\nThe members of the association live in a small community in the Mazahua region, where the majority of the population works making handcrafts such as hats, scarfs and gloves, among others. \r\n\r\nZacarias is a very nice man who is known for his good humor. He is 24 years old and single. A year ago, he started a small sewing workshop, which is his family's traditional occupation. The workshop is located in his house, where he installed the sewing machines. \"Even though I don't have a lot of time in the business, I already have very good customers. This loan will help me buy materials such as fabric, zippers, thread and needles.\" Zacarias needs to take advantage of the new school cycle to make uniforms for the children -- luckily he already has some orders.\r\n\r\nThis young entrepreneur explains that he learned this activity just by watching others. He comments that even two years ago he was not even contemplating going into this field. However, people in the community encouraged him to learn this occupation, which is his family's tradition.\r\n\r\nZacarias' dream is to grow his sewing workshop to also provide employment to others in the community. \r\n\r\nThe association's members are: Rodolfo, who has a sewing workshop; Eva Angeles, who sells car accessories; and Blanca Estela, who grows turkeys and chickens. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":837.5,"image":{"id":1946717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machine Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials such as fabric, zippers, thread and needles.

Those who are selling household products go outside their peaceful Mazahua community to other states of the republic to increase their income.<br \/><br \/>The Bugambilia group was organized by six cheerful, enthusiastic women who earn a living selling various products.  Feliza, Florina and Alicia will buy novelty items,  while Laura,  Araceli and Maria de Lourdes will invest in blender containers. <br \/><br \/> Laura is very young but despite her youth has great hopes in life.  She is very friendly and talkative.  Laura is 21 years old and married to Gustavo.  Together they have formed a family with two children who are too young for school.  <br \/><br \/> Five years ago, Laura and her husband began their business of selling blender containers.  The parents of both work in sales, so that they decided to follow in their footsteps.  \"Early in the day we travel to the plazas, markets and bazaars to start the day; sometimes we are near our home and other times we must travel farther to gain more income.\"  The new loan will allow them to buy more containers and continue their work.  <br \/><br \/>Laura  talks about their not having a fixed place for sales; they even walk the streets to offer their merchandise, but she does like this way of working since it lets them go where their customers are.   <br \/><br \/>What's really difficult is the weather since when it rains, continuing to sell and get a profit for the day becomes almost impossible.

Just to mention one of them, she doesn\u2019t have a formal job. But her courage, perseverance, and desire to succeed make her get up every day to work on her poultry business. <br \/><br \/>She has been practicing mixed farming for the last thirteen years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling eggs and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in other small personal business. <br \/><br \/>The Chuka area is very populated, and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. <br \/><br \/>She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. <br \/><br \/>Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets, and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":66.18,"image":{"id":1941532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-16T08:10:38Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-15T08:10:38Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucyline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.94,"local_amount":4293.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4349.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731023997},{"amount":23.24,"local_amount":2323.86,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2354.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112127}],"funded_date":"2015-08-25T17:02:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":928878,"name":"Yacine's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe de 3 membres fait partie du banc villageois qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9e le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2009.

Cristina is a very enterprising woman who always gets ahead. She has had a small store of basic products for the past ten years, where she sells products such as sweet breads, eggs, vegetables, dairy products, and more.

With this investment, she expects that her sales will increase and, with that, she will get closer to her goal of having her own retail space and offer her minor children, who she has completely in her care as a single mother, a better well-being."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":133.14,"image":{"id":1951776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to purchase an industrial stove and groceries such as rice, meat, oil, and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-08-16T11:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-15T11:50:04Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladis Johana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":122126},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":131790},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135743},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":139816},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":144010},{"due_date":"2016-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":148331},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":152780},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":157364},{"due_date":"2016-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162085},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166947},{"due_date":"2016-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171956},{"due_date":"2016-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":177114},{"due_date":"2016-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":182428},{"due_date":"2016-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":187901},{"due_date":"2016-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":193538},{"due_date":"2016-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":199344},{"due_date":"2016-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":205324},{"due_date":"2017-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":221403}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.73},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.03},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.68},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.2},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.77},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.38},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.75},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.51},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.33},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.2},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.12},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.11},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.15},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.76,"local_amount":253916,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":254920.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730994703},{"amount":46.38,"local_amount":135743,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":136280.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752082656}],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T23:54:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Wendy Harris","image":null}},{"id":932095,"name":"Esmeralda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of nine children, Esmeralda works hard to support her family.

She runs her business in a well-known market, located in the northern part of the city, which is known for its many offerings such as: beauty salons, clothes, shoes, purses and accessories, jewelry, flowers, gifts, groceries, dairy products and cold cuts, meat products, household appliances, cell phones, food, snacks, etc. The warm, sub tropical climate of the area has varied temperatures throughout the day between 21 \u2013 35 degrees Celsius. <br \/><br \/>Deysi has an olive-skinned complexion, brown eyes, long brown hair, is short, thin, and her mother tongue is Guarani which is spoken in the area. Because of the general culture and to run her business, she also speaks Spanish. (She is the woman, third from the right, wearing a blue blouse and light blue pants, with a brown purse). She lives with her partner who works as a driver and her children; the two oldest children study in school and the youngest is currently in kindergarten. They live in a rented room built of bricks and cement with a metal roof and cement floor. Their home has electricity, potable water, and plumbing. <br \/><br \/>Her desire to improve, due to the necessity of paying the academic expenses of her children, led her to join the community bank of people with businesses such as: sale of secondhand clothes, a key-making workshop, sale of bags and purses, peanut sales, sale of natural health products, plaster handcrafts, meat sales, sale of jewelry, and sale of dairy products, in order to ask for a loan and improve their businesses.<br \/><br \/>Her business is selling traditional foods such as: rice with cheese (rice, milk, and cheese), \u201cmajao\u201d (ground jerky, boiled plantains, and rice), peanut soup (a peanut-based soup), \u201caj\u00ed de panza\u201d (beef, onions, tomatoes with rice). \u201cI have cooked forever but I have this new business because of my son because I don\u2019t have another way to care for him,\u201d she says. <br \/><br \/>The benefit of her business is that the sales are daily and continuous. The disadvantage is that she is lacking the capital to buy cooking supplies such as: meat, jerky, yucca, rice, noodles, oil, etc. Her dream is to have the food stall most favored by the majority of clients in the area. She hopes to buy the cooking supplies to cook and pay for the preschool expenses of her youngest child. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the five years that she has had this business. For those reasons, Deysi is asking for a loan to buy cooking supplies to cook and pay for the preschool expenses of her youngest son."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3026.85,"image":{"id":1938583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cooking supplies in order to cook and pay for the preschool expenses of her young child.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-08-16T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-15T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":4150,"lender_count":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deisy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Angel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celina Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorenza Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yovany","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valdomira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanitza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-23T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":28500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-07T04:00:00Z","amount":2146.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T04:00:00Z","amount":2185.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T04:00:00Z","amount":2225.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T04:00:00Z","amount":2265.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T04:00:00Z","amount":2307.14},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T04:00:00Z","amount":2349.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T04:00:00Z","amount":2391.89},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T04:00:00Z","amount":2435.41},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T04:00:00Z","amount":2479.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":2524.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T04:00:00Z","amount":2570.82},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T04:00:00Z","amount":2617.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.57},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":318.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":324.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.95},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":335.95},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.07},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":348.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":354.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":361.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":367.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":374.35},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":381.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1284.83,"local_amount":8823.73,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":8850.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711469068},{"amount":1026.31,"local_amount":7048.38,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7070.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296901},{"amount":715.71,"local_amount":4915.31,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4930.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077039}],"funded_date":"2015-08-24T15:43:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Allen","image":1982692}},{"id":932320,"name":"Felix","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felix is a married man.

Her business is selling grains. <br \/><br \/>She is a good mother, supportive, optimistic, generous, patient, responsible and very hard-working. She does her business in the southern part of the city which is considered a semi-urban area. It was created due to a flood of a river that left over 3,000 families homeless. With the few belongings they still possessed they had to settle in these barren lands and start a new life. It has a hot sub-tropical climate with a daily temperature that varies between 21 and 35 degrees Celsius. <br \/><br \/>Cinthia is dark-skinned, with brown eyes, long black hair, short in stature and of robust build. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks with her family and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and for her business. (in the photo she is the first to the right, wearing pink) She shares her life with her family who work and with her son who goes to school. They live in their own room built of wood with a metal roof and sand floor which has electricity, running water and sewage. <br \/><br \/>Due to the need to improve her income she formed a communal bank with people with businesses like: selling second-hand clothing, selling natural health products, weaving, leather handicrafts, a welding shop, a carpenter shop and the sales of groceries to request a loan and improve their businesses.<br \/><br \/>Her business is selling grains like; pinto beans, soya beans, organic quinoa, black potato flour, red beans, corn, sorghum and others. She does her business itinerantly visiting markets and businesses in the area. \"I walk enough pushing my two wheeled cart. I sell by the weight and go out with a load every day\" she comments.

The climate of the area is temperate and humid with temperatures varying throughout the day between 18-27 degrees Celsius. <br \/><br \/>Vilma is dark-skinned, with brown eyes, long, black hair, which she wears in a braid, is short, thin, and uses traditional dress (hat, mantle, and skirt). Her mother tongue is Quechua, which is spoken in the area. Because of the general culture and to run her business, she also speaks Spanish.<br \/><br \/>She lives with her partner, who works selling meat, and with her children; the oldest two study in school and the younger two still are not old enough to go to school. They live in their own home build of adobe, brick, and cement, with a metal roof and tile floor. They do not have a sewage system but have well water that is extracted with a pump, and electricity. <br \/><br \/>Her business is making and selling empanadas and pastries. With a little bit of flour, a teaspoon of Royal-brand baking powder, warm milk, olive oil, a pinch of salt, and one egg to brush over, she bakes delicious empanadas and pastries. \u201cThe homemade dough for empanadas couldn\u2019t be easier to make and has the great advantage of being made with healthy fats like olive oil,\u201d she says. <br \/><br \/>The advantage of her business is that she has a car which she uses to make deliveries and the disadvantage is that she is lacking capital to buy cooking supplies in bulk. Her dream is to sell empanadas in bulk to supermarkets and neighborhood stores. She hopes to buy cooking supplies in bulk to sell empanadas to neighborhood stores.
