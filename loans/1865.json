Her business is candle-making.<br \/><br \/>She is a good mother, independent, hard-working, persevering and very responsible. She does her work at a market in the Plan 3000 zone where homeless flood victims made their homes, 12 kilometers from the city center. The inhabitants arrived from the countryside and around the country and settled in this area, which today contains more than 20% of the total population. It is the poorest district. It has a warm, sub-tropical climate with daytime temperatures that vary between 21-35 degrees Centigrade.<br \/><br \/>Elvira is dark-skinned with gray-brown eyes, has long black hair that she wears tied back, and is short and stocky. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks at home, and she speaks Spanish in society and in her business transactions. (She is the second from the left, dressed in sky blue.) She lives with her 2 children, who both study in school. They live in their own house, which is made of sheet metal and wood, with a corrugated roof and dirt floor and has running water, electricity and sewer service. <br \/><br \/>Because she needs to cover her family's expenses, on this occasion she is leading the group in their application for a loan to improve their businesses. The members' businesses are: neighborhood store, butcher shop, sandwich shop, plaster crafts, drink stand, tire shop and sale of secondhand clothing. Her business is the making and sale of handcrafted candles. She specializes in eco-friendly candle-making from beeswax. The most common waxes used by her are: virgin beeswax (completely natural wax, harvested directly from the hive), sheets of virgin beeswax, yellow beeswax in pearls (filtered for higher quality), natural white beeswax (refined wax which has had the color and the honey scent removed). \u201cBeeswax is the best because of its pleasant aroma and yellow color,\" she says. <br \/><br \/>The advantage of her business is that she has a clientele defined as \"green\"; the disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy the beeswax wholesale. Her dream is to produce wholesale and open a store and stop selling in the street. She hopes to buy beeswax wholesale to make a large quantity of candles and open a store.

She has two children aged 6 and 11 years old. Her business is selling empanadas.<br \/><br \/>She is a good mother, enterprising, dynamic, consistent, active, responsible and very hard working. She has her business in the Southern zone of the city which is an area of intense economic activity which generated the establishment of large markets with innumerable stores and shops. It has a hot sub-tropical climate with a daily temperature that varies between 21 and 35 degrees Celsius. <br \/><br \/>Claudia is dark skinned, with brown eyes, long black hair that she ties back, short in stature and robust in build. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed which she speaks with her family and she speaks Spanish because of the general culture and for her business. (In the photo she is the first to the right wearing a white shirt and has a grey purse). She lives her life with her partner who works as a builder and her two children who study at school. They live in their own house made of sheet metal and wood with a metal roof and brick floor and has running water, electricity and sewage. <br \/><br \/>Her desire to excel made her lead a communal bank of people with businesses such as; selling meals, selling natural medicinal products, weaving, appliance repairs, selling vegetables, a bakery and a bookstore to request a loan to improve their businesses. <br \/><br \/>Her business is making and selling traditional empanadas. Empanadas are a dough shaped like a half moon filled with minced filling that is fried in abundant oil or baked in the oven. There are different kinds such as: El cu\u00f1ap\u00e9 (with rice flour and cheese), el sonso (minced yucca with cheese baked in the oven), el pan de arroz, the corn empanada and others.  \"All of the baked ones are traditional and form part of our daily culture. We have them with coffee or tea and they are irresistible\" she comments. <br \/><br \/>The advantage of her business is that sales are daily and routine. Her disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy the different types of flour by the quintal. Her dream is to have a stable business for her children to follow in her footsteps. She wants to purchase rice, corn, wheat and rye flour and other cooking supplies. This is her second loan with the institution in the two years she has been doing this business.  <br \/><br \/>For these reasons Claudia is requesting a loan to buy flour by the quintal to establish her business to pass on to her children in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2077.69,"image":{"id":1939470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy flour by the quintal to establish her business to pass on to her children in the future.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-08-16T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-15T18:20:01Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yessica Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaquelina            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Yaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramiro               ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lessy Yenny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-25T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":19500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00Z","amount":1445.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T04:00:00Z","amount":1497.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T04:00:00Z","amount":1524.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T04:00:00Z","amount":1552.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T04:00:00Z","amount":1580.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T04:00:00Z","amount":1609.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T04:00:00Z","amount":1638.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T04:00:00Z","amount":1668.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T04:00:00Z","amount":1698.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T04:00:00Z","amount":1729.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T04:00:00Z","amount":1761.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T04:00:00Z","amount":1793.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":248.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.41},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":879.83,"local_amount":6019.9,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":6070.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711469073},{"amount":466.22,"local_amount":3189.93,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3216.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296911},{"amount":731.64,"local_amount":5005.93,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:06:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5048.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077049}],"funded_date":"2015-08-25T14:39:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":929883,"name":"Delfina","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"M\u00e3e solteira de 4 filhas, todas maiores de idade e cada uma em seu lar, vive sozinha  dependedo de negocio de venda de roupa usada.

A large part of the population has small businesses, in addition to raising and fattening farm animals.\r\n \r\nAna Maria is very hard-working and, above all, responsible. She is 51 years old and married to Manuel, with whom she has formed a family including four children, none of whom are now dependent on the couple. Now the couple are grandparents with their first grandchild. \u201cDona Mary,\u201d as she is affectionately known, has sold tacos for some 18 years. She says that she began because a family member of her husband's had a restaurant-bar which he eventually abandoned. Thus Mary's husband came to take charge of the business and they sold tacos.    \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ana Maria intends to purchase a small truck because the one they had was stolen. It would be utilized for the business since they have none at present. Also, Ana Maria lacks the money to purchase feed in large quantities for her pigs. She comments, \u201cIf feed were cheaper, I could produce the amount of fattened pigs that I used to.\u201d Ana Maria used to have 70 pigs just for fattening but the price of feed has risen so much that she doesn't think she can maintain that many. The pigs she recently bought will be raised and fattened in just four months. After this, she expects to use them in her lunch stalls for preparing pork tacos. \r\n\r\nAna Maria has three taco stalls in the municipality, but now she is somewhat preoccupied, because 12 of her mid-sized pigs are sick, and she cannot use them. This really has her concerned because if they die, her investment and earnings will be lost.\r\n\r\nAna Maria's dream is to continue conserving her business and continue offering work to other persons. At present, she has three people working for her.\r\n\r\n  *The photograph was taken at her house alongside a vending wagon for her tacos.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":393.69,"image":{"id":1951670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy

It is a beautiful place; currently, everything is green and the fields are full of corn. The people are very happy because in September, they will be trying the first of the corn.<br \/><br \/>To arrive in this place, one must walk many kilometers because, unfortunately, there is no transportation. During the walk, though, it is possible to appreciate the corn crops, and one can find very nice people. <br \/><br \/>Matilde is a hard working woman, who is dedicated to the well-being of her family. She is 46 yeas old and has been marred for 22 years to Mr. Juventino, who works on the farm. Together, they have formed a family with four children--two of whom are studying, one in university and the other in primary school. <br \/><br \/>For 17 years, Maty--as Matilde is fondly called--has dedicated herself to raising and fattening animals, such as chickens, sheep, and turkeys. For Maty, starting this work was a necessary. She says that what her husband earned wasn't enough to cover the household expenses; as a result, she decided to try this type of work with animals while she was taking care of her children.<br \/><br \/>She remembers that when she started raising her animals, it was with her savings. Later, when she heard about this institution, it was a big help for her, because she could then buy more animals. She remembers that with her first loan, she only bought 2 sheep, and her loans were very small. Little by little, though, her income has grown, and the number of her sheep has grown too, so that now she has 15 sheep. The new loan will be used to buy animals and feed.<br \/><br \/>She buys the animals when they are small; she fattens them and then sells them. Now, she is requesting a loan to buy more sheep and feed for her chickens and turkeys. Maty is very thankful for the support of her loans because with the earnings, she has been able to improve her income and give her children an education. <br \/><br \/>Maty doesn't have any difficulty in this business. It is only when her animals become sick and die that she has a loss of earnings and investment. But when that happens to her animals, she immediately goes to her veterinarian.<br \/><br \/>Maty's goal is for her children to finish studying for a professional career, so that they can improve their quality of life. Her children's education is fundamental to Maty.<br \/><br \/>The members of the group are Teresa and Elidia, who will invest in pigs; Rosa and Elena, who will invest in cows; Diana, who will invest in sheep; Jose Alberto, who will invest in automobile accessories; and Itzel, who will invest in turkeys.<br \/><br \/>* The photograph was taken on the stairs of the city kiosk.

Her business is a food stall.  <br \/><br \/>She is a good mother, independent, patient, generous, friendly, responsible and very hardworking. She runs her business in the Panamericana district of the downtown area shared by public and private sector businesses, such as restaurants, shopping centers, movie theaters, ice cream shops, family-friendly apartment buildings, universities and all types of businesses. The climate is moderate, with daytime temperatures between 18-26 degrees Centigrade.<br \/><br \/>Maritza is dark-skinned, with light brown eyes and short black hair with bangs. She is short and stocky. Her native language is Quechua, which she speaks here, and she speaks Spanish in mainstream culture and for business transactions. (She is standing, the second from the left, wearing a gray, flowered blouse, with short hair, next to the gentleman in the blue sweater.) She lives with her husband, who works as a driver, and her daughters. The eldest studies and works, and the younger ones are in school and work in their mother's business. They live in their own home, which is made of adobe with a corrugated roof and cement floors. The home has electricity and well water that is drawn with a pump. <br \/><br \/>Her dream is to improve her business, and this inspired her to form a lending group to apply for a loan to improve their businesses. The members have businesses such as selling second-hand clothing, selling vegetables, a lathe, selling food, leather crafts, a butcher shop specializing in poultry, a tire shop and selling dairy products. <br \/><br \/>She sells traditional dishes by the day. The custom in that place is to dedicate each day of the week to different traditional dishes; for example, MONDAY, \"escabeche\" (served cold and made of pig skins bathed in vinegar, oil and salt); TUESDAY, \"ranga\" (the main ingredient of this dish is beef tripe, served with yellow chili peppers, pepper, cumin and garlic); WEDNESDAY, \"silpancho\" (which means thin-cut meat, pounded); THURSDAY, \"tranca pecho\" (a thick, rustic sandwich meant for laborers and construction workers, but also a taste treat for teens and young men and women from all social classes); FRIDAY, \"pique macho\" (consisting of chunks of beef in their own juice and fried sausage with a side of french fries); SATURDAY, \"lappin\" (beef brisket cooked in a frying pan with peeled fava beans and potatoes cooked in their skins); SUNDAY, \"sopa de man\u00ed\" (peanut-based soup). \"Every day of the week is dedicated to specific dishes that can be found in different traditional restaurants or food stalls all over the city and in the outlying areas,\" she says. <br \/><br \/>The advantage for her business is that she sells every day; the disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy tables and chairs to expand her business. Her dream is to open a big restaurant. She hopes to buy dining room furniture so she can wait on more customers and improve her business. This is her fourth round of loans with the institution since she started her business 10 years ago. <br \/><br \/>That is why Maritza is requesting a loan to buy dining room furniture to sell food every day and improve her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1940.33,"image":{"id":1939523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her business is second-hand clothing sales. \r\n\r\nShe is enterprising, independent, persevering, patient, optimistic, responsible, and a very hard worker. She does business in the Mutualista area, which is in high demand among people wanting to have a store or any kind of business. The adjacent Mutalista Market is heavily visited by shoppers from throughout the city. The city has a warm subtropical climate, with daytime temperatures ranging from 21 to 35 degrees Celsius. \r\n\r\nEricka has a dark complexion, brown eyes, and long black hair that she wears pulled back. She is short in stature and has a robust build. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which is what she speaks with her family. She also speaks Spanish due to the general culture and her business. In the photo she is the first on the left, wearing a black sweater and light blue pants. She shares her life with her family members, who work independently and live in their own house built of sheet metal and wood with a corrugated iron roof and a brick floor. The house has potable water, electricity, and a sewage system.  \r\n\r\nBecause of her desire to succeed, Ericka joined with a group of people who work together to apply for loans and improve their businesses, which include: natural medicine product sales, food sales, textile making, vegetable sales, bakery, bookstore, drink sales, and construction service. \r\n\r\nEricka's business is selling second-hand clothing, such as pants, shorts, jerseys, t-shirts, shirts, blouses, sweaters, and jackets. All week during the daytime hours, she works as a street vendor, visiting different business and pedestrian areas. Her business is based on seasonal clothing sales: \"I offer a wide variety of second-hand clothing, shoes, bags, and accessories. All the clothing has been checked piece by piece to verify its authenticity and excellent condition,\" she says. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she is constantly selling clothing, and the disadvantage is that she lacks the capital to invest and expand her stock.

Elijah also has a side hustle business that he does to supplement the meager income he earns from farming. <br \/><br \/>Some time back, Elijah joined a Njeruni group composed of mostly marginalized farmers who could not secure loans from formal financial institutions.

After being successfully registered into the company, they went through a training of basic financial and business skills. <br \/><br \/>Elijah has applied for a loan of 30,000 KES to purchase poultry. He is looking to venture into poultry farming. With time, he will expand. Income generated from these investments will enable him to meet high farming expenses.

He is elegant and admirable in spirit and effort. He is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in his village because of his resilience despite personal challenges and his passion to support his children as a primary caregiver. The living conditions in the Kitale area are very tough and you need to have tough skin in order to survive. Samwel has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. Because of the hardcore poverty in his village, Samwel started practicing mixed farming 10 years ago. His sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg sales. However, these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market. The Kitale area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Samwel is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike, he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. <br \/><br \/>Samwel is very determined to succeed. Because he is much disciplined with finances, he plans that he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and for his children through accumulated profits. Samwel's dream is to provide a secure future for his children by paying tuition fees for them. You will help him realize his dream through your loan.<br \/><br \/>For Samwel, nothing is impossible.

She is married and has a 22-year-old son and a 17-year-old daughter.  Her business is selling jewelry and household products.  She is a good mother, sincere, understanding, steadfast, responsible, and very hard-working.  She carries out her business in the Pampahasi area located just north of the city at the foot of the skirts of the hill where the streets are sloping and steep.  It has a cold and dry climate with a temperature that varies daily from 0-12 degrees centigrade. <br \/><br \/>Carmen has brown skin, grayish-brown eyes, and long brown hair.  She is short and has a robust physique.  Her native language us the Aymar\u00e1 that she speaks with her family, but she speaks Spanish for general purposes and for the work that she does.  She shares her life with her husband, who is in the military, and their children; the eldest studies and works, and the youngest attends school.  They live in their own little house made of brick and cement.  It has a corrugated steel roof and a wood floor, as well as electricity, potable water, and a sewage system.  <br \/><br \/>Her desire to overcome and the need to help with the university expenses of her oldest child led her to ask for a loan to improve her business.  She works as a street vendor selling stainless steel jewelry like earrings, rings, necklaces, etc.; and articles for the home like purses, ornaments, silverware, and other items.  \"The gold and the silver can provoke allergic reactions in some people, which does not happen with stainless steel.  Additionally, it does not rust and it resists substances like chlorine, water, soap, and perfumes\u2026,\" she says.<br \/><br \/>An advantage to her business is that her jewelry is relatively new and the public is innovative.  A disadvantage is her lack of capital in order to buy the stainless steel jewelry at wholesale.  Her dream is to increase her working capital in order to improve her sales, and she wishes to purchase wholesale stainless steel jewelry so that she can offer a larger variety to her customers.  <br \/><br \/>This is her first cycle of loans with the institution in the four years that she has dedicated herself to this work.  It is for these reasons that Carmen asks for the loan to buy wholesale stainless steel jewelry in order to get a better income and help with her son's university expenses."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":193.15,"image":{"id":1940446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy wholesale stainless steel jewelry in order to get a better income and help with her son's university expenses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-08-16T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-15T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-06-27T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":339.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":483.41},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":495.89},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":542.51},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T04:00:00Z","amount":557.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T04:00:00Z","amount":568.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":605.36},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":635.91},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T04:00:00Z","amount":650.26},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T04:00:00Z","amount":688.75},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":713},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T04:00:00Z","amount":719.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.21},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.64},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.12},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.22},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.85},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.4},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120.5,"local_amount":822.99,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:35Z","rounded_local_amount":831.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296925},{"amount":72.65,"local_amount":496.13,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":501.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077062}],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T21:50:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":923807,"name":"Justin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Justin has an entrepreneurial spirit, is active, vibrant, and constantly struggles to be able to get ahead.

She also grows maize, among other crops. Despite prevailing animal diseases, she finds dairy farming to be the most enjoyable commercial farming activity. Besides dairy farming, she has a deep connection with gardening. In African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive hobby for women. You really don't have to be born with a green thumb to give life to a glorious garden; any woman with a homestead and a few square feet of earth is doing her best to make her little corner of the world more gracious and beautiful.

She is a mixed farmer, who grows maize and vegetables for both consumption and sale. She also runs a small business. <br \/><br \/>Janice is seeking a loan, with which she intends to purchase a high-quality dairy cow. The dairy business is very profitable in this area. Most families rely on milk to feed their children and prepare their meals. Ugali is the staple food of people from the Chuka area of Kenya, where Mitheru village lies. Ugali is tasteless, as it is made from pure maize flour and water. To make this into a mouthwatering delicacy, it has to be accompanied by sour milk and well-cooked vegetables, and meat for those who can afford it. Milk is also an ingredient in the preparation of vegetables. The heavy reliance on milk allows dairy farmers to do well in this region. Milk prices are always high because of the high demand. Little product marketing is required here, because milk is milk. <br \/><br \/>With your loan, Janice will not only reduce the amount of money she must spend on milk for the family, but also she will increase her income from the sale of milk. She will use the profits to grow the business and to keep supporting her

En un principio, Eulalia solicit\u00f3 tres mil pesos a otra financiera, dinero que utiliz\u00f3 para comprar tres borreguitos, con el tiempo el n\u00famero de animales ha ido en aumento.

She has been married to Se\u00f1or Eulalio for 24 years, and together they have formed a family.  They have four children, and all but one, who is studying in high school, are now independent.  Eulalia has been raising and fattening lambs and cows for five years. She says, \"As mothers we have an obligation to give the best to our children, which is why I decided to start my own business\"<br \/><br \/>Initially, Eulalia requested three thousand pesos from another finance company and used the money to purchase three lambs.  Over time, the number of animals has been growing, and now she is planning to purchase two calves. Normally, she keeps them for a year in order to sell them once they reach a good size and weight. Do\u00f1a Eulalia devotes more than five hours a day to them.  Mornings, she feeds them in her own corral, but she has to take them to the pasture to graze in the afternoons.  She has to work very hard in order for them to reach the weight and size that are ideal for selling them to the best purveyors of barbecue.<br \/><br \/>Eulalia is very happy with her little animals, although now she will have more work to do with her two cows. Fortunately, when they get sick she can give them injections herself; her son, who is a veterinarian, taught her how to do it.  Do\u00f1a Eulalia's goal is to be able to continue increasing the number of her animals, although her greatest desire is that her youngest son may complete a professional degree. \"I didn't study, and although I would like to find better work, I can't, because I don't have sufficient skills. I would not like the same thing to happen to my son\", commented Do\u00f1a Eulalia. <br \/><br \/>In the community where the group members live, young people usually only complete secondary school, but the parents always try hard to convince them to continue preparing themselves.  <br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken in a small garden in the municipality."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":439.46,"image":{"id":1947435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase two cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Juan Cote, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-08-16T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-15T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eulalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2191.64},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2304.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2441.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2550.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2691.04},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2820.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.43},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":138.83,"local_amount":2192,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2245.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701400},{"amount":146,"local_amount":2305.25,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2361.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204496},{"amount":154.63,"local_amount":2441.5,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2500.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291917}],"funded_date":"2015-08-19T19:29:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanora Brennan","image":null}},{"id":923798,"name":"Jacob","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacob is a 35-year-old man who is hardworking, humble, and full of life.

His upbringing was challenging and he never went to college so that he could secure a formal job, but he did not surrender to that. He has been practicing farming for the past 10 years. Through farming, he has been able to take care of his family. His main source of income has been milk, eggs and crop farming, and through these ventures, he has supported his family because he is the only breadwinner. Jacob passionately loves farming. Jacob stated that the most enjoyable bit about farming is \u201cit gives me personal fulfillment and feeds my family.\" <br \/><br \/>Although he has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious man. He has been facing challenges transporting his produce from the farm to the market. That is why he is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. The Kapsowar area is a rural town and roads are very poor, and transporting goods for Jacob has always been a \u201cnightmare.\u201d He has been suffering losses because goods reach the market when they are not fresh, hence fetching a low price. Vegetables and milk are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market. Through the loan, he will be able to achieve his dream. He plans to employ someone who will be helping him in farm work and in transporting the produce to the market, hence impacting the society positively through creation of employment. <br \/><br \/>Increased profits from the loan will allow him to repay the loan fully and be able to permanently change his living conditions and assure his aging parents of a secure future. His biggest dream is to be able to take care of his family by giving them a solid education because he believes that education is the key to success. You can be a part of this dream.

He is 28 years old, hard-working and energetic. He hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya, an area that is blessed with good climatic conditions and favorable weather patterns that favor farming. Paul was raised in a humble family and he never got the opportunity to go to college because of a lack of tuition fees. As a result of this, he never got any formal employment and didn\u2019t surrender to that. He started farming and, through farming, he has been able to take care of his family and also to take care of his parents. <br \/><br \/>Paul's sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg-selling. These products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. The Kapsowar area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Paul is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike.

Fue entonces que decidi\u00f3 iniciar a vender antojitos mexicanos como chicharrones preparados, patitas de pollo, elotes, esquites, entre otros. El negocio result\u00f3 productivo porque a los clientes les gustaba el saz\u00f3n de Lucila y as\u00ed permaneci\u00f3 durante dos a\u00f1os.

It\u2019s small with very cheerful, but above all hardworking, people. They still preserve their mother tongue and have patronage festivals that last approximately three or four days; they\u2019re days with a lot of celebrating. <br \/><br \/>Lucila is a very enthusiastic and hardworking 32 year old woman. She has been married for a long time to Arnulfo who builds homes, and they are parents to four children. Three of them are studying in primary school. Previously, the family lived in the capital of the country, but living in the city meant a lot of expenses; her husband\u2019s minimum wage salary was not sufficient to pay all of the household expenses. It was then she decided to start selling Mexican snacks like prepared chicharrones, chicken feet, corn on the cob, and esquite (fried and seasoned corn) among other things. <br \/><br \/>The business was profitable because customers liked Lucila\u2019s seasoning, and it remained liked that for two years. Every afternoon outside of the house she rented, she placed a small table to sell. But unfortunately, other ladies began businesses very similar to Lucila\u2019s. Lucila\u2019s business declined little by little, and she had to give it up. One day, her husband had a rough time too and was left without a job. That was when they were forced to return to their community where they have been living for ten years. <br \/><br \/>Seven years ago, Lucila decided to start selling sweets in front of a primary school, but she would like to resume selling Mexican snacks because she knows the profits are higher. By selling one popsicle she only earns one peso, but with a small plate of food she earns around 10. At the moment, Lucila does not have the money to start a food business, but she will work to achieve it. That\u2019s why she needs a loan to invest in sweets. Her income will support her husband with the household expenses, and she will continue to save. However, Lucila\u2019s biggest dream is to improve her home. Up until now, it has a dirt floor and the windows are enough to keep out the cold, but she wants a better home for her family. <br \/><br \/>The members of the group are Gabriel (who will invest in pigs and car sales), Cristina (who will invest in a repair shop), Carmen (who will invest in turkeys), and Angel (who will invest in a grocery store). <br \/><br \/>*The photo was taken together with one of the cars Gabriel is selling.

She attended primary school. In the community she is known as \"Chela\" or \"Rubi.\" In the nine years since she was widowed, she has been father and mother to her five children, of whom only one adolescent depends on her economically. With the firm resolve that  the household income be greater, and due to the distance of the grocery stores, she began 11 years ago with a little store. She comments that when she started out, she bought 5 liters of oil, 10 kilos of beans and rice, 5 of milk, and 10 of pasta for soup, Knorr tomato and Knorr Swiss, since she was afraid of not selling the merchandise. As the months passed, the little store achieved stability and she increased the merchandise offered, so much so that today she sells rice, beans, sugar, oil, Minsa corn flour, flour, soup, tuna, mayonnaise, canned chiles, crackers, bread, eggs, cheese, tortillas, and soft drinks. \r\n\r\nIn addition to selling groceries, five years ago she began the sale of cosmetics by catalog and natural medicines, increasing her income. \"It is not necessary to go out and show the catalogs. My customers come to the house, and I am grateful to them since this way I don't have to neglect my little store.\"\r\n\r\nThe earnings obtained have allowed her to offer an education to her children, to acquire a new stove, a bed, and a refrigerator, and to satisfy her personal necessities. At this time she will use the loan for the purchase of sugar, soup, rice, oil, soft drinks, and detergents in order to continue with service in her little store from 7:00 am to 8:00 pm, and sometimes a little later.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to each one of the people who make it possible for us to achieve our dreams when we are granted a loan to invest in our business or begin a new one. The loans that have been granted to me have given me an advantage,\" are the words of Do\u00f1a Chela.\r\n\r\nExpanding the infrastructure where her store is located is Do\u00f1a Chela's challenge during this loan cycle, since she comments that the space where it is is a little small, and she hopes to display natural medicines in the store.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken in the back part of Do\u00f1a Chela's little store. She is the one wearing a white blouse and a checked skirt.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1732.5,"image":{"id":1946747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy sugar, soup, rice, oil, soft drinks, and detergent for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tres Valles, Veracruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-08-17T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-16T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rubicela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorge Alejendro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ciria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lilian Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Angel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":495,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":8005.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701406},{"amount":695.07,"local_amount":11233.45,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:38Z","rounded_local_amount":11241.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204505},{"amount":542.43,"local_amount":8766.55,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":8773.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291926}],"funded_date":"2015-08-21T01:13:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":932479,"name":"Carlito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carlito is a married man from Talibon, Bohol.

Everyone knows her as \u201cChalia.\u201d She is married to Miguel Angel, who works as a carpenter. They are the parents of 2 adult children. For 5 years they have lived alone in their home. <br \/><br \/>Chalia makes a living from helping her husband with carpentry, sanding, varnishing, and measuring the furniture that they produce. Likewise, she began selling clothing on foot. In the evenings after helping her husband with his carpentry and when the sun has gone down a little she goes out to travel the streets to the home of each of her customers to show them the clothing. <br \/><br \/>With the profits made from carpentry, they have been able to purchase a lot where they have installed a permanent carpenter\u2019s workshop and they do not have to pay rent, which means more profits.

raising sugar cane play the principal role in the economy, the traditions and customs are Mazatec, since there was a settlement of this culture in the community.\r\n\r\nRecently in one of the communities, a group called \"El Polvor\u00f3n\" was formed, since it is related to the name of the settlement where it is located. The members of the group are: Margarita, who sells food; Rosario, who sells clothing; Herlinda, who sells soft drinks; Juliana, Araceli, and Florida, who sell tamales; Jes\u00fas, who has an internet cafe; and Carlota, who sells tortillas. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Florida is one of the members of \"El Polvor\u00f3n.\" She is 40 years old. She is married to Se\u00f1or Hernesto. Together they have four children, of whom only two depend on them economically. They go to school in the community. Since she was a girl, Do\u00f1a Flor, as she is known in the neighborhood, learned from her mother and grandmother how to make tamales of different types, the orange ones being the most emphasized and flavorful.\r\n\r\nSix years ago she decided to begin the sale of tamales, since the household expenses increased, and offering the best to their children is the most important thing for her and her husband. Two days a week Do\u00f1a Flor prepares the dough, shreds the chicken breast, prepares the sauce, and washes and dries the banana and tlanepa [Mexican pepperleaf] leaves in order to proceed to precook the dough, roll the dough with the meat and sauce in order to wrap the dough and tie it with izote leaves. She places them in a steamer and cooks them for approximately 40 minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen the tamales are ready, she begins the second part of the process. She puts them in a tray, takes some tongs, and goes through the streets of the community, visiting her customers. Some others come to her house in search of the tamales ([of different types]: huaraches, yucca, rancheros, red, bean, folded, and elote). Her two children help her to deliver tamales to nearest customers, and sometimes they accompany her to carry the tray. She sells a minimum or 200 tamales. \"I am happy with my business and with this way of preserving [the custom] of traditional food.\"\r\n\r\nShe will invest the loan received in the purchase of corn, lard, chiles, and meat, continuing with her business. With the earnings, she helps her husband with the expenses, and they have been able to offer their children a good quality of life.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Flor comments that she hopes to be able to set up a little grocery store or a kitchen that produces reasonably priced food, and she will continue with her sale of tamales.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are grateful to those who have made possible each one of the loans. They are the members of the group \"El Polvor\u00f3n.\" Do\u00f1a Flor is wearing a traditional dress of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1947585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn, lard, chili peppers, and meat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Miguel Soyaltepec, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-08-17T01:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-16T01:00:03Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Herlinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Araceli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlota ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":34000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":17000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":17184.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701409},{"amount":531.25,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:39Z","rounded_local_amount":8592.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204508},{"amount":531.25,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":8592.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291929}],"funded_date":"2015-08-17T01:56:25Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":932517,"name":"Adan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adan is an orphan and he lives with his uncle who is also his godfather.

Five years ago a group formed in this community and the name \"flor de lim\u00f3n\u201d was chosen for the group as they like when the trees are in flower.

She is married to Leonel and they are the parents of a 4 year old daughter. \"I started my business shortly after learning that I was pregnant as we had to prepare for future expenses\". That was how Vale motivated by her baby started to sell woman's lingerie by catalog. Thanks to the profits she obtained and when she had saved what she needed she decided to sell soft drinks of different flavors, and the sale of large containers of bottled water. These businesses she does at her house so she can take care of her family and continue with her sources of income. <br \/><br \/>During a week Vale sells an average of 30 containers of water as the area is a bit isolated. On the average she sells 6 to 9 cases of soft drinks. She goes to purchase the orders from her clients every week or two and she collects on weekends. When she is out distributing or out collecting money her husband takes care of the soft drink sales. For Vale the loans have given her a great opportunity to grow in each of her businesses as her invested capital is greater and the larger the investment the greater are her profits. \"I joined the communal bank in 2013 and I am happy to belong to it as with each loan that she has received my business has grown little by little\" <br \/><br \/>At this time Vale will invest the loan in buying soft drinks and 30 gallons of water as with the heat wave her clients consume a greater amount of soft drinks and water. <br \/><br \/>The group is grateful to Visi\u00f3nFund M\u00e9xico and Kiva for each of the loans they have been awarded. <br \/><br \/>\"These are the members of the group.

Those who live on the edges of the railroad usually throw them bags of food because if they get off of the train they could miss the trip and have to wait until it comes around again.<br \/><br \/>In one of the communities, a group was formed named Arco\u00edris de Colores [Rainbow of Colors]. The members chose the name because it is very uncommon to see a rainbow in the city. The members of the group and their occupations are:<br \/><br \/>Maribel, Margarita, Jorge, Arcelia - Food sales<br \/>Reyna - Taco sales<br \/>Liliana - Stationery store<br \/>Maria - Shoe sales<br \/><br \/>Liliana is 27 years old, and recently became a single mother of a baby that is 4 months old. Lili, as she is called, has earned a living selling novelties and soft drinks for 9 years. With the income she earned she helped her mother with the home expenses, and from the time she found out she was pregnant she started to save for the costs of the childbirth. For the last two months she has been in charge of the stationery store that her mother owns. She says, \"My mom gave me the store where she had spent 15 years of her life as a form of inheritance for my son. I'm grateful to her for her unconditional support.\"<br \/><br \/>The stationery store is open from 8 in the morning until 8 at night because this is what the customers require. This time Lili is requesting a loan to pay for part of the seasonal order (booklets, notebooks, pens, pencils, erasers, pencil sharpeners, clay, and glue). School is about to begin, and with that, the sales increase.<br \/><br \/>Lili has consolidated the stationery store and the novelty items in such a way that she can work on both activities without neglecting either of the two, nor her baby. Her future plans are to expand the stationery store and include sewing goods because walking to another neighborhood for a button, string or elastic is too tiring, and her customers have suggested this to her, and her mother is willing to support her.

Such is the case of Joyce who at the age of 45 has a small parcel of land. Joyce is a very hardworking, very honest and warm-hearted farmer who hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya, an area that has one of the best weather patterns on earth for farming. <br \/><br \/>Joyce is the proud mother of a lovely family whom she adores and always protects. Joyce's upbringing was very challenging, and because of this she promised herself that she would work hard to get out of poverty. That is why she started farming six years ago. Through farming, she has been able to earn a decent income. Joyce is the breadwinner of her family, and this really pushes her to work hard so that her children will have a bright future and her parents will have a comfortable life. <br \/><br \/>Joyce is seeking a loan to buy seeds and start horticultural farming so that she can use the excess space on her land. She dreams of buying more land and increasing her horticultural farming. Accessing funds is very difficult for a woman in Africa, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, Joyce is optimistic that her dream will be realized and her life will completely change. Through the income from horticultural farming Joyce will assure her children a bright future and will be able to pay tuition fees for her siblings who depend on her. Through your loan, the promise of supporting small-scale farmers will be achieved.<br \/><br \/>For Joyce, nothing is impossible.

In April they schedule the Carnaval (parades in decorated floats through the principal streets of the city), and different troupes participate in it, now including television actors and actresses.\r\n\r\nA group formed by eight hard-working women who seek the well-being of their families bears the name \"El Regreso.\" The name comes from the action taken by seven of the members of the group to form a new group and apply again to Vision Fund M\u00e9xico for loans.\r\n\r\n[The members are]: Juana, who sells shoes, stationery, clothing, and handbags; Maria, who sells clothing; Luisa, who sells clothing and does dress-making; Laura and Amelia, who sell food; Leidy, who sells shoes, bags, and wallets; Roci\u00f3, who sells groceries and has a tortilla shop; and Ana, who sells shoes. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Luisa is a very hard-working woman. She is 71 years old. She attended primary school. She is married to Se\u00f1or Aizides. They are the parents of eight children, who have made them grandparents, and the grandchildren have made them great-grandparents, transforming them into a numerous family. For 38 years, Do\u00f1a Licha, as she is known, has sold clothing for women and made clothing for others. She comments that the need to learn sewing arose from her children, for whom she had to make clothing or have it made for dances, without thinking that it would become her business.\r\n\r\nDuring the 38 years of experience with the machine, she has made dresses for brides, quincea\u00f1eras [15-year-old girls' birthday celebrations], first communions, confirmations, school completions, and dances, all according to the tastes of her customers, who place their orders in advance.\r\n\r\nThe earnings that she has received allowed her to offer an education to her children and remodel the house. She has bought five machines and maintained the machines, and in the same way, this has allowed her to offer a good quality of life to her family. Now she pays her personal expenses with the earnings and reinvests in her businesses.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Licha has sewn since then in the comfort of her bedroom, since she comments that it is where she feels most at ease. She makes the designs on a table. She does the cutting on her bed. Alongside her machine are the needles, pins, threads, buttons, closures, and scissors. She comments that in this way she finds everything that she needs. To complete her customers' orders, she sews during the day, the afternoon, and sometimes during the night.\r\n\r\nThe loans that have been granted to Do\u00f1a Licha have been invested in the purchase of shirts, skirts, blouses, and pants, as well as pins, closures, thread, needles, bias bindings, and fabrics, continuing with her activities. At this time, she will invest the loan in the purchase of skirts, pants, blouses, shirts, and t-shirts.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for the support that was offered to us by granting us the loans to help our businesses.\"\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken in the space where Do\u00f1a Licha sews. On the bed is a dress that she was finishing. She is the one wearing a flowered blouse and an orange skirt.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2695,"image":{"id":1946765,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy skirts, pants, blouses, shirts, and t-shirts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tierra Blanca, Ver","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-08-17T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-16T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":3850,"lender_count":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Aidee ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa Aurelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leidy Yanira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ana Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":62000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":6200},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6200},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":6200},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6200},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6200},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6200},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6200},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6200},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6200},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":6200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1155,"local_amount":18600,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":18680.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701403},{"amount":770,"local_amount":12400,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":12453.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204502},{"amount":770,"local_amount":12400,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:56Z","rounded_local_amount":12453.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291923}],"funded_date":"2015-08-20T17:19:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":929235,"name":"Rakiswiligri Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Eveline, est une femme \u00e2g\u00e9e de 39 ans mari\u00e9e m\u00e8re de 6 enfants.

Sari-sari (a term used for variety) stores sell different kinds of products from biscuits, candies, canned goods, noodles, products used for personal hygiene and the like, which are involved in every individual\u2019s daily living. This is considered as one of the most common businesses built by ordinary people since it provides commodities for people. \r\n\r\nWith this fact, Milagros was enticed to get in touch with this kind of business. She is 51 years old, married to Dioscoro and a resident of Santa Barbara, Iloilo, Philippines. They are working with determination to pursue the needs of their family. The income they get from the store helps them for their daily expenditures. \r\n\r\nHowever, the profits they get from the business are sometimes insufficient. It is because at times, she finds it hard to maintain supplies of various products due to financial instability. This is why she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan that she will utilize to buy additional products for her inventory. With more products displayed in her store, she can ably have a greater increase in her income. \r\n\r\nIn due time, she hopes that she grows in progress and that her business will boost its sales.

The members say that they decided to give themselves this name because previously, they had been working with another micro-finance institution, and with other persons. Unfortunately, it went very badly for them because some people did poorly with their payments, and they had very serious problems. So, when they heard about VF Mexico, they felt hopeful about cleaning up their credit history and moving forward in their businesses. <br \/><br \/>Do\u00f1a Cristina is an exemplary woman who is very cheerful and hardworking. She is 42 years old, she is married to Se\u00f1or Gabino, and they have three daughters.  The youngest daughter is studying in primary school and still depends upon them.  <br \/><br \/>Do\u00f1a Cristina, or \u201cCris\u201d, as she is affectionately called, says that she started her business when her first daughter was born. Her husband has always worked selling tacos, so they made a great effort, and put together enough money so that after one year they were able to purchase a small cart in order to sell tacos as mobile vendors.  Now they have two carts so that they can both work and cover two locations in the city. <br \/><br \/>Cris stations her little cart in the marketplace from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, while her husband is later, until 9:00 or 10:00 PM. Her big difficulty is the competition.  In the community in which she lives, a large segment of the population works selling tacos, and there are even more vendors in the city, selling food at different spots.  However, she\u2019s not worried. \u201cAs long as my businesses are allowing us to keep covering our expenses and paying off the loan, I\u2019m not worried, and we\u2019ll continue with the two businesses\u201d, Do\u00f1a Cris said happily.<br \/><br \/>She will use her loan to purchase two pigs, firewood, gas, and supplies for the preparation of tacos. Together, Do\u00f1a Cris and her husband will slaughter the animals and prepare the pork tacos. <br \/><br \/>The goal of Do\u00f1a Cris is to be able to grow her businesses in order to keep supporting her daughter so that she may complete a professional degree program. <br \/><br \/>The members of the group are: Ana Mar\u00eda, who will invest in tacos; J. Carmen, in tires; Ana Mar\u00eda F. and Mar\u00eda in shoes; Juan Luis, in a cyber caf\u00e9; Jos\u00e9 Juan, Francisco, and Mar\u00eda Elena, in tortillas; Diana Laura in costume jewelry; and Nancy, in linens. <br \/><br \/>The photograph was taken in Do\u00f1a Ana Mar\u00eda's house.

You can see the fisherman go out in their motorboats and rowboats to fish. Then they go by foot to sell their catch in the co-op, or in the palm huts which are located on the shore of the reservoir. The fish are then kept in small tanks, and when diners arrive, these fish are served fresh.\r\nIn one of the neighborhoods, a group of 6 people formed to request a loan from Visi\u00f3n F M\u00e9xico to grow their businesses.

The members of this group are:\r\nSilvestre - he sells shoes\r\nMar\u00eda, Fabiola, Lorena and Mayra - they clothing\r\nZoila - she sells sodas\r\nFabiola is one of the members of this group. She is 38 years old, and everybody in the community knows her as \"Fabi\", though her very closes friends call her \"Fiona\" because of her personality. She has a son who is 12 years old. He goes to the local school. Since she was 16, Fabi has sold clothing for men and women. She sold this clothing by foot, and she says that she ran around the streets of the town with the clothing on a dolly to display all of her merchandise to potential clients.\r\nThe success of her efforts, combined with loans, has been such that she has established a clothing store located in the town center, displaying the clothing on mannequins and hangers.\r\nOnce every month, Fabi goes to purchase clothing of different styles, colors and sizes for her clients. In this way she is always able to satisfy their demand. Three years ago she decided to begin selling toys as well, and she sells the most around Christmas and the Epiphany, and Children's Day.\r\nFor the past ten years she has lifted the curtain of the shop at 8 a.m., indicating that she is open for business. She closes at 2 in the afternoon in order to pick her son up and feed him lunch, then she returns at 4 p.m. with her son, and closes the store at 8 p.m.\r\n\"My business and my tireless work have enabled me to give my son the best, and have ensured that I don't need to depend on anybody. I feel useful, productive, and like a hard worker.

This community can be accessed by personal vehicles or shared taxis.  The water that is used by its residents comes from a spring.  <br \/><br \/>Twelve people from this community have formed a group called \u201cEl Castillo 2\u201d, which is also the name of their community.  There are currently 12 members in the group:<br \/>\u2022\tRebeca has a bakery.<br \/>\u2022\tAlicia sells ornamental plants.<br \/>\u2022\tLaudelina sells snacks.<br \/>\u2022\tHilaria and Margarita sell shoes through catalogs.<br \/>\u2022\tEvarista sells chicken and trinkets.<br \/>\u2022\tMinivera and Heriberta sell soft drinks.<br \/>\u2022\tEduardo sells cornmeal and corn.  <br \/>\u2022\tLidia and Lizeth sell desserts.<br \/>\u2022\tElodia sells tacos.  <br \/><br \/>Do\u00f1a Evarista is one of the members of the group.  She is 48 years old and married to Sr. Domingo.  They have two daughters who are now grown and work in the capital in order to support them.  For the past 12 years, Do\u00f1a Evarista has been selling live and butchered chickens.  In order to provide good service to her customers, she wakes up at 5:00 A.M. in order to light the fire pit and start boiling a metal pot full of water for processing chickens.  The chickens are submerged into the hot water so that the feathers can be removed.  Once the chickens are dressed, they are prepared for sale for her customers who begin arriving at her place at 7:00 A.M.  When she finishes dressing chickens at the end of the day, there is always a customer who enjoys her product so she is always willing to satisfy the needs of that customer.  <br \/><br \/>Her profits from this business, along with her husband\u2019s salary, is how she was able to provide an education for her daughters, pay for her household expenses, and continue in her work.  Do\u00f1a Evarista says that the festival days celebrated in her community is when she sells fire roasted chickens.  On those same days she prepares 20 kilos of mole paste, which can be dissolved in a pot of delicious chicken soup.  <br \/><br \/>A little less than a year ago, one of her grown daughters came to visit her and brought back bows, hair pins, scrunchies, hairpins, leggings, and underwear for women and children.  This allowed her to start another business.  Since then, she has assigned her daughter the task of buying more merchandise each month.  <br \/><br \/>\u201cI am happy with my small businesses because I am always able to support my family.\u201d  On this occasion, Evarista\u2019s loan will be used to buy 50 chickens, feed, and wire mesh for expanding the pen where the animals are kept so that they don\u2019t escape.  <br \/><br \/>The members are pleased with the loans that have been issued and appreciate the trust that has been placed in them.  *The photograph was taken in Do\u00f1a Margarita\u2019s yard, which is about 20 meters away from the spring that supplies the community with drinking water.

His plan is to later sell the inventory at a higher price, using his understanding of the market conditions and prices. <br \/><br \/>Income from this investment will help Bedford to buy services and supplies for his farm such as seeds, fertilizers, herbicides, and veterinary healthcare."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":111.69,"image":{"id":1942588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-17T11:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-16T11:20:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bedford","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3244.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3339.18},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3436.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3537.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3640.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3746.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3856.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3969.19},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4085.19},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4204.57},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4327.45},{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4453.98},{"due_date":"2016-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4584.09},{"due_date":"2016-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4718.06},{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4855.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.37},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.41},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.47},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.57},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.69},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.85},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.05},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.27},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.54},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.18},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":111.69,"local_amount":11168.61,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:44Z","rounded_local_amount":11377.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024026}],"funded_date":"2015-09-14T16:58:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JenniferN"}},{"id":930676,"name":"Mabelis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ella es Mabelis, es una campesina aplicada, honesta y carism\u00e1tica que se dedica a la cr\u00eda de cerdos y aves (Pizco), un tipo de ave muy com\u00fan en la regi\u00f3n pero no tan comercial debido a lo dif\u00edcil de mantenerla.\n\nElla es madre de dos hijos tiene 14 y 16 a\u00f1os de edad, se encuentra estudiando y en sus ratos libres apoyan a su madre en su profesi\u00f3n, son una familia muy unidad que juntos tiran para un mismo camino, el camino del progreso, quieren mejorar sus condiciones de vida, comer mejor, vivir mejor, vender mucho m\u00e1s, ser unos comerciantes \u00e9xitos y constituir una empresa que perdure en el tiempo.\n\nCon el firme prop\u00f3sito de mejorar su empresa, Mabelis quiere solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de aves (Pizco) y la compra de lechones, con los que aumentara sus animales buscando mejores acuerdos y convenios que representen una buena utilidad que sirva para sus planes de mejoramiento de calidad de vida.\n","en":"Mabelis is a diligent, honest and charismatic woman of the countryside who works raising pigs and poultry (pizco, a very common type of poultry in the region but which is not very commercial because of how difficult it is to keep them).<br \/><br \/>She is the mother of two children, ages 14 and 16 who are students and, in their free time, they help their mother in her profession.

He gets up at the first hour in the morning in order to tend to his business of raising dairy cows and selling poultry and vegetables, as well as some personal business (motorcycle business) he engages in to supplement the meager income he earns. \r\n\r\nDaniel is seeking a loan to purchase modern farming implements.

Their family may not have the luxuries of life but they are happy and content that they can eat three times a day and can send their children to school.\r\n\r\nMaria Fe has operated a tricycle for ten years which her  husband drives. A tricycle carries up to four passengers. In the Philippines, especially in the provinces like Palawan, the tricycle is a common means of transportation. Jeepneys and buses are limited. Very few people own a vehicle. The town people usually ride a tricycle from their homes to market, church, to schools and to other destinations within their community. These vehicles even transport people from one town to the other. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue and improve her tricycle service, she is requesting a 50000 PHP loan, which she will use for maintenance of her tricycle and buy a secondhand side car. It is important that her tricycle is regularly maintained to ensure safe and efficient service. Her tricycle services mostly students in going to school. \r\n\r\nMaria Fe dreams of acquiring a small bus to service more students in their area. She wishes for all her children to finish college to allow them better opportunities in life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week to draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

In the past twenty years, he has bred more than one dairy cow and has developed his farm. He has also planted and sold a variety of crops.

However, he never gave up and he has been practicing farming. Because of how much he likes farming, he has even nicknamed one of his cows, which makes him a very proud farmer, especially when he is milking his cows. Through his dairy cow, he is able to get between 5-10 liters a day, and this helps him support his family. \r\n\r\nFredrick also practices crop farming, but he has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements, and that is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements.

The traditional foods that are in the most demand are \u2018locotos rellenos\u2019 (peppers, ground meat, onions), rice with cheese (rice, milk, and cheese), and \u2018aj\u00ed de panza\u2019 (tripe, onion, tomatoes on rice).  \u201cCooking is pretty tiring work.  All of the preparation demands time.  That is why I need to be completely stocked,\u201d she says.<br \/><br \/>The advantage of her business is her daily demand.  The disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy cooking supplies like cooking oil, rice, noodles, cassava, and meat, etc.<br \/><br \/>Her dream is for her children to become professionals.<br \/><br \/>She wishes to stock her business by purchasing supplies like cooking oil, rice, noodles, eggs, meat, potatoes, and freeze-dried potatoes, etc.  She will do this in order to sell her food continuously and improve her sales.  This is her fifth loan cycle with the institution in the ten years she has been engaged in this business activity.<br \/><br \/>It is for these reasons that Yudith is requesting a loan to buy cooking supplies to stock her food stand.

Do\u00f1a Aurelia chose the name because that was what her husband affectionately called her, she remembers fondly. The group comprises three women who are very kind. The community they live in is very tranquil, and a large segment of the population works making artisanal crafts, but they also cultivate corn.<br \/><br \/>Alejandra is a very cheerful young lady, but she is also very intelligent. She is nineteen years old, and married. She is the mother of a little girl who is not yet in school. \"Ale\" as she is affectionately called in the community, says that she has been driving a taxi for four years.<br \/><br \/>\"My dad was a taxi driver, and ever since I was very young, I loved going out with him to keep him company while he worked\", she says. Thanks to her dad's example, she is now one of the region's best taxi drivers. She learned to drive at the age of fifteen, and shortly afterward, her dad gave her his taxi. Alejandra provides her service very early in the morning, working twelve hours a day, from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM. She says, \"For us, time is money\".  While she is working, her mother-in-law takes care of her little girl, who is not yet attending school.<br \/><br \/>Alejandra is very happy because the loan will allow her to purchase replacement parts for her taxi, so that she can offer better service. In addition to being a great taxi driver, she also makes artisanal crafts such as knitted stockings, gloves, scarves, etc. She says that her grandmother and mother taught her to embroider when she was very young, and she says that every year in October she completely stops driving the taxi, and turns it over to her father, so that he can drive it while she prepares to travel to another state of Mexico on the first of November.  She sets herself up there for three months, and returns in January.  They have a permanent store there, where every day, they are embroidering and selling at the same time, and when they need more merchandise, they travel to the community to purchase more. <br \/><br \/>She doesn't want to miss any payments, because she hopes that they will grant her a new loan for investing in her artisanal crafts. The other members of the group are Susana and Aurelia, who will invest in embroidery.<br \/><br \/>The photograph was taken on the steps of the pavilion. Ale is holding the knitted stockings."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":570,"image":{"id":1942218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to purchase replacement parts and tires for her taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Ejido la Concepcion de los Ba\u00f1os, Ixtlahuaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-08-17T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-16T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4600},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4600},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4600},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4600},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":285,"local_amount":4600,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4609.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204498},{"amount":285,"local_amount":4600,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4609.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291919}],"funded_date":"2015-08-22T10:29:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanora Brennan","image":null}},{"id":932988,"name":"Wilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilma is managing a restaurant business in the Molave Public Market.

They have businesses such as: ceramic art, making sao hats, food sales, second-hand clothing sales, ice cream sales, upholstery services, and house painting.  \r\n\r\nHer own business is making and selling \"queques\" as a mobile vendor.  A \u201cqueque\" is a cake made from flour, eggs, milk, and sugar, which can be eaten at any hour of the day, either by itself or with tea or coffee.  She began her business in her home, using a minimal investment to sell \u201calfajores\" [another type of cake] and chocolate and vanilla queques, made with ingredients that are easy to find in the market.  When she had recovered her capital, she invested it in offering desserts to her customers.  \u201cMy specialties are chocolate and vanilla queques, which are in high demand mid-morning and mid-afternoon,\u201d she says.  \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that her queques are in demand and can be eaten at any time of day.  The disadvantage is her lack of capital to buy ingredients such as flour, eggs, and others.  Her dream is to open a fixed-location sales space.  She wants to buy in bulk various types of flour, sugar, eggs, and necessary ingredients for her business.  This is her first loan sequence with the institution in her year of carrying out this business.  It is because of all this that Hipsy is asking for a loan to buy ingredients for baking a variety of queques and also to open a fixed-location sales space.\r\n\r\nShe is pictured in the center,

She runs a cyber cafe. She is a good mother who is resourceful, dynamic, independent, responsible and very hard working. <br \/><br \/>Her business is situated in the 'Plan 3000' zone, which is known due to the origins of those who<br \/>live there: those part of the native Ayorea tribe, and miners originally from the east took over the area and introduced manufacture and commerce. <br \/><br \/>There is a hot, humid, sub-tropic climate with a daytime temperature ranging from 21 to 35 degrees centigrade. Maria has a dark complexion, brown eyes and long chestnut hair, and is short and strongly built. Her maternal language is Guaran\u00ed which is spoken in the area, but she also speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for her work. (she is standing on the left, wearing the pink sweater) <br \/><br \/>She lives with her partner, who works in commerce, and her children, the two oldest ones study in school, the younger two are not yet of school age. They live in their own home, built from bricks and cement, with a roof of corrugated iron and brick flooring. The house has electricity, running water and a sewage system. <br \/><br \/>Her desire for self improvement, from a need to help with her childrens' school fees, led her to set up a communal bank, including people with businesses such as: traditional food sales, ceramic handicrafts, sao hat making, second hand clothing sales, sales of fruit, vegetables, and soft drinks, in order to request a loan to improve their respective businesses. <br \/><br \/>Maria's business is a cyber cafe, she offers services such as: 100mb internet hire (including machine), printing, scanning, CPU maintenance, computing courses, drinks sales, photocopying and sales of computers and accessories. \"The boom of cyber cafe businesses has reduced a little, the secret of staying ahead is improving the quality, both of the equipment and the service..\" she says.

She lives with her partner and have 2 children who are 3 and 5 years old. Her business is the sale of fried chicken.\r\nShe is a good mother, patient, generous, responsible and very hardworking. She runs her business in the \"plan 3000\" zone, an area characterized by its multicultural population, the majority of whom are Aymar\u00e1s, Quechuas and Guaran\u00edes. The zone is located south of the city where migrants took over and developed a commercial zone that is constantly growing. Its climate is hot and sub tropical with temperature that varies during the day between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade. \r\nCarmen has a tan complexion, long dark updone hair, she is small of stature and has a robust physical built ([In the photo] she is in the center with a white purse). Her native language is Guaran\u00ed which is spoken in this area, and she speaks Spanish in everyday life and in her business. She shares her life with her partner who works in transportation, and with her children; the oldest is starting school and the youngest is not old enough to go to school yet. They live in a rented room built of brick and concrete with a corrugated iron roof, concrete floor and drinkable water, electricity and a septic system. At this time she is leading the entrepreneurial communal bank to take out a loan and achieve their dreams. Their businesses are: sewing, fish sales, empanada sales, cosmetic sales, seasonal clothing sales, construction services and neighborhood store. Carmen is in the business of selling fried chicken, which she sell in a street kiosk. Her food consists in tender pieces of chicken, coated in flour or in batter and then fried. What sets her fried chicken apart from other fried goods is that she usually cuts the pieces at the joints, leaving the bones and the skin intact. The distinctive feature of her fried chicken is the crispy, well seasoned skin that is never greasy. \u201cI will build a roof to protect my clients from the sun and the rain and to be the best in town,\" she said. The advantage of her business is that her sales are daily; the disadvantage is that she does not have enough money to build a roof to make her clients more comfortable.

This area is a primary milk and maize producing area. Jane is involved in both milk and maize production to provide for her family of 3 children. She has also invested in poultry farming and other side-businesses to earn additional income. <br \/><br \/>Jane has improved the 2 acre farm tremendously and employs 3 permanent staff to help her run the farm. She has a strategy in place that involves leveraging the business to ensure continuous growth of the farm into the future. She requests a loan to buy seeds and promote crop production. She will be able to secure more land space and farm supplies once the loan request is granted. Come next year when the season is over, she will be able to sell the harvest and make enough money to pay for farm costs for the subsequent seasons.

She sells dinner. She is a good mother, who is optimistic, happy, cheerful, spontaneous, responsible and very hard working. <br \/><br \/>Her business is situated in the 'Plan 3000' zone which is one of the cities which has experience the most growth, and is continuing to grow due to migration within the country, and in which great commercial and housing business ventures stand out, as well as in the health, education and service sectors. There is a hot, sub-tropical climate, with a temperature ranging from 21-35 degrees centigrade. <br \/><br \/>Maria has a dark complexion, brown eyes and long, straight black hair which she wears tied back, and is short and slender. Her maternal language is Guaran\u00ed which they speak within the family, but she also speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for her work (she is standing in the center, wrapped in a yellow blanket). She lives with her partner, who works in construction, and with her new born child. They live in a rented room, made from wood with a corrugated iron roof and brick flooring, which has running water, electricity and a sewage system. <br \/><br \/>The need to pay for the costs of having a new born baby led her to set up a communal bank with people running businesses such as: ceramic handicrafts, sao hat making, knitting, a bakery, flower sales, a butcher, and cheese sales, in order to request a loan to improve their respective businesses.<br \/><br \/>Her business is in dinner sales, she buys foods during the day to cook and sell in the evenings at dinner time. The most frequently requested meals are: majao (dried meat, rice, fried egg and fried banana), locro (stew with dried meat, chopped meat, cassava and egg) Sopa de Remojado (soup made from bones) and other things. \"The menu is relatively varied, there are several different options but it is not a whole ocean of foods. Much of the food is salads with different accompaniments, according to the type of food\" she says. <br \/><br \/>The advantage of her business is that she sells every day, the disadvantage is that she doesn't have the funds to buy a hamburger cart to offer hamburger sales. Her dream is to strengthen her business, she wishes to buy a hamburger cart so that she can sell hamburgers on the street during the day.

She is 32 years of age and has been farming for the past eight years. <br \/><br \/>Through those years, she has gathered so much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming and her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops, and some small businesses that she does so that she can make ends meet (posho mill). <br \/><br \/>Joan is very passionate about farming and she loves cultivating her farm. That is why every day she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. Although Joan makes profits through farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income through the selling of cereals. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy cereals. The Siongiroi area is one of the regions that is populated and has a high demand for cereals. That means that Joan will make more profits and be able to satisfy the demand that is there. <br \/><br \/>Accessing funds has been a challenge for Joan, but she feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Joan believes that this loan will be of much help and she will be able to satisfy the demand that is there for cereals. <br \/><br \/>She believes that the extra income will allow permanent change to her life and increase her business.

She is a rural farmer in Singiroi, Kenya, an area known for having bad terrain and a lack of proper infrastructure. She is blessed with a lovely family and has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. On her farm, she grows maize and she raises a dairy cow and poultry. She sells milk, eggs, and maize. To meet her expenses and provide the best for her family, she often engages in small personal businesses to make extra money. However, farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction, despite meager earnings. Nelly says, \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. For a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Nelly formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports small rural farmers. She acquired a dairy cow. The cow produces milk daily, which Nelly sells to a co-operative. \"The money from the milk comes regularly and is not very affected by sudden changes in weather if you have stored feed,\" says Nelly. The money Nelly got from selling the milk was adequate to repay the loan. \r\n\r\nToday, Nelly is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy cow because she is planning to become a full-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. With this loan, Nelly is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, good health and good livelihood. Her only dream is to continue growing her business and in the future to leave it to her children.\r\n\r\nNelly patiently waits for your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":93.41,"image":{"id":1945273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-17T16:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-16T16:40:13Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2477.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2549.45},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2623.95},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2700.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2779.57},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2860.8},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2944.4},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.45},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3119.02},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3210.17},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3400.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.41,"local_amount":9340.74,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":9501,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024081}],"funded_date":"2015-09-09T17:41:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Fitzgerald","image":null}},{"id":926229,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet an amazing, honest and charming woman by the name of Grace.

Hello, lenders! Meet Sophia, a youthful 28-year-old farmer who is very kind, loving, and charming. She is based in Nyaki, a remote village in the Nkubu area of Kenya. For the past five years, she has been involved in mixed farming on her small piece of land. Her major sources of income are egg-selling, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. <br \/><br \/>Sophia is a farmer who truly needs help. At 28 years old, she has the enormous responsibility of taking care of her family and siblings. The situation is very difficult because Sophia does not have a job. Sophia passionately loves poultry farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about poultry farming, her response was \u201cfeeding my poultry.\u201d She sells eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and at the local market, and, because of high quality eggs, customers have been streaming into her compound and the demand has been overwhelming. <br \/><br \/>To be able to meet the demand, Sophia is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan she will buy quality breeds of poultry that have high productivity and hence satisfy the demand that is there. The increased income level will be used in improving her living conditions, and she plans on expanding her business to other towns. <br \/><br \/>Other than increased profits, she will also benefit from poultry manure which will be used in her vegetable garden to increase productivity.

Like many farmers in the region, she has a dairy cow. Nandihills has a thriving market for dairy products. Tereza has sustained herself through dairy farming for seven years now. She enjoys the farming lifestyle. She has a connection with farm animals that goes so deep that she even names each of them. She has aspirations of expanding her dairy farm, but due to financial constraints, she has been unable to do so until now. From Kiva lenders, Tereza is borrowing KES 46,575 to purchase a high yielding dairy cow. This cow will boost milk production in the farm. As a result, she will have more quantity for both consumption and sales. With the money from the additional sales, she will be able to service her loan on time.

Eunice enjoys farming, which she has been doing on her small piece of land for the past five years. Through all those years, she has gained much experience and is one of the most respected farmers in her village. Because of the immense knowledge that she has of dairy farming, Eunice offers extension services to other farmers who are new to the business. Being a caring and loving mother, Eunice has been able to take care of her family and support them through the profits she has earned from farming. Although Eunice reaps much profit from farming, one challenge that she is facing that is dragging her down and preventing her from reaching her goal is lack of enough land to farm. For this reason, Eunice is seeking a loan of KES 45,000 to buy a piece of land and expand her farming activities. Having so much experience in farming, Eunice is sure that she will make good use of the land and double her profit levels. Through the profits, she would be able to repay the loan and improve her living conditions.

Regina has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. <br \/><br \/>She passionately loves dairy farming. Villagers have nicknamed her Mrs. Cow. Regina sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but her cows have started to produce low quantities of milk because they are sick because they lack a proper dairy unit where they can stay. For this reason, she is requesting a loan to build a modern dairy unit. <br \/><br \/>Through the loan she will be able to build a good place where her cows can relax and also where they will least be affected by harsh weather conditions such as rain and sunlight.

They have 2 sons, ages 13 and 14, and a 17-year-old daughter. Tania runs a business making briefcases. She is a good mother and an enterprising, independent, patient, tenacious, responsible, and very hardworking person. Her business is located in the area 'Agua de vida' (Water of Life), who got its name from being a place where lots of waterholes and underground springs are found. Because of this, many residents don't have running water, but they do have spring water. The area has a cold and dry climate with temperatures that vary between 1-12 degrees Celsius during the day. <br \/><br \/>Tania has a dark complexion, brown eyes, long black hair that she ties back, a short stature, and a robust physique. Her native language is Aymara, which she speaks with her family. She also speaks Spanish from general knowledge and because of her business. Her life is shared with her partner who works in construction and with her son who doesn't go to school yet. They live in a brick and cement room with a corrugated iron roof and a wood floor. They have spring water from a tank and electricity, but they don't have a sewer system. <br \/><br \/>Tania runs a business making briefcases and garments wholesale and by request. She makes briefcases for conferences, seminars, workshops, etc., activities where the organizers give the students a briefcase with other study materials for development. \"I have ongoing customers who request briefcases for their seminars and events,\" she says. The advantage of her business is that sales are made wholesale. The disadvantage is the lack of funds to buy material, such as imitation leather, zippers, thread, etc. <br \/><br \/>Tania's dream is to have the resources to fulfill all her orders. She wants to purchase material to make 150 briefcases. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 10 years that she's had her business. Because of these reasons, Tania is requesting a loan to buy material to make 150 briefcases."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":155.96,"image":{"id":1942817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

lenders! Meet Esther, 46, who is based in the Nandihills area of Kenya. This area is the major tea growing region of the country, but it is increasingly emerging as an important dairy farming zone for East Africa. Thousands of farmers are now finding dairy farming a good supplement, if not a substitute, for maize farming. This handsome mother has been practicing mixed farming for the past 16 years, and her primary source of income has been milk and eggs. She passionately loves dairy farming. She enjoys feeding her cows, and milking her cow is her hobby. Waking up every morning to milk her cow is very fulfilling for her. <br \/><br \/>The biggest challenge she faces is the lack of a proper dairy unit where her cows can feed and rest. Because of this, she has suffered losses through diseases that attack her cows due to the harsh weather conditions. If you are to reap more from cows, you must feed them properly to get high quality milk. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to build a modern dairy unit. With the loan, she will be able to increase her milk production, improve her living conditions, and secure the future of her school-going children. Thanks to the support from Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders, she will be able to build this business and become independent.<br \/><br \/>Esther wants to do everything, but she needs a little help that

Meet Gladys, a young farmer from Nandihills County in Kenya who has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture. Gladys is the proud owner of a small parcel of land on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, and some variety of crops she plants. She also engages in some personal business to make ends meet. <br \/><br \/>Gladys passionately loves farming, and she says that she got interested in farming out of a desire to be a solution to food security, which remains a thorn in the flesh for all the farmers in Nandihills, and Africa as a whole. From farming, she has been able to earn a decent income, and she attributes all this success to hard work and determination. Although she makes profits, she has always wanted to increase her farming and start a cereal-selling business. The main challenge she has been facing is lack of funds. <br \/><br \/>She is seeking a loan to buy cereals.

She is 29 years old and lives with her husband in the Nandihills area of Kenya. She is blessed with two children who are her greatest motivation in life. She perseveres because she wants to provide a better future for them. Ann was unable to study to have a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past ten years. <br \/><br \/>Ann has always had an affinity for farming, and it runs in her blood. Because of how much she likes farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows, which makes her a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. Her cows produce between 10-15 liters a day; this helps her support her family. Ann also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming inputs. <br \/><br \/>That is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm inputs. Through the loan, she will be able to purchase high-quality seeds, good fertilizer, and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. <br \/><br \/>Ann is very visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production over the previous year.

She is from the Siongiroi area, an area that is very affected by poverty, inequality and social conflict. With work and effort and without complaint, she wants to bring her family ahead. Christina has spent the past 10 years of her life farming. She sells milk, poultry, and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in a personal business to make ends meet. Christina is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. <br \/><br \/>Of all the activities she is involved in, dairy farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and milk her cows and feed them with fodder that has high nutrient value. She is so keen and close with her cows, she has named them, which makes Christina very proud, and she feels fulfilled. Dairy farming being a very profitable business venture, Christina wants to take full advantage. She would like to expand her dairy business, but the biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital to grow with. <br \/><br \/>She is requesting a loan which she will use to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. Christina has grass, so feeding the cows will never be a challenge. She also owns an expansive piece of land, and the excess space will be productively used once she acquires the additional dairy cow. The \"exotic\" cow she will buy will produce between 8 and 10 liters of milk per day, and this will translate to more income and profits. The profits from selling milk will allow Christina to grow her business further, by starting to package milk and by processing it into other dairy products. In addition, she will benefit from the organic manure from the cow. She projects that she will be able to start a biogas plant at her farm, which will save her money in fuel costs. With your loan, all that Christina dreams of is a secure future for her family. Christina awaits your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":156.86,"image":{"id":1947151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality breed of dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-17T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-16T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2016-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.42},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.87},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.06},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.29},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.56},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.86},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.2},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.69,"local_amount":4269.37,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4330.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711507195},{"amount":36.19,"local_amount":3618.98,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3670.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024108},{"amount":77.98,"local_amount":7798.14,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7909,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112198}],"funded_date":"2015-08-24T15:29:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":930744,"name":"Venessa Katherine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vanessa is a young lady, 27 years old.
